         "Acquisition of  State Bank Corp by Glacier Bancorp, Inc Call",
         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Glacier Bancorp, Incorporated Investor Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today Mr. Randy Chesler, President and CEO of Glacier Bancorp. Please go ahead sir. Well thank you, Joelle. Hey, good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm here in beautiful Lake Havasu City, Arizona, very excited to tell you about our most recent transaction. Joining me on the phone from Kalispell is Ron Copher, our Chief Financial Officer; and Don Chery, our Chief Administrative Officer. Last night after the close of business, we announced our agreement to acquire State Bank Corporation, the holding company for State Bank of Arizona, a community bank based in Lake Havasu City. At $679 million in assets, State Bank is the oldest and largest community bank headquartered in Arizona. And more specifically, is the largest community bank in both the Lake Havasu City and Prescott Valley MSA by deposits. In addition, the bank serves the markets of Kingman, Bullhead City, Cottonwood and Phoenix. There are limited number of good quality community banks in Arizona and a lot of interest among competitors to grow or expand into the market. State Bank is clearly the best choice to help us build scale and further expand our existing Arizona presence. So, Ron and Don and I have been talking with the CEO of State Bank, Brian Riley for a number of years about the possibility of a strategic combination. The more we learned about the people and business of State Bank, the more interested we became in finalizing a partnership. We couldn't be more pleased than to be on the phone with you today to tell you about this transaction. So to jump right into the investor presentation, page 3 outlines the transaction. This will be our 23rd announced acquisition since 2000 and our 12th in the last seven years. 2019 has been a great year for acquisitions with both our previously announced First National Bank of Layton and Heritage Bank of Reno transactions already closed and adding over $1.1 billion in assets this year. Upon closing, State Bank will merge into Glacier's existing Foothills Bank Division and build the scale of Foothills to become Glacier's fifth banking division with assets in excess of $1 billion. In addition, with this transaction, Arizona will now be Glacier's fourth largest market measured by gross loans and fifth measured by assets and total deposits. I should also point out that including State Bank of Arizona, this will be a record acquisition year for Glacier with over $1.8 billion in announced transactions in 2019. The Glacier team has done an exceptional job assessing, closing and beginning the integration on these transactions and this demonstrates the very deep bench of talent we have, where we're able to make this happen. The transaction is a part cash stock deal with State Bank shareholders receiving 0.376 (sic) [0.3706] shares of Glacier's common stock, in addition to $1.69 in cash. And based on GBCI's closing price last Friday at $40.43, this results in an aggregate deal value of $135.3 million. We are particularly excited to have found a partner with high quality community bank focus and a very strong core deposit base. About 96% of the deposits are core and State Bank has a 53 basis points cost of funds and a very strong yield, a loan yield of 5.63%. We anticipate closing this transaction in late fourth quarter 2019 or first quarter 2020, of course dependent on regulatory approvals. The State Bank transaction has a great risk/reward profile. From a financial perspective, the transaction is immediately accretive to EPS with a tangible book value earn-back of about 1.9 years, which is lower than our historical median for closed acquisitions. We believe the execution risk on this transaction is low because of the strong cultural fit and the retention of most of the employees of both banks. And most importantly, because we have already spent a lot of time working through the roles in the combined bank. Turning to page 4, the acquisition of State Bank is consistent with our strategy of buying good banks in good markets with good people. This transaction not only adds scale to our existing Foothills Bank Division, but also increases market share in one of the fastest growing states in the US. The combined entity will operate as Foothills Bank, continuing Foothills' over 20 years of serving Arizona communities. And this transaction moves Glacier to a number 15 position based on deposit share in Arizona and creates a leading community bank in the state. If you turn to page 5, you can see the very strong economic environment in Arizona. In 2018, the state was ranked fourth in real GDP growth in the US, third in economic momentum, and fourth in population growth. Arizona is also a very business-friendly state ranked number seven for the best state to do business by Chief Executive in 2019, very important. We think all of these facts point to a continued bright growth outlook for the state. It's a state we are familiar with and very happy with, and one which we look forward to serving on a much larger scale. Page 6 outlines State Bank's attractive financial profile. Having been named Bank of the Year last year by Western Independent Bankers, it's an efficient operator with a healthy net interest margin of 3.84% and strong asset quality. Other notable metrics include a loan to deposit ratio of approximately 70% and a cost of deposits of 53 basis points. With this transaction, we will have our presence in the top six MSAs in Arizona and have a leadership position in three of the MSAs; Prescott with a population of over 230,000, Yuma with a population of over 200,000 and Lake Havasu also with a population over 200,000. We are very excited to be a leader in these communities and to be positioned for future growth in all of the top six MSAs. If you turn to page 7, you see a large majority of Arizona's banking market is controlled by money center banks, and we think this presents a tremendous opportunity to grow over time by offering targeted customers a very attractive community banking alternative. This transaction drastically increases our scale in Arizona, again making us the 15th largest bank by deposits in the state. It's a great opportunity for us to expand our Arizona footprint and gain meaningful market share in Arizona. Pages 8 and 9 of the investor deck outline the transaction and our assumptions, which as I mentioned earlier are very consistent with our historic conservative approach on acquisitions. We're very happy with the metrics of this deal and State Bank shareholders will receive 0.37 shares of Glacier stock and the $1.69 in cash, which I mentioned previously. Cost savings assumption is 24%. If you look at the multiple on 2019 earnings with this cost savings, it's a very attractive 11 times. And we're very comfortable that the cost savings are conservative consistent – very consistent with our recent First Security Bank of Bozeman acquisition in 2018, which was our last bolt-on transaction. We've already put a lot of time in with the Foothills and the State Bank teams to carefully plan this combination and partnership. The transaction is immediately accretive to Glacier's earnings per share and the internal rate of return is expected to be in excess of 15%. And the minimal tangible book value dilution is earned back in 1.9 years using the cross-over method. So in conclusion, we believe this transaction is highly accretive to our franchise. The financial pro formas are very attractive and it's consistent with our history of buying good banks in good markets with good people. We're very excited to welcome the talented State Bank team and their board of directors to the GBCI team. At this point, I'll end my comments. And Joelle, I'll turn the call back over to you for any questions from our analysts. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Andrew Liesch with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Good morning everyone. Congrats on the deal. Good morning, Andrew. Thank you. This is now your third transaction announced this year; I'm just curious what's your appetite for more deals in the near future? I think that, like I said, this is a record year for us. So, the door is always open. But I think right now we're really happy with the transactions that we announced in 2019 and the two that we closed, First National Bank of Layton and Heritage Bank of Reno. So, our focus now is to do a great job with this transaction, but we continue to talk to folks and keep the door open. Okay. Great. I'm just curious like this is now the third one as I said. Like what's the chatter been lately? Has there been a pickup in conversations or inbound interest like how much – what would be the pace of the deal conversations relative to say three or six months ago? I think it's about the same Andrew. If anything, it maybe tailed off a tad, but generally, I think the deal flow in the incoming has been pretty consistent. Okay. Thanks. Those are my questions. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good morning, Randy. Morning, Jeff. Question on the cost saves, you mentioned pretty conservative number. Looks like the only real overlap would be in Prescott. Any thoughts on potential for branch closures and if not kind of the bulk of the cost saves is that more back-office oriented? Yeah. By far back-office oriented. Prescott, we're looking at that with Brian and Mary Lynn are the Foothills President. I think we'll hone that in, but there's likely some opportunity for some consolidation there, but the branches there operate pretty close to each other, so very minimal – depending on what we do, it'll be very minimal customer disruption. Okay. And does the bank have any ag exposure not a traditional ag state but, I don't know, in the dairy side of things or anything? No, when we looked at the portfolio very – very, much more commercial oriented, very little, if any, ag exposure. Okay. And the thought on taking kind of the Foothills name, is it because it's more longer tenured in the state or what was the thought process there? Yeah, no that – and we put a lot of thought into that. And we are taking the same approach we used with our First Security Bank of Bozeman that we did last year and that – we look at what would be least disruptive to the customers. And in this particular case, Foothills is a name that's been in place for a longer period of time and we felt that that would be the easiest transition, less disruptive to the customers. And we think that in the end the customers are most interested in just making sure they see the same people in the bank when they walk-in and we're very comfortable that that will be part of this partnership. So, Foothills has been in the market serving Arizona communities for 20-plus years, so we just, after a lot of thought decided that would be the best way to go. Got it. Maybe one last one. Just the thought on maybe this transaction kind of the reason for selling, but as you've kind of gathered more thoughts about conversations and targets and those folks' reasoning for selling, do you have the sense that it's kind of timing on the kind of economic kind of cycle or is it regulatory, is it credit rate, do you get a sense for, I mean generally an opportunity to link up with a larger operator, but any sense of how that tone has changed from a seller's perspective? Yeah, I can't speak to the broader market. I would tell you, in this particular case, we've been talking to Brian Riley, who's the CEO of State Bank for a number of years about a partnership. I'd say in this particular case, the bank was extremely diligent and evaluating a lot of different options, and I think that they just decided this would be a great option. But I would tell you they were in no hurry to rush into a transaction. I think if we weren't able to work this out in a way that both sides felt really good about they would have been very happy just continuing on the path they're on. Great. Thank you. You bet. Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Hi. Good morning. Morning, Matthew. In the deck, you mentioned that you've assumed a lower net interest margin in response to a lower rate environment. Can you give us a sense for the underlying NIM assumption for State Bank relative to the 3.84% that they just most recently put up maybe for the upcoming year? Yeah. We took – obviously, in this interest rate environment, we took a very hard look at that trying to – modeling the sensitivity and looking at their information and looking at our own. They've got a very strong book, looks a lot like Glacier's book in terms of its repricing kind of velocity and how it reprices. So, there's some lift in there, but we just kept everything flat for our forecasts and felt – given kind of the – what we saw on the portfolio that was a conservative outlook for us. Okay. And then, just on the underlying balance sheet growth assumptions as well relative to the 1% to 1.5% accretion for 2021, what kind of the ranges, expectations there? There's a lot of opportunity to grow. Our Foothills Bank has been one of the fastest growing divisions in our company. State Bank is extremely well positioned for growth. We've throttled that back and just made their growth assumptions consistent with our own, the total company growth forecast. Okay. Okay. And then just on the securities portfolio. I guess, what are the plans for that book at state given its relative size to the company and how you might reinvest it? Yeah. So Ron, and our treasurer, Byron take a close look at that and it will be reinvested. So, we take a look at the portfolio. And we're generally able to create a little more lift just given our ability to go out a little bit longer, be a little more flexible. Obviously, as banks get closer to contemplating a transaction, they tend to get a little more liquid, and so, as we pull those things back in, we expect a lift there. We don't really factor that into our thinking, but that's something that we think will happen. Okay. And then just last one for me. It doesn't look like there was a CECL adjustment in the tangible book value dilution, partly due to the timing on the close I would assume. But I guess, do you have any expectation for what that mark might be as we get into 2020? Yeah. We took detailed look, modeled it out, very minimal if negligible impact because of the size of this transaction, relative to Glacier, the quality of the portfolio, really is a negligible impact. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Coffey with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. Morning, Randy. Morning Tim. Hey, you've previously said that Canada is a sweet spot for acquisitions in terms of size or kind of that $500 million to $1 billion range. This tends to be at the low end. Were there attributes of the franchise that were attractive to you other than just kind of the adding scale in the Arizona market for the qualities of that market that you already mentioned? Yeah, you're right. This really does fit in our wheelhouse that $500 million to $1 billion. And this was a very attractive opportunity. We talked about the scale. But from a competitive standpoint, it gives us an opportunity to really strongly position ourselves in a state that is really underserved by good community banks. And so, when you think about being present in all top six MSAs of a state with the economic profile that I kind of went through in the presentation, it's a strategically significant opportunity. And so, it also helped that this actually was the biggest community bank in the state other than Western Alliance. Everything else here is pretty much at $300 million or less. And so, this was the largest community bank available in what we think is a tremendous, tremendous market. Okay. Great. Thanks. Rest of my questions have been answered. All right. Thank you. Thank you.  Our next question comes from Luke Wooten with KBW. Your line is now open. Good morning Randy. Good morning, Luke. Yeah. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the – you guys mentioned it a little bit in the slide deck, but just to kind of expand on it – on the ability to take share in the Arizona market. I know you pointed out that 75% of it is controlled by the money centers, and I didn't know if that ability to take share kind of included de novo's or kind of just branching out from the existing franchise there. Yeah. For right now, like I said we're positioned in the top six markets in the state. So, we have a foothold in all the places we want to be in the state. And so, right now, I think we've got a lot of opportunity to grow around the footprint we have. I think our strategy is to let's get this transaction done. And then, over time there may be some alternatives to take a look at, but right now given the footprint when you combine these two franchises, it's significant and it's what we need to compete. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just kind of given where you guys are in the year, two dividend raises, third announced acquisition, just kind of on capital going forward, I mean I imagine much more catered towards kind of acquisitive growth rather than just kind of dividend returned or – you guys don't do a whole lot of share buybacks. But just kind of how you guys look at that going forward and which capital ratios are kind of catered to, I guess, would be the best way to put it? Sure. CET1 is – we take, we focus on that and really, this doesn't signal any change on our strategy. We still consider ourselves a very, very consistent dividend payer. And I have a long-term strategy for double digit increase in – and EPS growth. So, we continue to stay focused on that. Our capital planning relative to acquisitions and dividends, we have our same approach that we take on that, don't really see any change here with this transaction or going forward. Okay. That's helpful. And that was all my questions, thank you for taking. You bet. Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Chesler for any further remarks. Okay. Thank you, Joelle. So, that's it. Again, we're very excited about this transaction and both – Ron, Don and I are here. If you have any questions, just give us a ring. We appreciate you dialing in this morning and wish you a great week and a fabulous weekend. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Review. With me are Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin your conference. Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterward, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the risk factors section of our Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Than you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported earnings of $4.9 billion for the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $2.07 were 20% higher than a year ago. Our return on tangible common equity was 12.2%, bringing our year-to-date return to 12%, which remains our target for the year. We also had loan and deposit growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. We again saw balanced underlying growth in Global Consumer Banking with a 4% increase in revenues and EBIT growth of 17%. In North America, growth in our Branded Cards business accelerated to 11% from last year. Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand and scale in credit cards to drive deeper multiproduct relationships with our clients. Internationally, EBIT was up 26% excluding the gain on sale last year. In Mexico, we continued to manage through a slower growth environment through expense and credit discipline. In Asia, investor sentiment continued to improve, resulting in higher wealth management revenues. Our Institutional Clients Group also had balanced performance with solid results in both the market-sensitive and accrual-type businesses. Our share gains continued in Investment Banking, while our markets performance showed resilience due to strong client engagement. The backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions had strong revenue growth of 7% in constant dollars, while the Private Bank grew as well. In addition to achieving stronger business performance, we remained focus on improving the returns we deliver to our shareholders through our capital planning. Consistent with the commitment we made in 2017, we remain on pace to return over $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over a three-year period, which ends next year. The plan includes significant buybacks, which have lowered our common shares outstanding by 259 million shares or 11% in the last year alone. Combined with 6% growth in net income, they've helped drive our tangible book value per share up 12%. For now, we're focused on closing out the year and planning for 2020. The environment is highly unpredictable given how much of it is at the mercy of political machinations, whether it's trade negotiations or even the elusive resolution on Brexit. We will help our clients navigate these choppy waters while also being flexible and adaptable when it comes to our own resource allocation. Despite it all, we remain committed to investing in the products in which we see the best growth opportunities as well as in our own infrastructure for the purpose of safety and soundness. We have the leading global network and we're going to maximize our competitive advantages. I'll now turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year, and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250-million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our Consumer and Institutional businesses. Expenses increased 1% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in Consumer while overall credit quality remains stable. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%, better than our outlook, reflecting discrete tax items. The discrete tax items equate to a benefit of $0.10 per share this quarter. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been roughly 22%. In constant dollars, end of period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $692 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets. And deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our Consumer and Institutional franchises. Looking at year-to-date results on slide 4, revenues were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the roughly $150-million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico. Overall, Consumer revenues have grown 4%, roughly in line with our medium term expectations. On the Institutional side, revenues were up 2% year-to-date with continued growth in our accrual businesses. Expenses declined 1% year-to-date even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise, and the underlying pre-tax earnings grew by 4%. EPS grew by 17%, and we generated an ROTCE of 12%, in line with our expectations for the full year. Turning now to the businesses, slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The Consumer business showed continued momentum in the third quarter. Excluding the gain last year, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. And looking at year-to-date results in Consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pre-tax earnings. Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail. Third quarter revenues of $5.4 billion were up 4% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to make progress towards a more integrated client-centric relationship model. Our deposit momentum continued to improve. Year-to-date total net deposit inflows more than tripled compared with last year with strength across both traditional and digital channels. We've seen accelerating growth in deposits raised through digital channels. We generated nearly $2 billion in digital deposit sales in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to over $4 billion. Consistent with our strategy to drive towards national scale in retail, nearly two-thirds of these deposit sales were outside of our existing branch footprint. And of this amount, roughly half were with card customers who previously did not have a Retail Banking relationship with us. Our experience to date gives us confidence in our digital capabilities and engagement model, and provides a solid foundation for deepening these relationships over time. And while most of the products we've introduced so far have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs, you'll see us expand into more partner programs as we move forward. Turning now to the results of the individual businesses, Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 2% year-over-year as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposit growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year, and looking at average deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew customer balances by 5%. Turning to Branded Cards, revenues of $2.3 billion grew 11% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7%, and average loan growth improved to 3%. We continued to generate higher growth in interest-earning balances this quarter, up 9%. This growth in interest-earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans to 914 basis points this quarter. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 1%, driven by organic loan growth. Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume-related expenses. Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both Cards portfolios. Our NCL rates in US Branded Cards and Retail Services were 312 basis points and 477 basis points, respectively, this quarter, consistently with our full year guidance. On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Third quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%, excluding the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. On this basis, Latin America Consumer revenues grew 3%. Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year. Turning to Asia, Consumer revenues grew 5% in the third quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 9% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year. In total, operating expenses were largely unchanged in the third quarter as efficiency savings offset investment spending and volume-driven growth. And cost of credit was down 12%, reflecting a modest LLR release relative to a build in the prior year. Slide 8 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 9. Revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by softness in Equity Markets and Corporate Lending. Total Banking revenues of $5 billion were up 3%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as we continue to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression. We would expect the underlying business drivers to continue to perform well in TTS given our unique global footprint and ability to deliver integrated solutions to our multinational clients despite continued uncertainty around the macro environment. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA. Private Bank revenues of $867 million were up 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression. And Corporate Lending revenues of $527 million were down 6%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging costs. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 1% from last year. Fixed Income revenues were roughly flat, although we did see better activity with both corporate and investor clients as well as a solid quarter in rates and currencies, particularly in G10 rates. Equities revenues were down 4%, primarily reflecting lower client activity and lower balances in prime brokerage, partially offset by strong client activity in derivatives. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis but up 2% in constant dollars, reflecting higher volumes from new and existing clients. Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year as investments, volume-driven growth, and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings. And credit quality remained strong, consistent with our target client strategy. Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in Equity Markets revenues. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $402 million declined 18% from last year, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses increased 6%, reflecting higher infrastructure costs partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets. And the pre-tax loss was $68 million this quarter, in line with our outlook. Looking ahead, we would expect a pre-tax loss in the range of $100 million to $150 million in Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in infrastructure and control. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue split between our Markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding Markets on the top of the slide. As you can see, year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars driven by 5% growth ex-Markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge. Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower Markets net interest revenue. And net interest margin declined 11 basis points sequentially, also driven by the lower Markets net interest revenue. However, it is important to note that the decline in Markets net interest revenue is almost fully offset by higher noninterest revenue in Markets this quarter, shown at the bottom of the slide. And turning to total noninterest revenue for total Citigroup. This quarter we generated strong year-over-year growth in noninterest revenue of roughly $350 million, driven by growth across the franchise including higher Markets noninterest revenue even as we faced the headwind of the $250-million gain last year, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver better growth next quarter in noninterest revenue. So while we did see pressure in net interest revenues driven by the dynamics seen this quarter in Markets which could continue into the fourth quarter, in total for Citigroup, we remain comfortable in our ability to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis driven by net interest revenue growth of 2% to 3% in constant dollars for the full year, below our original forecast given the dynamic I just mentioned in Markets, but offset by higher noninterest revenue which should be better than our original forecast of at least flat to 2018 on a full year basis. So again, in aggregate for total Citigroup, we still expect to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, but the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 12% year-over-year to $69.03 driven by net income and the lower share count. And our CET1 ratio declined sequentially to 11.6% as net income was offset by $6.3 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends along with an increase in risk weighted assets. Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but we are not anticipating a repeat of the challenging trading environment seen in the fourth quarter of last year. And in our accrual businesses, revenue should benefit from continued strong client engagement and higher volumes. However, we would expect this to be somewhat offset by spread compression given the lower interest rate environment. In Consumer, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in all regions driven by continued loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially, cost of credit should continue to grow modestly, and importantly, we expect solid pre-tax earnings growth year-over-year. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, absent any discrete tax items. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if I could... Good morning. ...just get a follow-up on Branded Cards. The 11% growth in the quarter, can you talk about or give us a breakdown of where that's being derived, what you're doing to incent that growth? I think I heard your comment about where part of the relationship is coming and how you're growing in the Bank on nonbank customers through the card portfolio. But focus specifically on the 11% growth in Branded Cards, talk about balance transfer and how the  underwriting box (00:22:38) you're writing to. Thank you. Sorry about that jumbled question. That's okay. Thank you. So I guess what I would point to on Branded Cards is a couple things. One, we're seeing, as we've mentioned on a number of quarters now, the conversion from promotional type offerings that we've made and balances to average interest earning balances. And so this is a continuation of customers that we have that we brought on a couple years ago through promotional offerings who weren't paying any interest to now converting to interest earning balances, and that's fueling part of the growth. You'll see purchase sales are up 7% in the quarter. You see the loan volumes are up as well. And so we're getting continued use of the card, top of wallet use, as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest earning balances for us. And that should – that's been the case for the past number of quarters. We'd expect that to continue to play out in the fourth quarter and continue to get some spread benefits. But likely going forward well into 2020, the benefits will continue to play out from a volume point of view. So volume growth will continue to be an important factor as well. And what you're doing on the promotional balances offers, I just noted some long 21-month type offers out there. Just don't know if that's a growing percentage of the book or just tweaking out the margin. We kind of reached the mix, our desired mix of promotional balances that we're looking to have in the portfolio. Now, what you would imagine is once you strike that balance between promotional and the interest earnings you've got to maintain that balance, which means we'll continue to do promotional offerings going forward at the pace we've been running at in order to maintain that mix. And as those promotional balances mature, they ultimately convert into interest-earning. And so they fuel kind of the go-forward growth and they're important parts of – or it's an important part of our investment strategy as we execute on the Branded Cards strategy. Got it. And then maybe a last follow-up on that. The flip side of that is I know the desire to deepen the existing card relationships and convert card customers that don't have other banking relationship with you, what exactly are you doing to penetrate that? It sounds like it's starting to work. Yeah. So, it is starting to work. I think I referenced earlier the growth in digital deposit sales and referenced that in fact a good portion of that is coming from card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us. As we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open up a Retail Banking account with us. So, for example, we know which of our card customers enjoy and prefer our ThankYou Rewards programs and which of our card customers respond to many of the other programs that we offer from a rewards point of view. And so we're able to create packages for them that reward them with benefits they respond to, like ThankYou Points, if they're willing to open a Retail Banking account with us digitally. And clients are responding. And so our ability to mine that data, to create value propositions around things that our clients are motivated to – or motivated with has resulted in the growth that we're speaking to now. And I think the other piece of that, Glenn, is so far we have done that exclusively with our own proprietary products. But in the not-too-distant future, we'll be rolling that out to some of our co-brand as well as some of our retail partners. So, I think we've got the ability to continue to expand on that. Yeah. Okay. Thanks so much. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Hi. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask... Good morning. ...about ROTCE targets. Mark, just wanted to confirm for 2019 still feeling good about 12% or darn close to 12% for this year given your fourth quarter outlook. And then for next year, obviously for both of you, the environment's gotten tougher. We all know that. And 13.5%, your prior target for ROTCE, feels ambitious in this environment. Mark, you acknowledged that at the Barclay's conference. But how are you guys going to think about it as you go through your planning and what to target for kind of 2020 as you balance wanting to show improvement in ROTCE versus what might be a more difficult environment? Sure. So first on your first point, John, the 12% remains our target. As you pointed out, we did 12.2% ROTCE this quarter and we're at 12% year-to-date. And so that remains the target. And we feel as though we'll get to that number or darn close as I've said and now you've said as well. In terms of the 13.5% for 2020, I've said at the Barclay's and I'll say again, and Mike alluded to it, it's a very different environment than I think we expected kind of coming into the year. There was a fair amount of uncertainty that remains. 13.5% remains the target, but we are now in the midst of our budgeting process and we need to factor in the uncertainty that's in the environment, what that's likely to look like or how that's likely to play out, what the impact, the full year impact in 2020 of the rate reductions might be, what we think client demand is going to look like. And there are puts and takes there in parts of the business. There will be pressure from some of this uncertainty. In parts of the business like Markets there could be some positive as we see volatility persist. And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that top line is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress, and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets. And I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that I very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things. Not just – I think as you probably heard more broadly this morning in terms of the US. But when you globally look at the Consumer, the Consumer's in fine shape. We saw the IMF come out this morning and revised growth downward. I would describe that probably more as a catch-up to where many of us have been than necessarily any new information, i.e. 3% global growth. So not as high as we'd like it to be, but 3% global growth is still growth. And so I think a lot of it really depends on how our clients see themselves positioning in terms of CapEx, in terms of investment spend, in terms of hiring. And I don't think we want to be premature in any way in either direction of reading too much into that. And so we want to get our businesses in a room. We want to continue to glean information from our clients not just here in the US but around the world in terms of how they're thinking about things. And I think as the past several years have shown, last year is a great example, the closer we can get to the year as opposed to kind of prejudging this early before we declare anything, I think the better and more informed we'll be able to come back. And I guess just to push you guys a little bit, the absolute level of ROTCE is quite a bit below peers and I think what most people would think your franchise should be able to do on paper. With that in mind, even in this environment, Mike, do you hope to push to do better than you do in 2019? Like, is that a – is a goal that you think is definitely reachable to do better next year than this year? Absolutely. I think we've got to continue to show progress and we've got to continue to narrow that gap. Okay. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, guys. Just maybe first on ICG a little bit, was a little surprised expenses were up quarter-over-quarter despite revenues being down. I know you had taken some severance in the first quarter and I thought the messaging was that you'd start to see those expenses come out in the back half of the year. Was it just volume? Was it investment or any other severance in there? How do we think about the trajectory in ICG expenses? Sure. So, yes, the expenses were up 4%. There are investments that we're making in the ICG, particularly in our TTS business and how we improve the client experience and deepen some of those client relationships, and those investments obviously are critically important. There's some volume-driven growth tied to it largely around transactional expenses, and then there are some compensation cost as well. So there's the higher performance from a base compensation point of view. There's some strategic hires that we made in parts of the franchise. And then lastly, and you alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter as well as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets and as we thought about kind of the long term or longer term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments. And those capacity adjustments obviously come with a cost, and so that is part of the – what you see in the quarter as well in that 4% increase. So you feel that even in a lower growth,  in a (00:33:32) negative growth, lower growth environment you can still get the operating leverage over the intermediate term,  positive (00:33:38) operating leverage? Yeah, we think we – Look. I mean, obviously in adjusting the capacity here we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020. What will matter obviously is the top line and how wallets continue to evolve and how much share we're able to continue to capture. But we think we will continue to be able to run the business efficiently and perform accordingly. Right. Fair enough. And then maybe just on deposits, really strong growth on a period-end basis, particularly in ICG. Is that sort of end of quarter balance sheet positioning by some of your clients and that's rolling off? Or do you think that's sort of some sustainable growth? And if so, what's driving that? Yeah, we actually – you're right. We did see strong growth in the deposits across the board, in TTS specifically as well. It's across all regions in TTS. Frankly, it's with both new and existing clients. The majority of the deposit growth consisted of operating deposits, which is good. And frankly, about a quarter of the growth in operating deposits were from new or renewed clients. And so we're actively engaged with our clients. We're seeing opportunities to roll out our broad solutions with them, and we think that is likely to continue. Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. Hey, Mike. First, look, you're growing revenues faster than expenses. This was the 12th quarter in a row that you didn't call it out that way. I think I estimate you made it year-over-year by one-fifth of 1% of revenues. Revenues grew faster than expenses, so you made it. So the question is, growing revenues faster than expenses, when you look back a bit ago you were kind of doing it by like a touchdown or two. Then it went down to a couple field goals. Now it seems like you're exceeding it by an extra point, to push the analogy. So the question is, how confident are you to continue that string of revenues growing faster than expenses year-over-year? And what is the role of technology in helping you do so? So, look, you're right. We have reflected positive operating margin. We expect that to continue for the full year of 2019. And as we've talked about when we describe both 2019 and 2020, we've talked about plus or minus GDP growth on the top line, roughly flat expenses. And we expect to deliver that for 2019. So, yes. Positive operating leverage and operating margin is what we're expecting to deliver. Mike, you want to take the technology piece? Sure. Well, I think there's a couple pieces I'd add too. So one here, Mike, I think is if you go and you look at the numbers, I would say relatively quietly, as Mark alluded to over the past year, our head count is down by about 7,000, so somewhere between 3% and 4%. That has been almost exclusively focused on capacity at the frontend. It hasn't really been focused or aimed at infrastructure. And so when we came into the year, what we told you is we would be going at every lever and looking at all the things that we could do, and I think this year we've done that. I think clearly technology, when you go back to slide 23 and look at our Consumer business and some of the drivers around contact, around contact rates, digital and mobile engagement, E-statement penetration, all of those moving I think very nicely in the right direction. And those continue to give us not only cost benefits but as more importantly service benefits in terms of the reactions to those. So I'm guessing, Mike, that given what's out there, the 2020 will continue to be a year where everything's on the table. We're going to kind of look at the multitude of those levers, and we're going to kind of go pull at those as we see fit. But at the same time, not sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages in the US and around the world. The only thing I'd add to that is – so if you think about technology and its benefits and how they manifest themselves, one, as it relates to the offerings that we're able to create for our clients, so our ability to create solutions around our clients' problems, you think about TTS as a good example. And as we deal with clients, and for example they try to match invoices with payments, we've been able to use technology in partnership with companies like HighRadius to create capabilities around that. So technology helps with our offerings. Technology helps with the client experience, as Mike suggested, in terms of the lower cost to serve but also improving the way and the experience that our clients have with us. And then finally, technology helps with the efficiency of how we run our operations, so expanding our cloud infrastructure, removing legacy data centers and physical servers, using automation, for example. So a number of different buckets are impacted by the technology spend that we make, and we'll continue to make that spend in light of those benefits. And then just one follow-up. As it relates to – I know John asked the question about your ROTCE target. I mean, I guess I'll ask – I'll make it easier and harder for you. I guess the easier thing is, look, under you, Mike Corbat, the ROTCE really has gone up quite a bit, 7%, 8%, up to 12% over a few years. So that's tremendous progress. But you still lag to peers. And I don't think consensus expects you to get your 13.5% target. I think you're kind of – what I'm hearing you say today is everything's on the table, but let's look at it in light of the new environment. So assume it might not be 13.5%. So I guess we'll have to wait for the fourth quarter unless you want to confirm that now. But, look, as long as it's getting better, you're moving in the right direction. That's good. I guess what irks me though is this year's target of 12%, when you say we'll get darn close – and I know you're competitive. Both of you are. Your whole firm's competitive. But to be darn close, I mean let's just get the target. Everything that you can possibly do. Everyone at the firm should know that 12% ROTCE is what you're striving for. It's just that sense of intensity. Even if you have it internally, it's just I'm not feeling it on this side of the perspective. So, if you could just give us a sense of the degree of that intensity. And I guess lastly, I mean two years ago you said our restructuring is over. So if you have a worst in class ROTCE versus your US peers, the issue is management or model. So it's either management intensity needs to pick up or maybe you need to retract the statement that a restructuring is over and take a new fresh look. So that's my last question. Okay. So what I would say, Mike, is that you're right. Mark and I are competitive. We are intense people. The firm is completely focused on this. But just like last year's fourth quarter, when I know you were disappointed, what I don't want to commit to is in some environment having to do things that don't make sense for the long-term. As an example, could we have cut and slashed and gotten our way last year to our efficiency target? Yes, we could have. In light of the rebound we saw this year, would those have been the right decisions? I don't believe that at all to be the case. And so we are committed to the 12% within the realm of what makes sense for our firm and in particular for our shareholders over the intermediate to longer term. And I think you've seen again this quarter we're pulling every lever we need to get there, but we're trying to do it smart. And you have my commitment, Mark's commitment, we're going to continue to do that, to do everything we can to deliver that 12%. I completely agree with that. And I guess the one thing I'd add just to highlight a point is that we're obviously trying to run this firm for its long-term sustainability and for the shareholder value that we can create. And that means making the smart decisions through the quarter around how we spend money and around how we evolve that model. So what I mean by that is if you think about what we talked about in the way of capacity adjustments that we'd had to make and the repositioning around that, those are increased expenses that we're having to take in the quarter and through the year. A short-minded view of that would be that that is against the 12% target that we're trying to deliver. When you're trying to run a firm for the long-term sustainability, you take those decisions because they are the right decisions to do, and you realize that over time they will pay dividends and benefits to the franchise. And so, yes. Without a doubt, 12% is our target. People know that up and down this firm. But we're going to run the firm responsibly. So hopefully that makes sense, Mike. Yes. All right. Thank you. Saul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi. Hi, everybody. This is Saul Martinez. So wanted to also ask about 2020. I realize there's a high level of uncertainty in the macro outlook. You're going through your budgeting process currently. But given what you know about your current rate sensitivity, what the forward curve is telling you right now, where long rates are at, what you're seeing in the economy, how confident are you that some revenue is still the base case for 2020 – some revenue growth target is still the base case for next year? Yeah. Saul, thank you. Like you said, we're pulling that together as part of the budget process. We do know, as you've suggested, that there will be a full year impact to the rate reductions that we've seen thus far through the year and any additional rate reductions that we see in the balance of the year, and so that's going to be a headwind that we've got to face off. That said, there is certainty around that direction that we've seen play out. There's been FX volatility through the year that has caused a market reaction in terms of that volatility generating client activity, and I bring that up because there are puts and takes that play out across our businesses as the market evolves. And there's still uncertainty around trade and how much progress we continue to make through the year on that topic. There's still uncertainty around Brexit and what happens there. And so as those things get hopefully finalized or additional decisions get made, those will be factors that we've got to consider as we look at 2020 and pull that plan together and before we're able to speak to what that target is from an ROTCE point of view or what levers we can pull to get to that target. And so it is still in progress, I guess, is how I'd have to respond to that, Saul. Okay. No. I get that. And I wasn't so much asking specifically about ROTCE... Yeah. ...but just the top line and whether the degree of confidence that there could actually be some growth, because that would – that obviously in this environment the fact that you are less rate sensitive than a lot of your peers does differentiate you. Yeah. But okay... And I do – I mean, I do – We do expect to see continued growth in our Cards business. We do expect to see continued growth in our Global Consumer franchise. So as we reference kind of those core components to the franchise, if you will, and to our network businesses, we do expect continued momentum there. But we do have to factor in some of these headwinds and unknowns. Got it. Let me change gears a little bit and ask you about CECL, and not the day one impact. I know you guys for some time have given the estimated day one impact of CECL in a range there. But how should we think about the day two impact on loan loss provisioning going forward? Credit losses are credit losses, over the life of the loan they will be the same regardless of the accounting framework. But there are lot of puts and takes. Your starting point  ALLL (00:46:56) ratio will be higher, but given level of charge-offs will mean more provisioning, and mix plays an important role. And it seems like you are growing in higher loss content lending in the US, but have you thought about how CECL – in an environment where maybe things don't really deteriorate much, where we don't have a big change in the macro backdrop, where it's more of the same, how CECL impacts your ongoing level of provisioning going forward? And so just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that. Yeah. So we haven't given any guidance on day two, as you've said. Obviously the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be. We obviously have a mix of both consumer loans and corporate loans, and so all of those factors will come in to play. I guess what I would say is as we've thought about our forecast and we've factored in what the longer term impact would be of CECL, but we haven't given any particular guidance. And I can't really speak to it anymore specifically than that. Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Yes. Thank you. Operator, who's next? Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven, your line is open. Thanks very much. So I wanted to start off with a question on NII. Mark, I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that pressured the Markets related NII specifically. As I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding costs were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability sensitive trading book. And with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down. And I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side, why the book isn't acting a little more liability sensitive. And should we see any funding benefit over time as the Fed continues easing? Yes, so, I think – look, I think it's – if you turn to page, that page 11 kind of highlighted the mix that – the dynamic that you're referencing and that I spoke to, which is that we're obviously seeing lower NIR from our Markets business. That's being completely offset in Markets non-NIR. And while you're right that we have talked about funding cost and its impact, and there is a funding cost benefit that plays through as rates come down, the dynamic around the Markets revenues is overshadowing that, if you will. So this mix impact is more significant than the funding cost benefit that we're seeing. So an example of this, the first thing I'd say is that, as you would imagine, we manage our Markets business not for NIR and non-NIR but for total revenues. And so that composition and that mix can and has varied. The NIR component is a function of the client demand and how traders manage the risk and fund positions. And so that is essentially what we're seeing play out here. So one example of that is we could be long an asset that generates interest revenue, long for example because we have inventory in place to facilitate that client activity. We could hedge that position with a derivative, and that impact of that hedge would hit non-NIR in principle transactions. And so it's that type of positioning that is impacting the mix, and this mix is overshadowing the funding cost benefit. Got it. But I guess taking – even taking a more holistic view, looking at principal transactions plus NII as the key trading proxy, it sounds like you should still see some benefit on the funding side over time as rates do come down. But the geography I think will be different. The geography may be different. Again, We are seeing a funding benefit. It's just being overshadowed. Got it. Okay. And just one more follow-up for me. On the Retail Bank strategy, you highlight some of the progress, growing deposits through the legacy card channel and digital sales. You also alluded to the possibility of maybe forging new partnerships to build further scale. And I was hoping you could speak to maybe what some of those partnerships might look like. And then just bigger picture as you think about the need to add scale to the US Retail franchise, whether it might make more sense to grow inorganically. And is that even a viable option given your current size or the current share of industry liabilities that you currently retain? Sure. I'm not on this call going to speak to specific names, but in the not-too-distant future you will see us coming out, and you know our portfolio of world class partners in our co-brands and in our Retail Services business. And we've been working with a number of them on new value propositions around those offerings, again very similar to the ways that we've rolled out our own proprietary products. And so in the not-too-distant future you'll hear more coming on that. And then bigger picture, just the Retail Bank strategy and appetite to maybe grow inorganically? It depends your definition of inorganic. And so again, if we continue to find as an example portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns, wide open to it. In terms of being out there buying a national consumer bank, I don't see that today, but – in particular given where some valuations are and I think given what's at stake on the digital side of things. But again, never dismissive. But we've very focused on the things that we can do organically, our investment in digital. And again I think you've seen what we've done there in terms of on the Consumer side, the Institutional side, using that digital strategy to not just reinforce but continue to grow our franchise. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika, please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Just a few follow-up questions. On Chubak's questions with regard to net interest revenue, could you remind us on – clearly, there's been a lot of volatility in terms of yield curve expectations. And could you remind us in terms of how your balance sheet is positioned today what the sensitivity is to 25 basis points of rate cuts? Sure. So we've talked about this in the past in terms of if you look at the IRE that we have in our 10-Qs, for the third quarter you'll see that that won't have materially changed. So the simple math is that a 25-basis point cut would result in a reduction of $50 million. Now, that is the simple math. And the impact is, in fact, greater than what that math would imply, and it's greater because the IRE analysis is based on a parallel shift. And we've certainly seen flattening of the curve, as well as the pace of the cuts is faster and the impact on deposit pricing sensitivity obviously is an important factor. So we've got a curve that's flatter and lower than expected, and the impact of the future cuts will kind of depend on the pace and the shape of the curve and the competitive environment. So those are all factors that influence that simple math, but the simple math has not changed. Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up to Glenn's question earlier, year-over-year growth in Branded Card revenues of 11%. You noted, Mark, that you're sort of at the right shift in terms of the mix in that portfolio. And as we think about 2020, should growth in Branded Cards revenue more reflect the sort of mid-single digit loan growth that you've been showing? Yes. We would expect that volume at that pace would be the major driver. There may still be a little bit of spread, but it will be mostly volume at the pace you've seen taking off at this stage or picking up at this stage. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt, please go ahead. Good morning. Good morning. You're obviously one of the most global banks, and given all the trade uncertainty there's naturally the perception that you're impacted by all this more than others. And I was wondering, one, if you could just talk about that in terms of what areas you think it is maybe dragging down some of the business. And then, two, I think in the past you've talked about there's some puts and takes. So if you do less trade with one country, there's some offsets in some others. So just try to elaborate on some of those factors. Thanks. Sure. Sure. I think that without a doubt, and this was reinforced, Matt a few weeks ago when I was in China, that in certain economies around the world, tariffs, trade tensions have certainly impacted trade. It's impacted it in two ways. One, from a volume perspective I think we see less trade and movement today. And I think the second way which you alluded to is that that we've also seen the rerouting of trade. And the example we give is, today China is not necessarily consuming less soy, it's just getting its soy from different places in the world. And so I think our ability as a global bank to move with our clients on both sides in terms of the importer and the exporter and to be helping them rethink what those trade routes and what that supply chain looks like, I think we've been very effective at. And I think the other piece that I don't think any of us can escape is that at least for right now with some of these uncertainties it has caused a slowdown in terms of trade. I think our business has shown a good resiliency, and again our trade is included as part of our TTS numbers. But to Mark's earlier point, if we can start to get some clarity on some of these things where I think businesses can have a little bit more surety in terms of the future, I think our trade business would definitely benefit from that. And do you think – so obviously it's going to be a directional negative, I think, on the revenue in the near term here, but do you think it kind of increases the relationship you have with all your global corporates, right, because you're one of the few banks out there that can shift some of the trade mix, and this lets you kind of flex maybe more of your muscles if trade wasn't so complicated? I think that's right. Our ability to be in the room on not just trade but more broadly defined supply chain management and really what that means in terms of a lot of companies today that operate in kind of just in time inventory is critical. And as examples, what we've seen out of the China mix is trade routes with Vietnam and India being a couple of the beneficiaries of that. And I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means has us pretty well positioned out there, and it's something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and is part of. And I think we're uniquely positioned to be part of that dialogue, just given the globality and our presence in 98 countries, et cetera, so. Great. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy, please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Betsy. Couple of questions. One, just wanted to understand how you're thinking about G-SIBs  or it's sort of (01:00:07) size, because I think you're a little above where you were in December. Does that matter to you? Not sure if it does. Sure. So we are obviously – in December, we were at a 3%. We are targeting being at a 3% again for 2019. Where we're at in that bucket does matter as it has capital implications if you think about how it fits into our TCE requirements. So it absolutely matters, and we're targeting being at a 3% by the end of the year. Is there anything in particular that you have to do to get there? Or is it just normal course? Well, I mean, obviously we'll look at client demand that we have. We'll look at returns for the use of the balance sheet that we have. And our primary objective obviously would be to meet client demand where we can grow and do so with returns that make sense for the franchise. And so that's kind of a primary objective. We think we can do that through the balance of this year and deliver as a 3% G-SIB bank. If we start to see in the future growth that takes us beyond that, we want to be thoughtful and responsible about how we capture that and ensure that we're getting the commensurate returns that make sense. But we're actively managing how we're using the balance sheet, how we're engaged with our clients. And where it makes sense to put on higher returning assets, we're doing so. And where it makes sense to reduce those that are lower returning, we're doing so. And it's that dynamic that we'll manage to, to get to where we need to be for the end of the year. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mark. So Mike, question just on the Consumer business in a little bit broader. You're a nationwide business in card and you are a little bit more targeted, right? You used to be nationwide in mortgage, but now you're more targeted around your customer set. I know you're looking to move into different geographies via the deposit, and you've got some wealth. And I'm just trying to understand how you think about that, that footprint and that collection of businesses. And is – maybe you could give us – help us understand the strategic angle, and where you're taking the US business, where you want to take the US business over the next, say, three years or so. Sure. Does deposit lead first into new geographies, and then you fill in with other products? Or is – Maybe you can loop in some of the inorganic discussion that you had before. I would say today it is primarily organic and it is fundamentally technology driven. So using some of the things you cited, Betsy. So, one, today from a physical presence, we've got six large presences across the United States. But as you reference, we've got truly a national cards franchise. And depending whether you cut the line at our priority network or you go to some of our co-brand and retail partners, we're touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States, virtually in every state. And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers, in some of the experimenting we've been doing on the deposit side, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter but really year-to-date two-thirds of those brought in outside of the six markets. Of those deposits that were brought in, over 50% of those deposits were brought in by people who do not have the relationship, the deposits relationship with the bank. And so I think our ability to continue to build on that and be smart around the advantage we have, and that is we know these people. When you think about proprietary perspective, when you think about the length of some of our co-brand relationships and what we know, we know where you live. We know what you spend. We know how much you earn. And by the way, we know who your bank is. And we can be targeting people around that. So we think there's a real opportunity. In many ways we think it's very much a unique opportunity because there's really no bank out there that has the same national presence that we have from our cards portfolio. So again, not just from a proprietary perspective but how do we engage with our partners and how do we create the right value propositions in each direction. And I think we've got a good plan against that, and you're going to be seeing more of that in the not-too-distant future. Okay, because it does feel like great brand value, maybe a little under-levered in the revenue line here. And so I'm just wondering, do you build on that with incremental products, like mortgage across these different geographies, kind of going back to where you were pre-crisis where you were much more nationwide and a much broader set of products? And again, I wouldn't rule out – and we've been asked, Betsy. I wouldn't rule out branch openings and changing that number from six to something higher, but first it's going to come through digital engagement. And from that digital engagement, you'll likely see us start or build on that relationship off of the card to a deposit relationship. And then like most people that are in the digital space, you continue to add on to that. And so for us, let's make sure the value proposition works. I think we're seeing that. Let's build on that. And then as we have success, open to building more branches in areas where that makes sense, and certainly open to adding more products. All right. Thanks, Mike. Okay and your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty, please go ahead. Thanks. I have two questions. One is when you looked at the – going back to the financial markets kind of NII number, isn't it also that the inversion of the yield curve when long rates come down, the assets that are in the inventory are tied to the longer part of the curve and the funding is tied to the shorter end of the curve, so the inversion really does have a pretty meaningful impact on your net interest revenue in that particular segment? And that also makes a difference because as the Fed catches up with the long end of the curve, that part of your NII can actually see a benefit going forward which will be different than what you'll see in a normal kind of retail bank? There's some impact there, but I think less so relative to the mix dynamic that I was describing. So – but you're right. There is some impact that flows through because of that dynamic. Okay. And then kind of looking at the bigger picture, in other words, being on your side and having to hit a target. And you have to put a target, and yet when you say the word target it is a target, right? It's the direction you're going in, which I think is much more important than if I'm 11.9% or 12.1%. It's the direction of improvement that you're kind of continuing to be able to go through that path. And if you look at this and look at this particular story and investment, creating a tangible book value is a big piece of what – I think we hadn't talked about is the tangible book value was up 12% over the last year. So if your tangible book value is growing double digits, you've got a 3% dividend, and I'd love to know your opinion on whether or not that's defensible through the downturn in the cycle. But I think we set up CCAR to make it defensible. So if you have a sustainable dividend, you're growing your tangible book value, and you're progressing and returns is on the upward trend, then I think trading at tangible book value is a pretty good bargain. So just wanted to kind of think about those three avenues or those metrics. Sure. So, Mark, why don't we tag team? So one, Marty, I would say from a dividend perspective, when you look at that roughly 3% dividend yield, $2.04 a share, a little over 2 billion shares outstanding, so somewhere slightly north of $4 billion on a net income base in the high-teens. So I think clear sustainability of dividend, and in any reasonable environment I think ample headroom to continue to take that up. The other piece obviously is the flexibility we have in terms of buyback and the amount that we have there, and we've talked about the components of the combination of earnings, of goodwill, intangible, DTA type usage in there that gives us a bit more capacity. And so again, I think ample flexibility. And as you've said in here, it's not just hitting any particular target but in the round. And obviously our primary focus here, which I think we've tried to use other things as proxies for, is to – some of the earlier conversations is continuing to on both an absolute and relative basis continue to grow our return on tangible common equity. So continue to take that up in any reasonable environment and also continue to close the gap to peers as part of that. I think that's spot-on, Mike. The only thing I'd add to your point around continued progress is you can look back to 2018 and we had a target of a 10.5% ROTCE. We were able to deliver on the 10.9%. We've talked about a 12% for this year. We're on track here to-date to do that. We've talked about returning capital over the three CCAR cycles at $60 billion-plus. We're at $60 billion-plus. And so we are continually trying to demonstrate progress on those very important metrics, not the least of which is this ROTCE, and we plan to continue to do so. Yeah. And I think the progress and sustainability are the two key words that you talked about there. Continued progress and sustainability of what you've already achieved  with (01:10:27) any reasonable outcome is the things that I just wanted to confirm. So thanks. Agree. Agree. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, please go ahead. Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick ones. It was good to see the overall deposit costs start to turn down this quarter. Can you just talk about deposit strategies from here? And how you'd expect the betas to act especially since you are still putting out that national rate? How are you trying to match off against the lower rate side on the asset side with the deposit cost? Thanks. Yes. So our Consumer deposits, while we did get growth in volume there, we did see pressure from a spread point of view. Keep in mind, our US Consumer deposit is about $150 billion, and the betas are generally low as it relates to those Consumer deposits. And so as – we're not – as we saw the rate environment increasing a year or so ago, we didn't see the benefits of that. And so similarly – we didn't see the impact of that and so similarly as we see rate cuts play out, we're not going to see that play through either. And so we kind of low betas on the Consumer side likely to continue there. As it relates to pricing, for the high yield savings accounts for example which has been part of our growth strategy, just part, we have adjusted pricing for those and for money market accounts. And we've been doing that over the past quarter or so as we've seen interest rates come down, and you should expect that we'll continue to do that to be aligned with the market. Okay. And a follow-up on the capital side. So you're 11.6% on CET1, you'd talk about it 11.5% year-end. Rates have obviously been a helper, and the capital return continues underneath. Can you talk about just like what happens post 2019 in terms of your willingness to let the CET ratio continue to come down in the context of still seeing a big capital return number and given what the outlook is for earnings underneath? Thanks. Sure. So you're right. We did see kind of CET1 come down from second quarter to third quarter. We also saw that last year as well, second to third quarter, as we start to execute on the capital return that's approved as part of the CCAR cycle. There's somewhat of a natural dip there. But there's also the planning that we've talked to around getting down to what we thought – what we think is a prudent level of capital hold, which is about 11.5%. So we are in line, I would say, with our expectations to be roughly at 11.5% by the end of the year. You'll recall that that 11.5% has a management buffer in it. That buffer is meant to account for some of the uncertainty and volatility and some of the proposals that are still outstanding that could have an impact on capital requirements. But at this stage without complete clarity on how some of those things change, we feel like 11.5% is still the prudent level at which to run the firm. That means in going into 2020, we will first have to think about client demand and growth juxtapose against what we're able to generate in the way of net income that would be available to common shareholders and the DTA that we're able to reduce. And based on that reduction of a disallowed DTA, we will be able to determine how much capital we can in fact return to shareholders. And so that's how we'll think about capital return going forward. But the CET1 target at this stage remains at the 11.6% level. Thanks a lot, Mark. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian, please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, I just had two quick questions on expenses here. It sounded like in Mexico you were kind of managing the efficiency ratio and trying to get that lower. I mean, does that mean you've officially decided not to do that last piece of investment? I think you outlined it was $500 million opportunity to pull back on. Yeah, so we – you're right. We have been managing Mexico very thoughtfully and trying to ensure that we continue to demonstrate EBIT growth there in light of the environment that's there and softer revenues that we've been seeing. The expense management that we're seeing there is in part a by-product of the investments that we made in the prior year, and so some of those investments were in building out the efficiencies around our operations. And so we're starting to see some of those cost saves play out in 2019, and so that is a good thing. We obviously will look at the balance of the investments that are to be made as part of our Mexico strategy and determine how we want to prioritize those and how we want to pace those in light of the environment that we're in. But the cost savings that we're seeing at this stage are really a by-product of the return on the early investments we made to improve productivity and thoughtful pacing around what's left. And then just a separate one on – you mentioned that there's a continuing investment in controls and risk in Corporate/Other. Are you close to a point where you've reached a peak on that, and we should expect that to trend down over time? Or is it still something that's increasing? Thanks. Sure. We actually do expect – I think I mentioned the outlook for Corporate/Other being slightly higher going into the fourth quarter as a result of continued infrastructure cost. We think that's important to make as a franchise. That includes things like enhancing our data capabilities. It includes things like cybersecurity capabilities, improving our compliance in risk and finance infrastructure. So all of those things we think are critical to not only running a safe and sound organization but in many ways helping to drive better business operations as well. And so, yes, we expect to continue to make investments in that area. And I would say, Mark, that in all of that we – it's not just the investment into safety and soundness, but there's paybacks in the round on that in terms of being able to replace manual processes and other things. Absolutely. Between the automation opportunities out of there, the straight-through processing opportunities that are there, that's what I was alluding to when I said the opportunity to improve business operations. So it's safety and soundness and those efficiencies that we'll get as an organization. So they are investments, in fact, in many instances and do have paybacks associated with them. Okay. Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard, please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike. Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Can you guys share with us – you identified that you had some strong performance in M&A this quarter, particularly in EMEA. Was it due to hiring people that you're having the success in M&A? Or is it taking market share from some of the competitors, particularly over in Europe, some of them are struggling? I think it's both. I think when you go back and look this isn't just a third quarter of 2019 phenomenon, but I think something we've spoken to. And I think you've seen over the last three or four years, some pretty consistent market share gains for us there. And it hasn't just been EMEA, but EMEA I think has been one of the top performers for us. And so I think it's really been both client engagement, but also as you know in the business of making sure you have the right people in the right seats. And again, as you've seen publicly, we've been making those investments. Yeah. We've seen increases in – when you think about share in technology, in healthcare, in Consumer, and so we've seen it across a number of sectors. As Mike says, it's a by-product of having made those investments and being positioned to serve our clients well. And then in the Markets business, obviously we've all seen on the retail side that the trading commissions have been dropped to zero in many of the discount brokers like the Charles Schwab or Fidelity. In cash equities in the Institutional business, we all know that the cents per trade has steadily declined, electronic trading has reduced revenues. Is there a day that we're actually going to see zero commissions possibly in cash equities following the retail side? We could. We could. I don't think we're right there, but again I think a lot of it in my mind will have to do with information and our ability to use that information and how GDPR rolls out in the US more broadly and what we're actually permitted to do with that information. I think that's a topic for another day, but I think that you could theoretically see certain people willing to pay for that information. I think point two is that when you actually look at with the indexation, the other thing that's going on is that the economics in terms of derivatives, the economics in terms of prime brokerage, the economics in terms of custody and clearing, all areas that we've been heavily investing in. So to the extent that the cash equity trade underlies several of those activities supported by pre-trade around research and other pieces, I think there's more to play out in that as well. Very good. And then just lastly, you talked about the success of gathering deposits digitally. I may have missed this, and you pointed to your high yield savings account. With those deposit customers, are you doing it with the high yield savings account or is there a cash bonus? If they open up the account online, they get an extra $100 or something like that? So first of all, we're growing the deposits more broadly than just the high yield savings account and frankly more broadly than just the digital. We're growing through traditional channels as well. We do have growth in the high yield savings accounts specifically too, and that is through an offer of higher rate. But that said, what you also heard us reference was creating value propositions as well as incentives for clients to open deposit accounts with us, i.e., offering ThankYou Points, offering double cash back, those types of incentives that are aligned with the card as incentive for those customers to open a Retail Banking account with us, in this case online or digitally. Okay. So you're not sending them toasters though, right? We're not. We're not. We're out of the toaster sending business at this stage. All right. Thank you. Your final question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And Vivek, your line is open. Please go ahead. Yeah, we are not getting a response from Vivek Juneja. He may be asking his question elsewhere, operator. So with that, Liz, back to you. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to us in Investor Relations, and have a good day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you again for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning and welcome to the Mercantile Bank Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Houston of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Iris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Mercantile Bank Corporation's conference call and webcast to discuss the company's financial results for the third quarter 2019. I'm Mike Houston with Lambert IR, Mercantile's Investor Relations firm. And joining me today are members of their management team, including Bob Kaminski, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Christmas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Reitsma, President of Mercantile Bank of Michigan. We'll begin the call with management's prepared remarks and then open the call up to questions. However, before we begin today's call, it is my responsibility to inform you this call may involve certain forward-looking statements such as projections of revenue, earnings and capital structure, as well as statements on the plans and objectives of the company's business. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today due to the factors described in the company's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. If anyone does not already have a copy of the press release issued by Mercantile today, you can access it at the company's website, www.mercbank.com. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mercantile's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Kaminski. Bob? Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. On the call, we will provide an update on our overall performance and financial results along with our key areas of strategic focus. At the conclusion of our comments, we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session. We are pleased to again deliver solid operating results for the third quarter, continuing our year-to-date strength. The bank's sound financial condition, accelerating commercial and residential mortgage loan originations and solid loan pipelines give us confidence that the healthy results achieved during the first nine months of the year will provide the foundation for continued strong performance through the rest of 2019 and in future periods. The third quarter operating performance includes growth in net interest income resulting primarily from a higher level of earning assets. Interest margin remained solid despite rate reductions by the FOMC, reflecting our ongoing emphasis on loan pricing discipline and sound underwriting. Chuck will discuss the margin in more detail later. Our team's emphasis on building and cultivating value-added relationships continues to successfully attract new customers as well as retain existing clients. Increased noninterest income also led to improved earnings for the quarter. The increase in mortgage banking activity fees was primarily driven by the ongoing success of strategic initiatives that were put in place several quarters ago. Mortgage banking results were also boosted by an increase in mortgage refinance activity in a higher percentage of our loan production being sold. Growth of mortgage banking income through expanded market share remains a priority for our company. Our strong team of mortgage bankers coupled with our wide range of products and services allows us to continue to build deep and meaningful client relationships throughout our markets. Regarding noninterest expense, we remain pleased with our work of – with the work of our senior leadership and the entire team to diligently monitor and control overhead costs. Our objective is to be an efficiently operating company, while at the same time making the appropriate investments to ensure we are meeting our customers' needs and exceeding their expectations and building a highly sustainable organization for the years to come. Turning to the Michigan economy, trends remain steady as employment in our primary markets continue to be strong and real estate conditions remain healthy. We will continue to monitor these indicators closely for any possible shifts in these trends. The ongoing cash dividend program including the announcement of our fourth quarter regular dividend today exhibits our commitment to enhancing total shareholder return. During the quarter, we also resumed share repurchases under our program. Mercantile repurchased approximately 112,000 shares for $3.5 million or a weighted average all-in cost per share of $31.36 during the third quarter 2019. Mercantile is well positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunities, reflecting the excellent work of the Mercantile team in all of our markets. Our steady core profitability, strong capital position and the healthy loan pipelines will serve us well for the balance of the year and beyond. Although we operate in a potentially volatile interest rate environment, as always, we will continue to monitor both micro and macroeconomic activity, and our focus remains on creating and leveraging opportunities, whatever the economic climate. We are excited about our ability to expand in our markets and continually improve in both the near-term and long-term. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Ray. Thanks, Bob. We are pleased to report loan growth during the third quarter which represents a 7% annualized growth rate. New commercial term loan originations remained strong during the quarter, representing the highest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2016. Approximately $153 million and $412 million in commercial term loans to new and existing borrowers were originated during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2019 respectively, as our lending team continues its focus on identifying new customer relationships and meeting the needs of our existing customer base. Our pipeline remains solid as well with $91 million of commitments in commercial construction and development loans, which we expect to fund over the next 12 to 18 months. Our asset quality is sterling, as nonperforming assets declined to $2.9 million or less than 0.1% total assets at September 30. We recorded noninterest income during the third quarter of $6.7 million, up $2 million or nearly 42% from the prior year third quarter. This improved level of noninterest income was largely driven by increased mortgage banking  (00:07:25), reflecting the success of ongoing strategic initiatives designed to increase market share, a higher level of refinance activity stemming from a recent decrease in rates and an increased percentage of loans sold. Continuing to enhance mortgage banking income through increased market share including an increased share in the purchase market remains a priority, and we will continue to hire proven mortgage loan originators as we are able. We also recorded continued growth during the quarter in other fee income categories including credit and debit card income, service charges on accounts, and payroll processing fees. We exercise discipline related to overhead costs as we focused on efficient delivery systems, and all of our lines of business remains a priority. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Thank you, Ray. Good morning to everybody. This morning, we announced net income of $12.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to the third quarter of 2018 net income of $10.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Net income for the first nine months of 2019 totaled $36.1 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.5 million, or $1.83 per diluted share during the first nine months of 2018. Bank owned life insurance claims and a gain on the sale of a former branch facility increased net income during the first nine months of 2019 by approximately $3.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Interest income related to purchased loan accounting entries increased net income during the first nine months of 2019 by $0.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and net income during the first nine months of 2018 by $2.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of these transactions, diluted earnings per share increased $0.29, or over 17% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the respective 2018 period. We remain pleased with our financial condition and earnings performance, and believe we are very well positioned to continue to take advantage of lending and market opportunities, while delivering consistent results for our shareholders. Our net interest margin was 3.71% during the third quarter compared to 3.79% during the second quarter of 2019. The decline in large part reflects the FOMC's decision to lower the fed – federal funds rate by 25 basis points on July 31, along with another 25 basis points in mid-September. About 53% of our commercial loans or approximately 36% of our total assets are tied to either the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or the 30-day LIBOR rate. As a result, our yield on loans declined 12 basis points when comparing the third and the second quarters. Our cost of funds as a percent of average earning assets declined 4 basis points during the third quarter when compared to the second quarter, a large part reflecting a reduction in our money market deposit account rate offerings in association with the FOMC's rate decisions. We have also lowered rates on time deposit accounts; however, the impact of those rate cuts will be lagged as those deposits will not re-price until maturity date. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect our net interest margin to be in a range of 3.50% to 3.55%, with the lower end of the range reflecting the assumption of an additional 25-basis-point rate cut, as this is currently widely expected by the markets on October 30. Assuming no further FOMC rate reductions, we do not expect our net interest margin to – or we do expect our net interest margin to improve throughout 2020, as fixed rate time deposits and FHLB advances mature and can be re-priced or placed at lower rates. For example, we have $80 million in brokered time deposits that mature between December and July, which we currently expect to experience a rate reduction of about a 100 basis points as these funds mature and are replaced. The reduction of excess liquidity consisting of funds and deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago over the next several months will provide further support toward net interest margin. We quoted $0.3 million in purchased loan accretion payments received in CRE-pooled loans during the third quarter of 2019. Based on our most recent valuations in cash flow forecast on purchased loans, we expect to record additional interest income totaling $0.2 million for the fourth quarter. Also, we expect to receive in aggregate about $1.5 million in principle payments and purchase-impaired CRE-pooled loans over the next several years which will be recorded as interest income upon receipt. The overall quality of our loan portfolio remains very strong with continued low levels of non-performing assets and loan charge-offs. Non-performing assets as a percent of total assets equaled only 8 basis points at the end of the third quarter. Loan charge-offs totaled $0.5 million during the third quarter and totaled less than $0.8 million for the first nine months of 2019. We recorded net loan charge-offs of $0.3 million during the third quarter and $0.4 million during the first nine months of 2019, equating to only 5 basis points and 2 basis points of average total loans respectively. Provision expense for the third quarter totaled $0.7 million, in large part reflecting commercial loan growth. We expect to record provision expense in the range of $0.5 million to $1.0 million during the fourth quarter. Our loan loss reserve totaled $24.4 million at the end of the third quarter, or 0.88% of total originated loans. This coverage ratio has remained steady for many quarters and no significant changes are expected during the remainder of 2019. With regards to CECL, we have completed our initial framework and we'll continue to be working to fine-tune that framework and the assumptions during the remainder of 2019. We previously provided color on our fee income performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. I will add that we expect non-interest income to be in the range of $5.6 million to $6.0 million during the fourth quarter. We recorded non-interest expense of $22.0 million during the third quarter of 2019, up $0.4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2018. We recorded a higher level of salary and benefits expense, mainly reflecting employee merit pay increases, mortgage lender commissions and higher stock-based compensation expense. However, our FDIC insurance expense was down $0.5 million, reflecting deposit insurance credits. Currently, we expect non-interest expense to total in a range of $22.0 million to $22.5 million during the fourth quarter, with our effective tax rate remaining near 19%. Total deposits increased $303 million during the first nine months of 2019, comprised of $263 million growth in local deposits and a $40 million increase in brokered deposits. The increase in local deposits primarily reflects growth in business checking account balances associated with new C&I lending relationships and a time deposit campaign earlier in the year. In addition, during the third quarter, we experienced seasonal deposit growth for many of our municipal deposit customers. As of the end of the third quarter, wholesale funds comprised 16% of total funds, unchanged to a level as of year-end 2018. We remain a well-capitalized banking organization. As of September 30, 2019, our Bank's total risk-based capital ratio is 12.5% and in dollars was approximately $84 million higher than the 10% minimum required to be categorized as well-capitalized. As Bob mentioned, we were active in buying back our stock during the third quarter. For all of 2019, we have repurchased about 231,000 shares at a weighted average cost of $30.76 per share for a total cost of $7.1 million. We currently have approximately $16.5 million available in our current buyback plan. Those are my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob. Thank you. Thank you, Chuck. That concludes management's prepared remarks. We'll now open the call up to a Q&A. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Kevin Reevey with D. A. Davidson. Good morning. (00:17:04) How are you? (00:17:05) Pretty good. So, first question is related to your commercial loan book, what percentage of the variable rate portion of your commercial loan book contains floors, and if you can kind of talk about the amount of floors you're putting on, on new loans, if at all, and where those rates are? Yeah. Kevin, this is Chuck. It's not a high percentage of loans that have floors, we do have some, we have been over the last few years trying to negotiate some floors into our loan relationships and we've been successful. Those that we do, I would say, is – I still have a few more potential rate cuts before they come into play, but I can assure you that as the Fed has started to talk about lowering rates and has actually started talking about lower rates, we've been much more active in negotiating floors into our relationships. And as far as what other strategies, I know you talked about some of your brokered deposit – deposits come due. What are the strategies do you have in place to mitigate NIM pressure as far as lengthening the duration of your securities portfolio or what hedges? Yeah. I mean we're always looking at our balance sheet to help manage interest rate risk. We don't have – currently, we don't have any derivative instruments that we're involved in. Obviously, first and foremost, we look at the rates that we are offering on our deposit accounts. Like most banks out there, we didn't do much of anything on our savings and interest checking accounts, while rates were going up. So, there's not a lot of opportunities there. To lower rates, as I mentioned in my comments, we have been relatively aggressive in lowering rates on our money market accounts as we were relatively aggressive increasing those rates, as we saw our competition doing the same thing over last few years. We've also been relatively aggressive similar to money market rates on lowering our CD rates. Obviously, there's a lag there, but we do have obviously every month, every day, CDs that are maturing, with a vast majority of those we'll be re-pricing downwards. It's more of a timing issue. It is same with the wholesale funds. One of the things  that we were very big opponents (00:19:37) and kept to our standards while rates were going up was to, when we were engaged in wholesale funds, first to go relatively long, generally four to seven years as we were matching our fixed rate commercial loans, and certainly looking back now like, wow, we would have been in a better shape with our margin had we gotten shorter and had those rates, not only these lower when we got the advances but obviously available for refinancing at a much quicker pace. But hindsight being 2020, regardless, we still believe that that was the right thing to do. We were managing our interest rate risk for the long-term and get it putting that wholesale funding program into managing the interest rate risks associated with five-year fixed rate balloons, we think, was the right thing even today as we sit here and look at our net interest margin and over the next few quarters is going to get banged up a little bit from the rapid reduction that the Federal Reserve has put on all banks, obviously including ours. So it's more of a timing issue than anything else. One of things that we've been saying all along is that Mercantile for this composition of its balance sheet is not – has not really been on a core basis of 3.8%, 3.9% margin bank. We've always said that we're closer to a 3.6%, 3.7% bank. We were just taking advantage over the last several – couple of years of – taken advantage of the increasing interest rate environment, so we're giving that back a little bit over the next few quarters, as I mentioned probably around a 3.5% margin, but we do expect to start getting that back once the Fed is done lowering rates, and I think over time, perhaps by the end of next year, we'll be back to that core level. And so, it is more of a timing issue than anything else, but like all of our decisions here at Mercantile Bank, we are in it for a long haul and we're going to continue to manage our balance sheet not only for short-term gains or short-term increases in our net interest margins, but to maintain that margin at least at a core level over the long-term. Thanks for the color. And then, now I have one last question and I'll let someone jump in. The GM strike has been going on for about a month. Can you talk about what you're seeing as far as the impact of that to your customers and your markets? I think, Kevin, what we're seeing is that there is some softness that is manifesting itself because of what's going on with the auto situation with the GM strike. I think there has been some pockets of it, nothing that's systemic, but I think the longer it goes on, certainly a deeper the reflection might be of some impact of that, but nothing widespread or significant at this point in time, just some pockets of weakness. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks, Kevin. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW. Hey. Good morning, guys. How's it going today? Good, Damon, how are you? Great. Thanks. Just a kind of follow-up on Kevin's last question about the impact from the GM strike. How is that or has that at all kind of impacted your outlook for loan growth as we finish off 2019 and go into 2020? Yeah. I think if you look at what we're seeing, Damon, is as we often talk about, every year we have fundings on the loan side of in excess of $0.5 billion, and I think what you're going to see is that continuing for 2019 as well. I think as there are challenges in the aspects of the portfolio, that as always the case there's something going on somewhere in the portfolio and – but there's enough strength on a widespread basis in all segments of the portfolio that I think is not going to dampen our loan growth. I think the debt – the growth maybe as we talked about from time to time is as we did have some pay-outs, we've been very fortunate. Thus far in 2019, we haven't had those pay-outs, but anticipate certainly them being more prevalent in the fourth quarter. But, as we said on the funding side, we're always going to be consistent having sustained fundings of over $0.5 billion and we see that for this year as well. Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then, I'll try a question for Chuck here going back to the margin, so just to confirm you said that you thought the margin would be in the 3.50% to 3.55% range and that reflects one additional cut in the latter half of this year, is that correct? Yeah. I think the 3.50% reflects the cut later this month. But if we don't get that cut or it comes in December, we're probably on the higher side of that range. Okay. Are you guys internally forecasting any cuts in 2020? We're not quite there yet. We are just as we get here through the end of the third quarter we'll start working wholeheartedly on our budget. We do see that the market has priced one in for March, and so that is something that we'll take a look at to determine if we want to put that one in there. But at least right now, it doesn't appear that we'll get – hopefully if not get too many more in 2020, maybe just that one. But it seems like right now and looking at the market expectations is most of the declines will come here in the second half of 2019 and then we'll just build our margin back up to more of a core level throughout next year. Got it, okay. And then just lastly thoughts on the buyback, you have a bit of activity this quarter, do you think that will be a tool you guys will continue to use? Yeah. I mean, like I said we were just now starting to use our new plan that we've put in place in the spring that replaced our existing plan that was getting low on share availability, excuse me – we've been buying back in general recently anything under $32, well, I think we'll continue to be active if our price drops below that level again. Perhaps a little bit higher, obviously, we're looking that in conjunction with our cash dividend program, we're looking that in conjunction with our capital levels, and as we look at the various ratios that we use that take into account risk-based capital such as CRE concentrations. And so, it's a blend of all that,  but we definitely recognize the fact that our stock is trading very low on a multiple basis compared to where we've historically been, not just us, but the entire banking sector. We've got a very strong balance sheet, good earnings performance. There's always going to be some level of headwinds. We've got some level of excess capital to make sure we're prepared for that. But we do see an opportunity if our price does drop low to take advantage of that price and we definitely will. Got it. Okay, that's all that I had for now. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks, Damon. Our next question comes from John Rodis with Janney. Good morning, guys. Good morning, John. Hey, Chuck, just not to beat this to death, but back to the margin. (00:27:07). So, you're talking about roughly around 3%, 3.5% with another 25 basis points later this year and then some improvement next year if nothing else happens. But hypothetically, if the Fed were to cut 25 basis points later this month and then another one to two times later this year, early next year, do you think you could hold that 3.5% level instead of the modest improvement? That would be a difficult situation if they get – if they continue to be very aggressive. Certainly, as they continue to be very aggressive, we would see all the other yields fall as well if rates fall, and so those moneys that we have maturing both in local time deposits as well as brokered deposits and even some FHLB advances, they'd even reprice at a greater level. So, I can't put a number to it to speak of that. But I would think that the more aggressive the Fed is in future periods, the more difficult it's going to be  or at the (00:28:11) timing standpoint of us recovering to more of a core margin. So, I think it'd be more – one of more timing, but certainly it might impact the first and second quarter differently than what just one more cut or perhaps one in March would do. Yeah. That makes sense. (00:28:27). Just looking at the mortgage banking results, and obviously, they were strong. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, what do you sort of think is a more, I guess, normalized level of mortgage revenues if refi activity slow some? The second quarter was around $2.9 million in revenues. Second quarter – I'm sorry, third quarter was close to $2.9 million. Second quarter was like $1.3 million. Where do you think sort of a more normalized quarter is for mortgage given your build-out of the team? Yeah. John, that's going to be a really difficult one to predict. Certainly, on an overall trend basis as we've built that out and added additional lenders and we will continue to embark on doing more of that in future periods, there's just so much outside environmental factors that come into play. It's very difficult to put precise numbers on it, especially on a quarterly basis. Obviously, interest rates play a very significant role, especially in regards to refinance activity.  It does help (00:29:37) purchase activity, although I would say that maybe purchase activity is more based on the overall economic picture than maybe interest rates are. And we have seen some nice increases just not on the refis, but we've also seen some nice increases on the purchases. So, that gives me optimism for future periods as far as permanent growth, if you will, with that program. We've also – and Ray mentioned, we've been able to sell a higher percentage of the loans that we've been making  than in the past. I think on a (00:30:08) year-to-date basis, we've sold almost 70% of our originations, where historically it's been closer to 45%. So, that comes into play. Of course, here in Michigan especially, we have seasonality with the first quarter during the winter months. So, there's just so much that goes into it and it's really hard to put numbers to it. But I think I would – I'm pretty sure that I'm accurate in saying that we will continue to see overall growth. It's just a matter of what takes place with the rate environment and those other things that I mentioned. I'd also mention, when we get to that number that you've quoted, that does include the amortization of mortgage servicing rights, and certainly with the lower rates and the refinancing activity we've seen, we have had to increase the amortization of our mortgage servicing rights. So, if we did see a slowdown in mortgage income – mortgage activity, it's likely that the amortization would also lessen as well. So, obviously, it was the natural hedge in there to some degree. So, I don't want to be evasive to your answer, but it's really hard to put numbers exactly as to how the mortgage operation is going to do given the amount of environmental factors that we have to contend with. This is Bob, and I would add to that that we've been very intentional about the lenders that we've added to our mortgage area. These are lenders that are some veterans in our markets that have demonstrated the ability despite the environmental conditions and the things that naturally occur in the economy to develop loyal followings, where they've been able to have some strong production regardless of the economic conditions. Will it be as strong as it is at a time such as right now? No, probably not. But I think overall in terms of the ability of them to generate volume to come into the bank and new markets, new clients, new opportunities, because of the fact that they've joined our organization, gives us some encouragement and provides some good comfort that the mortgage banking activity will continue to be a growth area for us.  (00:32:17) continue to look to add commission mortgage lenders as the department continues to grow and gain a reputation with our clients and among the mortgage community. Okay. Hey, Chuck, just the MSR, what was the write-down this quarter? I'll have to give you that offline because I don't have that off the top of my head. Okay. Okay. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Cardenas with Raymond James. Hey, guys. Good morning. Good morning. Just – most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a couple quick questions here. In terms of your operating expenses, you guys have done a really great job of controlling those throughout 2019. As we look at 2020, is it safe to assume that maybe a low single-digit growth rate is reasonable? Yeah. Like I said – Dan, this is Chuck – we're kind of just starting to get into the midst of our budget preparations for 2020. But I would say probably a 2% increase probably off the second quarter is probably a good – second quarter of this year is probably a good base to look at, and maybe somewhere around 2% increase is what I would project it to be in and most of that being in the salary area with the merit increases and those types of things. Okay, great. And then, any color you can give us on day one impact from CECL. Yeah. As I mentioned, we're not at a point we want to give out specific numbers. We're still working through our framework with our auditor friends and making sure that we're comfortable with this brand-new model, and it's a whole different world of assumptions and economic environments and those types of things. I don't want to go too far off the edge here. But I think as we look at it in relation to what we're doing now, there is not a significant amount of base change, if you will. We're still using our grading systems. We're still looking at environmental adjustments, still looking at the same strong loan portfolio as we switch from one day to the other. So, it doesn't seem to us that at the end of the day switching to CECL is going to have a significant effect on our overall loss level – loan loss reserve level. But – I'll say that, but then I'll also say we continue to work through – we got our framework developed, and we just got to work through the assumptions in regards to that framework and things like environmental and stuffs, but it doesn't look like it's going to be significant at this point. Okay, great. Right. Thanks, guys. Good quarter. Thanks, Dan. Our next question is a follow-up from Kevin Reevey with D. A. Davidson. (00:35:17) Kevin here. Yeah. So, I was just curious about your – you've got a nice currency to do deals. So, I was just curious about your appetite for acquisitions and criteria and geographies and what you're hearing from sellers and then what their appetites are given where we are in the cycle? Yeah. I would answer that, Kevin, the same way we have on our recent quarters that our appetite hasn't changed. We remain interested certainly in opportunities that come along, and we have from time to time seen some opportunities cross our desk. But as we often talk about, culture is very, very important to us, and those types of things weigh very – very significantly on our assessment of M&A opportunities. So, it probably shrinks the universe compared to what it might be for other organizations. So, I think there's certainly lots of talk out there, lots of conversations. But I think from our standpoint, we're staying the course. We're looking at opportunities that come down the pike, and we're being very selective and opportunistic as any of those opportunities may continue down the road in future days. Great, thanks. That was helpful. Thanks, Kevin. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bob Kaminski for any closing remarks. Yeah. Thank you very much for your interest in our company. We look forward to speaking with you again in January, and this call has now been completed. Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker. Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our third quarter results. Our earnings included a number of significant items that John Shrewsberry will discuss, but I'll note at the outset that our underlying business fundamentals were strong. That strength was demonstrated by, among other things, increases in loan and deposit balances, both from the second quarter and from a year ago; our highest branch customer experience scores in over three years; and continued growth in primary consumer checking customers. As you all know, Charlie Scharf will join Wells Fargo next week as our new CEO and President. I've had the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with Charlie, and I'm convinced that he has the right combination of experience, business savvy, and leadership ability to position Wells Fargo for an even more successful future. I look forward to working with Charlie on a seamless transition as he assumes his responsibilities as CEO and I return to my role as the company's General Counsel. It's been an honor for me to serve as our Interim CEO and President over the last six months. I am proud that during my time in this role the company continued to move forward and we made progress on our top priorities, which include focusing on our customers and team members, meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation. Let me provide just a few examples of our most recent progress. In the area of leadership, we made important hires during the third quarter in technology, merchant services and wealth management. In addition, within Consumer Banking, we named leaders to new roles that will help us better serve our customers. David Kowach, who was most recently the head of Wells Fargo Advisors, assumed a new role as the Head of Community Banking reporting to Mary Mack. We created this role because we believe that having a single dedicated leader supporting or team members and customers in our branches will significantly further our ongoing transformation. We also formed within Consumer Banking a new Enterprise Customer Excellence group that will, over time, bring together functions from across the company and give us broader insight into the customer experience. This new group is under the leadership of Andy Rowe who led Consumer Segments (sic) [Customer Segments] and Consumer Strategy for the last two years. And in the area of Innovation and Technology, we made several important announcements during the third quarter. Wells Fargo's ongoing commitment to exploring and investing in emerging technologies through the Wells Fargo Startup Accelerator Program was demonstrated by our adding two new companies, one focused on augmented reality and the other focused on climate change risk. The total number of companies in that portfolio is now 25. We also announced plans to pilot next year Wells Fargo Digital Cash, which is designed to enable us to complete internal book transfers of cross-border payments running on our first distributed ledger technology platform. This new technology should drive operational efficiencies by providing longer operating windows and real-time processing. Finally, we announced a data exchange agreement with Plaid, a leading data platform. With this agreement, our customers will have greater control over the bank account information they share with Plaid-supported apps, including the ability to turn on or off data sharing through Wells Fargo's Control Tower. I want to conclude my comments this morning by thanking the members of our operating committee, our other senior leaders, and all our team members for their efforts, dedication, and perseverance during the last six months. In particular, I want to thank Doug Edwards for his strong and thoughtful leadership as our Interim General Counsel during this period of transition. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, but the unwavering focus of our team members on serving our customers while also working tirelessly to transform Wells Fargo has enabled us to make substantial progress toward our goals over the last six months. Looking forward, I'm confident that the extraordinary strengths of the Wells Fargo franchise when combined with our new leadership and our collective commitment to work hard to achieve further improvements will result in a company that is well positioned to benefit our shareholders and all our other stakeholders. John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Thank you, Allen, and good morning, everyone. We had a number of significant items in the third quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight on slide 2. We had $1.9 billion of operating losses, predominantly reflecting litigation accruals for a variety of matters including a $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed retail sales practices matters that was not tax deductible and reduced EPS by $0.35 per share. We had a $1.1 billion gain from the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, which contributed $0.20 per share to EPS. We had gains of $302 million from the sales of $510 of Pick-a-Pay PCI and other PCI residential mortgage loans. We had $244 million in mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments, driven predominantly by higher prepayment rate estimates on our MSRs. These valuation adjustments resulted in our mortgage banking revenue declining from the second quarter despite an increase in mortgage originations and higher production margins. We had a $105 million impairment of capitalized software reflecting a reevaluation of software under development. We also had a modest $50 million reserve build, compared with the $150 million reserve release last quarter. Finally, we partially redeemed our Series K Preferred Stock which reduced diluted EPS by $0.05 per share as a result of the elimination of purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of the Wachovia acquisition. This partial redemption will reduce the amount of our quarterly preferred stock dividends by approximately $23 million starting in the fourth quarter. While our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by these items, as Allen summarized and we highlight on slide 3, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity. We review some of our year-over-year results on page 4. Compared with third quarter of 2018, revenue was stable, with an increase of $1 billion in noninterest income driven by the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, largely offset by a $947 million decline in net interest income. Our expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals. Our net charge-off rate remains near historic lows at 27 basis points. We had a $50 million reserve build in the third quarter compared with the $100 million reserve release a year ago. We maintained strong capital levels even as we reduced common shares outstanding by 9% and increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 19% from a year ago. I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page 5 throughout the call, so we'll turn to page 6. Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a net discrete income tax expense of $443 million predominantly related to the non-tax deductible treatment of the $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 17.5%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Turning to page 7, average loans were up $10.3 billion from a year ago, and increased $2.3 billion from the second quarter. This was the first time we've had both growth year-over-year and linked quarter growth in average loans in nearly three years. Period-end loans increased $12.6 billion from a year ago, with growth in C&I, first mortgage, credit card, and auto loans, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate, junior lien mortgage, and other revolving credit and installment loans. We grew loans even as we sold or moved to held for sale a total of $7.4 billion of consumer loans over the past year. I'll highlight the drivers of the linked quarter growth in loans starting on page 9. Commercial loans were stable linked quarter as growth in C&I loans and lease financing was largely offset by declines in Commercial Real Estate loans. C&I loans were up $2 billion with broad-based growth in Corporate and Investment Banking and the purchase of CLOs in loan form in the Credit Investment Portfolio. These increases were partially offset by declines in Commercial Banking on lower Government and Institutional Banking, and middle market lending, and in Commercial Capital driven by seasonally lower Commercial Distribution Finance dealer floor plan loans. Commercial Real Estate loans declined $2.2 billion from the second quarter, with declines in both Commercial Real Estate mortgage and Commercial Real Estate construction loans, reflecting increased market liquidity, higher refinancing activity, and continued credit discipline. Lease financing increased $276 million from the second quarter, driven by growth in large-ticket direct finance leases in Equipment Finance. As we show on page 10, consumer loans increased $5 billion from the second quarter. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $4.2 billion from the prior quarter, driven by $19.3 billion of originations held for investment and the purchase of $1 billion of loans as a result of our exercising servicer cleanup calls to terminate over 20 pre-2008 securitizations. This growth was partially offset by paydowns as well as sales of $510 million of PCI mortgage loans. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1.2 billion from the second quarter, as paydowns continued to outpace new originations. Credit card loans increased $809 million, primarily due to seasonality. Our Auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up $1.1 billion from the second quarter. Originations increased 9% to $6.9 billion. We've been successfully regaining market share while maintaining our credit discipline. Our market share growth reflects the benefit of the transformational changes we've made in the business, including process improvements that have resulted in faster credit decision response times. Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits increased 2% from both a year ago and the second quarter. Average deposits increased $22.4 billion from the second quarter, with growth in Wholesale Banking as well as retail banking deposits which continued to benefit from promotional rates and offers. Our average deposit cost of $71 basis points increased 1 basis point from the second quarter, the lowest linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the second quarter was driven by a continued retail deposit campaign pricing for new deposits although we've begun to lower promotional rates and terms in response to market conditions. The increase was also impacted by unfavorable deposit mix shifts. On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits which grew 3% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Wholesale Banking deposits were up $6.6 billion from the second quarter, driven by seasonal growth in Middle Market and Business Banking, as well as growth in our Commercial Real Estate business. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $11.9 billion from the second quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits, including growth in high-yield savings and CDs. Wealth and Investment Management deposits grew as clients' reallocation of cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives slowed during the quarter. Mortgage escrow deposits grew $4.1 billion from the second quarter reflecting higher mortgage payoffs, these increases were partially offset by a $2.5 billion reduction in Corporate Treasury deposits, the second consecutive quarter of declines. Net interest income declined $470 million from the second quarter, primarily due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment as well as $133 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher prepayments. We currently expect MBS premium amortization to continue to increase in the fourth quarter but at a slower pace. We also had lower variable income and smaller positive impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting results. These declines in net interest income were partially offset by favorable balance sheet growth and mix, and the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. As you can see on the chart on this page, rates have been volatile and the yield curve has flattened significantly over the past year. Net interest income was down 8% in the third quarter and down 4% in the first nine months of 2019 compared with the same periods a year ago. As we stated last month, we currently expect net interest income to decline approximately 6% for the full year compared with 2018. As always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors, including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates, and the slope of the yield curve. Turning to page 14, noninterest income increased $896 million from the second quarter driven by the gain from the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business. Let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends. Trust and investment fees were down $9 million. Growth in retail brokerage advisory fees, asset based fees in our Asset Management business, and investment banking fees was offset by the decline in trust and investment fees as a result of the sale of our IRT business. While we no longer recognize trust and investment fees from this business, we will continue to administer client assets for up to 24 months, and the buyer will pay us a fee for certain costs we incur during this transition period. This fee was $94 million in the third quarter and was recognized in other noninterest income. Mortgage banking revenue declined $292 million from the second quarter driven by a $419 million decline in servicing income, primarily due to the valuation adjustments on our MSRs reflecting higher prepayment rate estimates. Partially offsetting this decline was $127 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities. Mortgage originations increased $5 billion from the second quarter due to higher refi volumes from lower interest rates, with refis increasing to 40% of originations in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion unclosed pipeline consistent with the second quarter, and we currently expect fourth quarter originations to remain at a similar level to the third quarter. Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $38 billion in the third quarter, and the production margin on these originations increased to 121 basis points with higher margins in both retail and corresponding channels driven by capacity constraints. We had $956 million of net gains from equity securities in the third quarter, primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. These gains were partially offset by lower deferred comp plan investment results which are largely P&L neutral. Turning to expenses on page 15. Expenses increased both – from both the second quarter and a year ago, largely due to higher operating losses primarily reflecting litigation accruals. To explain the drivers, we'll start on page 16. Expenses increased $1.8 billion from the second quarter driven by a $1.7 billion increase in operating losses. The increase in compensation and benefits reflected higher salaries expense primarily driven by one additional day in the quarter, a change in staffing mix, and higher severance expense partially offset by lower deferred comp expense. Infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense reflecting the $105 million impairment of capitalized software predominantly in our Wealth and Investment Management business, as well as higher occupancy expense. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising and promotion, FDIC expense, as well as lower T&E expense. As we show on page 17, expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses. As we've previously discussed, investments in risk management including regulatory compliance and operational risk as well as data and technology have exceeded expectations, and have offset the expense efficiency we have achieved in other areas. We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which is at the top end of our $52 billion to $53 billion target range. This excludes annual operating losses in excess of $600 million and also excludes deferred comp expense, which is largely P&L neutral, and totaled $476 million through the first nine months of the year. Turning to our business segments starting on page 19. Community Banking earnings declined $2.1 billion from the second quarter primarily driven by higher operating losses reflected – reflecting higher litigation accruals. On page 20, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We have 30.2 million digital active customers in the third quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers. Primary consumer checking customers grew for the eighth consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Branch customer experience survey scores have increased for five consecutive quarters and reached their highest levels in more than three years in September. The continued improvement in these scores reflects the transformative change we have been making to provide a better customer experience. We have enhanced training and coaching for our team members in our branches, including an increased focus on educating our customers about our industry-leading digital capabilities. On slide 21, teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. We've consolidated 130 branches in the first nine months of this year, including 52 branches in the third quarter. We continue to have strong card usage with credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago, and debit card purchase volume up 6% from a year ago. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of achieving at least 5% year-over-year growth in both debit and credit card purchase volume. Turning to page 22, Wholesale Banking earnings declined $145 million from the second quarter driven by lower net interest income reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment. We have expanded the key metrics that we provide for this business, and as you can see, we grew unfunded lending commitments on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. We're a large processor of commercial payments as evidenced by our ACH payment transactions and commercial card spend, and we grew our year-to-date market share in Investment Banking driven by higher market share and loan syndications. We're also a market leader in the high – in high grade issuances. We had record volume in the third quarter commensurate with the industry, with September being particularly strong and the fourth highest month on record for the industry fueled by the rally in Treasuries. In general, our commercial customers continue to see moderate demand and no widespread issues related to trade uncertainty and interest rate changes. We'll continue to monitor business performance closely. But to-date, while our customers are cautious, the most common concern they identify is their ability to hire enough qualified workers. Wealth and Investment Management earnings increased $678 million from the second quarter driven by the gain on the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business. Turning to page 24, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points in the third quarter. All of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the third quarter. Credit card net charge-offs have been relatively stable as we've been thoughtful in our efforts to generate new account growth, including the launch of our Propel American Express card last year. And while Auto net charge-offs increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, they were down from a year ago even as we've grown originations by 45%. We're generating growth in originations while maintaining our strong credit discipline with consistent loan-to-value, payment-to-income and FICO scores. Non-accrual loans declined $377 million from the second quarter, with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Non-accrual loans were 58 basis points of total loans, their lowest level in over ten years. We closely monitor our commercial portfolio for signs of weakness, and credit quality indicators remain strong. Our internal credit grades are at their strongest levels in two years, and since third quarter of 2017, our criticized loan balances have declined 20% with a broad-based improvement across all commercial asset classes. We currently estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL at the beginning of next year will be a reduction in our allowance of approximately $1.4 billion. Just over half of the reduction reflects the expected decrease for commercial loans given their short contractual maturities exceeding the expected incremental allowance for consumer loans that have longer or indeterminate maturities. As a reminder, we have a smaller credit card portfolio than our large bank peers which reduces the impact CECL adoption will have on our consumer loans. The remainder of the expected reduction in our allowance is predominantly related to the increase in collateral value of residential mortgage loans, which were written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. The ultimate effect of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio's credit quality, and economic conditions at the time of adoption, as well as any refinements to our models, methodology, and other key assumptions. Also, as the industry experiences credit cycles, we anticipate more volatility under a lifetime reserving approach versus the incurred loss approach. Turning to capital on page 25, our CET1 ratio fully phased-in decreased to 11.6%, driven by returning $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter. This was up 50% from the $6 billion we returned last quarter. As a reminder, similar to last year, our plan, subject to market conditions and management discretion, is to use approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second half of 2019. In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our third quarter financial results, we had strong underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity, strong credit performance, and higher capital returns. I'm optimistic that our continued efforts to transform Wells Fargo and the fundamental strengths of our franchise will continue to position us well for success. And Allen and I will now take your questions. Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Morning. As we think about what the forward curve is telling us – and obviously, it's been quite a volatile outlook for the forward curve – and some of the momentum that you talked about on the growth side in lending, as we think about the 6% NII decline in 2019, given sort of the forward curve plus that momentum, how should we think about NII decline expectations for 2020? Yeah, well, it's complicated. Because you can say there's a lot of things going into it, including where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, a variety of things. But if we – in the various scenarios that we run, thinking about, let's say, the 9/30 implied forward curve which suggests fed funds in the 1.70% area at 12/31 of this year, and the 10-year just under 1.70%, and then a year forward, fed funds in the 1.20% area and fed funds still in the 1.70% – or pardon me, 10-year still in the 1.70% area, that with a range of assumptions about loans and deposits probably gets us to down low- to mid-single digits in net interest income. Maybe not as much of a decline from 2018 to 2019, but – there's a number of scenarios that it seems – that would seem to capture it. Got it. And my second question, obviously, you can't speak for the new CEO. The questions that we're getting from your investor base is that they're trying to gauge how much further investment there needs to be sort of going forward. And you mentioned yourself, John, that the investment in risk compliance and data had exceeded your expectations. And again, you can't speak for Charlie, but as you think about how those investments played out, relative to investment in, let's say, innovation and as you think about where you are versus peers, is there a significant catch-up gap because you've spent a lot of those dollars on risk compliance and data? How should we think about investment spend from here? Yeah. So, I think when Charlie arrives, we'll conduct a complete strategic review of where all the businesses stand, of where we – what our opportunities are, et cetera, including a review of how we've been investing on the risk compliance side, et cetera, and then formulate a view going forward. One thing that probably doesn't get enough focus is that a lot of the money and time that we spent on the risk and control side of things really does enable further innovation. So, the money we spend in technology and data, for example, has huge customer impact down the road. So, there's not an either/or necessarily, there's a lot of mutual benefit from running a more controlled environment. But that will be work that we'll all do together with Charlie after he arrives, and then present conclusions at the right time. Got it. Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Scott. Just kind – sort of a follow-up question on costs. So, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q. Maybe if you could just take a moment to go through some of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter? And then, just along the lines of costs into 2020, I know you previously suggested that costs could be flat in 2020, is that still something you're thinking? Or now with Charlie coming on board, do we sort of just sort of wait till he comes on, takes a look at things, and then give him complete discretion on what the cost outlook looks like? Yes. So, the second half, I think you answered that, which is we should wait and allow him to have an input onto the composition of how we're spending money in the future. For Q4, though, as you pointed out, it does imply a step-down, and I think the biggest sources of that are other professional fees and some labor-related expense, but it does require that. That's how the math works, and that's how we're forecasted right now. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, just separately on mortgage, I think you had said that the originations should stay around this quarter's level into the fourth quarter. Hopefully, I heard that correctly. Maybe if you could just sort of comment on where you see gain on sale margins trending with a nice uptick this quarter? And, overall, given the moving parts that you see, should we expect mortgage revenues to be at or above what we saw this quarter, particularly if we don't get the same sort of MSR noise? Yeah. So, on the origination side, it's hard to say what the full quarter gain on sale is, but we do think it'll be in the neighborhood of where it's been recently which is, call it, 120 basis points, which was a big tick-up and welcome. On the servicing side, while I wouldn't expect there to be any revaluation in the fourth quarter – we think we've got that in the third quarter – we recall that we are at a flatter curve environment, so the carry for holding Treasuries as a hedge to the MSR, sometimes it works for us in a steeper curve environment, and sometimes it's either neutral or works against us when the curve gets flatter. So, we shouldn't earn as much on the hedge, but we probably wouldn't have the type of valuation items we saw in Q3. Okay. All right. Terrific. Thank you very much for the color. Yes. Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Hi, John. Hi. Good morning. Hey, John. Wanted to ask about deposits, on deposit pricing. With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter? Assuming rates stays flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max pain quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe just some puts and takes for the fourth quarter for NIM versus this quarter? Yeah. So, my expectation is that deposit cost will be cheaper in the fourth quarter, reflecting what you described in terms of the kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease. Having said that, there still was less room to go down on the deposit side. And so, if rates continue to move down on the asset side, it still works against us even if deposit costs aren't rising. So, we have to be as vigilant as we can to keep deposit costs as low as makes sense for the businesses and customers that we serve. But even if they're not rising, there's still leverage working against us in a declining rate environment. And in terms of good guys, bad guys – fourth quarter versus third, what's worse and what's maybe better than what you experienced this quarter on a – just the NIM percentage? Well, I think we're imagining having a little bit higher levels of MBS premium amortization, so that will be working for us in the fourth quarter. It depends. In terms of wholesale pricing – Wholesale Banking deposit pricing, working with the higher beta customers to make sure that we reduce those as quickly as possible. There's probably more room to run on that with a little bit of the passage of time, that could be a benefit. The burnout of more promotional activity on the consumer side is probably a net benefit, and those are some of the bigger items. Okay. And can I ask one more follow-up on the expenses? Is it... Sure. ...accurate for us to think that there are some elements of your inflation and expenses that are temporary? I mean, helping you get to the best-in-class and satisfy your regulators? And then, other parts that are permanent, like helping you stay best-in-class and keep satisfying regulators and some of that, what you're building might get more efficient over time and then, obviously, a lot of it will stay? Yeah. I think that's a good point. And there's a real opportunity for taking best-in-class and then making it much more efficient. I think, maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is, just through process consolidation and process re-engineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward. And both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient. Some of that is converting multiple manual processes to fewer processes  (00:35:47), some of it is converting manual process to automated process. But all of that is upside from where we – from the day that we determine that we think we've achieved the best-in-class requirement from an operational risk and compliance perspective. Okay. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Hey, thanks. Hey, John. One follow-up on the NII side. So, keeping the minus 6% NII guide for the year kind of gets you  $11.4-ish million (00:36:20) for the year. And down even 5% next year kind of holds you at that  $11.4-ish million (00:36:24). And so, I know there's so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then or how – versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap and what constraints, if anything, might you have as this gets further out. Thanks. Yeah. Within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being – as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impacts in terms of consumers and our business customers. And we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use. And then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective. So, I guess, the low-single digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for – or reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds. It could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate pads and getting to a low- to mid-single digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019. Understood. Thanks. And a follow-up on the fee side. You got the IRT coming out that you spoke about, and it was in the deck. And then, you've got Eastdil. Can you just help us understand how you think about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of the revenue and expense trajectory? Thanks, John. Yeah. Well, so with IRT, I think we actually have a – there's a page in the back of the supplement that shows you exactly what to expect there. And not to oversimplify it, but it's on the order of $100 million a quarter, I think, for both revenue and expense, at least as we process it. Eastdil coming out starting in the fourth quarter is probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L. It shows up in a couple other areas too when they have investment banking fees. But similarly, the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience. So, when we finish Q4 and we talk about our 2019 expenses – and we will provide a reconciliation for people to be able to show where we ended up and we'll be sure to call out both of those things – actually, it won't really impact – IRT won't impact it because the expenses are still in our run rate and we're recovering them. Eastdil will be a minor adjustment because there won't be expenses for Q4. Understood. Thank you, John. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Hi, John. Morning. On – staying on the loan growth topic, you saw some pretty good declines in the Commercial Real Estate portfolios this quarter again. And just want to get your updated thoughts there, is that still an area that you're – expect to see some runoff still or, in other words, lack of growth, I guess? Thanks. Yeah. So, we had a couple quarters with small growth, and then we shrunk again a little bit this quarter. As I understand it, I think our commitments for construction financing are actually up in the third quarter, which will come through as funded loans. That really is one market where there's late cycle behavior, there's lots of non-bank competitors – there are more non-bank competitors than bank competitors – and so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk/ reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality. And it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior, by the way. So, we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books. But I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it. So, I could be wrong, but it feels to me like it's going to be treading water while our best customers either refinance deals that were already in or prudently take advantage of what the market offers them. But I don't see it as an area for outsized growth. Okay. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the fee side, the equity investment gains saw a pretty good jump in the quarter. If you could just give us a little bit of color on what drove that and if you can give us a little thoughts on your outlook there? Thank. Yes, sure. There's couple of things that drive that. One is just it's a great time to be realizing from both private equity and venture portfolios. And so, our teams have been selling into that, and that's – it's where we've been at the high point in the cycle for a while now. So, with respect to the second part of your question, I expect that to reflect what kind of private market we're in. And if it's still is as strong in financing, is as accommodating it is – as it is today, then I expect that they'll continue to harvest and things will be good. It's a little bit harder of an environment for them to be putting capital to work because asset prices are so high. The other thing that contributes to it is we had a change in accounting a year or so ago, which is causing us to recognize unrealized gains where there's a subsequent capital raise and a private deal that causes us to have to mark up our position. And it's always been true if one of those companies goes public but our affiliate still ends up owning shares for a period of time that we write up the – we recognize the gain even though we haven't liquidated our position, so that's contributing. That will contribute to some more volatility here because that can't only be one way even though it's been a benefit for the last year. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Hey, Matt. Good morning. So, it seems like the NIM percent could bottom somewhere in the 2.50s and I'm just trying to get a sense of, is that like a reasonable NIM when I think about your mix, right? Everyone's trying to compare you to both your bigger peers and your smaller, and you don't have as much credit card as some, so that hurts you, but you also don't have as much trading book as some, so that should help you. (00:43:07) And then, just to throw a couple things out, like there's still some assets where it seems like you're overearning, like in the securities book. But there's also some deposits that you're overpaying. So, what are your thoughts around kind of, again, based on some of the things that you said for 2020, net II and thinking about just keeping rates where the forward curve is, like that NIM in the 2.50s, like, is that a normal NIM for you in this backdrop? Yes. Or there's still some... So, we're not currently forecasting over our horizon to quite hit that level. I mean, it's not that far off either of where we are today or what's likely to unfold. I agree, that while we do have some special things on the asset or the liability side, the sale of the Pick-a-Pay loans and what they were contributing to interest income and to NIM is probably something that isn't going to be replicated. So, I think that – once that fully runs through the comparison period, I mean, it's affecting the NIM already, that's out. And I don't think there's that much more on the loan side that's high yielding that's rolling off. On the liability side, we did mention that there are some promotional deposits and other things that are – that will – that are burning down because they were in place as we were on the way up in rates, and so that will be a benefit. But I don't think we get quite to 2.50% in our forecast horizon. A lot of things go into that, of course, and we don't manage to NIM, we're much more thinking about dollars of net interest income. But if that's helpful, that's how we're seeing it. Yeah, and I was thinking – I was kind of thinking 2.50s broadly speaking, but that is helpful. And then, just specifically, like, as we think about exiting fourth quarter net interest income, you're obviously going to be carrying or absorbing higher than normal bond premium amortization. So, we don't want to run rate all that. What is the level of the bond premium amortization this quarter? You said it increased $131 million (sic) [$133 million] but what's the run rate? Yeah, the – from – for MBS, it's just under $400 million for the quarter, and it was just under $250 million for the second quarter. And we think it will be up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So, it's been about $775 million year-to-date through the third quarter. Okay. And then, just last question on this. As we think about exiting this year, just assuming rates stay where they are now, does that go to zero? Or there's still going to be just some ongoing amount in the pro forma  (00:45:47)? I assume there will still be some ongoing amount if we stay in this context for 10-year and mortgage rates with the velocity of prepayments. You heard me mention that we're at about 40% refis right now in our own production, and our pipeline is as big coming out of the third quarter as it was going in. And so, that may take months or even quarters for in the moneyness of the outstanding stock of mortgages – agency mortgages to work their way through the system. But there's a whole lot more people who are in the money for a refi today than was true a few quarters ago. So, I don't think that's going to abate quickly. Okay. (00:46:28) And if I could just be greedy here. If I could just be greedy... Yes, go ahead. ...and squeeze in one other thing. You talked about the increased spending in regulation compliance controls, related areas versus two or three years ago. Is there a dollar amount that you can provide on that increase? Or I think at one point you did talk about the head count increase. Maybe you could update that and we can make some estimates of – if you can't give us the dollar amount? Thank you. Yeah. I don't have a crisp answer for you, only because it appears everywhere. It appears in the front line, it appears in the second line, it appears in technology, it appears in a variety of areas. We'll – I think we'll try and put a comparison together for folks to get a picture of not only what we think about it – how we think about it historically, but how we think about it going forward. Back to John McDonald's question of what do we look like at the high water mark versus what efficient looks like over time? I think that's detail that people should be able to understand as that story unfolds. And I think, as we finish this work that we do with Charlie and we talk about what the next steps are expense-wise, that's a reasonable expectation from our team. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Hi, David. Hi, David. Good morning, everyone. Looking at your securities portfolio, what type of yield do you have rolling off the securities book this quarter? And then, what are you looking at for reinvestment yield? Yeah, I think, in general, we're reinvesting about 25 basis points down from what has been rolling off. And, of course, it depends on whether it's agency MBS, which is the bulk of our purchases. We also have some Treasuries and agency debentures and we have some structured products and other things. But on average, I think our purchases in Q3 were just north of a 3% yield. And what's been rolling off, from a coupon perspective, has been high 3s; from a yield perspective, has been not terribly different than 3%. So, in agency MBS in particular, I want to say that we're probably down, gosh, 25 to 25-plus basis points on a reinvestment rate basis. Okay. Got it. And then, the second question I have relates to the potential future litigation losses. And I know in the – in your Q, you give that number, and it seems to be rising in most quarters. Do you have that number? What the number may be here in the – as of September 30? No, it will keep – the number will keep being refined until we file the Q, which will happen in a couple of weeks. So, be on the lookout for that, for the latest which will include everything we know up until that date. Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. You bet. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Hi, Vivek. Hi, John.  (00:49:46) Let me just start with a question that either of you could respond to. So, there was an issue that came up in the middle of the third quarter that The New York Times reported about accounts closed that were being charged fees after they were closed. Can you give some color on this issue? When it was discovered? The number of customers? What's involved? Where are you on the timeline of all of this? And actually, overarching, why this even is coming up now? Vivek, thank you for the question. I guess what I would say is, at this point, there's really not any further information that we can give you with regard to that situation. We have obviously, in response to the article that appeared, gone back and looked at all our account closure information. And we've been working very closely with our regulatory agencies ever since then. We're at the point now where we're coming to some conclusions about what happened, but it would frankly be premature at this point for me to really give you any information in that regard. I mean, we're taking a look at what happened. We're trying to determine the veracity of what was said in The New York Times, and perhaps, most important, we're trying to determine whether we ought to make any changes at all with regard to the way that we've been conducting ourselves in that arena. I wish I could be more forthcoming in terms of information, but it's still in progress. And it's been an effort in which we've been engaged very closely with our regulators. You mean, when you say conducting yourselves, as in just the whole process of how it works, account closures, et cetera? Or something else? Yes, the whole process of account closures is complicated in any financial institution because there are situations where people close their accounts voluntarily whether they call a call center or they walk into a branch, and there are also situations where accounts have to be closed for legal or regulatory reasons. And there are a variety of considerations that go into how that's done, and we're going through very carefully and looking at all those considerations and coming to a conclusion as to the changes, if any, that we ought to make with respect to the way that we've handled ourselves in the past. Completely separate question for John. John, you mentioned about the promotional retail deposits. Are you completely stopping it or are you just reducing the rates that you're offering by the amount of rate cuts that we've seen, which is what several other players have done with their higher yield offerings? There'll always be some level of promotional activity. It should reflect the market conditions that we're competing in, both in terms of rates and terms. I think, like a lot of people, with the expectation of lower rates, shortening up initial terms so that we're not overpaying for a longer period of time that it might have previously felt like it was necessary in the rising rate environment. So, we've – there's some of it in the third quarter. We've eased off on pricing. We've eased off on terms. But just like your firm, there'll always be some amount of it to make sure that we're competitive market by market and to test and learn. One last thing, if I may. You, in the past, have given us loans to non-depositary financials outstanding. Could you give the number what that is this quarter? Let's see. I'm looking at the papers around me here. I don't think it's changed much during the course of the quarter. Yeah, I know – we'll follow up with you on that. There wasn't a meaningful move in that category during the course of the quarter. But I don't have it handy. Okay. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Compton with Morningstar. Hi, Eric. Hello, Eric. Thanks for – good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question, you made the comment that one of the areas of expenses that you expect to be helping you meet your full-year guidance is from that other professional fees line item. And I was just curious if you have any more color around why that might be dropping, what might be causing that, if that's related to perhaps progress on some of the risk and compliance spending and maybe taking some more or a higher percentage of those activities in-house, any more color on what's driving that? Yeah, that's a good question. So, some of it is definitely having taken some of it in-house. The amount by which we're talking about it changing, frankly, isn't indicative of a giant pivot one way or the other. It's still a category that is too high. It represents both consulting type firms where we've been getting expertise as well as labor augmentation or staff augmentation, particularly in technology labor where we've been hiring people as contractors where we haven't been able to hire as quickly as necessary. I think, like all firms, there's a portion of our workforce in that area that is on contract. So, with the shift in the fourth quarter is the current forecast just based on what's rolled on and what's rolled off and the current body of work. But there's still a lot of it going on. It's still a level that is too high, and as we roll forward and think about what efficient looks like, there's no doubt that that category coming down substantially will be high on the list of sources of a more efficient state to be operating in. Okay. That's helpful. And then, one last question. I appreciate it if you don't want to comment on this too much, but just going back to the legal reserve estimate, understanding the official number will come out in the Q. But we had that $800 million jump and now we're getting that $1.6 billion charge – or the jump in the high end of the legal reserve estimate and now the charge in the current quarter and just the operating losses. And just curious if there's any color on – do you get a sense, we're starting to get more towards the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to this? Should we start to see this, the legal reserve estimate start to trend down, is that your sense? Just any more color around, I guess, behind the scenes, what's going on there? Yeah, as you prefaced your question with, we really can't provide anything in the way of color on this. As you know, we don't provide information as for the portion of our reserves that's allocable to any particular litigation or other items. And with regard to the DOJ and SEC investigations that began in 2006, we really don't have any update beyond what we said in our prepared remarks of what we've previously disclosed in our last quarter 10-Q. Our discussions with the DOJ and SEC are ongoing, and when we have more information to disclose, we'll of course do so. Could I just... Absolutely. You said 2006, you meant 2016. Yes, I'm sorry. There's nothing from 2006. Nothing from 2006, thankfully. Okay. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. Sure. And while the next one's coming, Vivek, the number is $104 billion as of September 30 for the exposure – total exposure to non-bank financials. Your next question will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So, hey, I feel like – I hate to beat a dead horse with the NII, but I feel like either I'm taking the guidance too literally or I'm missing something. But if the outlook is still for NII to decline 6% on a reported basis and, I guess, $1.8 billion decline versus the first half, it seems to suggest that the fourth quarter NII is roughly about $11 billion. And even if you do a little bit better than that, it still implies pretty substantial declines in NII and NIM degradation in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And everything – a lot of what you said, John, in terms of less incremental headwind from premium am, deposit cost maybe starting to peak out and even reduce a little bit or fall a bit in the next quarter, the headwinds from the purchased credit-impaired PCI should start to moderate just because you're selling less of it at least on a sequential basis. It seems like that the balance sheet mix and repricing element is pretty pronounced to get there. So, I guess, what am I missing? And is it – is the – is it really just that the impact of the rate cuts, the lower  long (00:58:55) is that pronounced in terms of the impact on asset yield? Well, I think it's the asset side that's sort of fully reflecting the repricing down. We talked about the deposit costs being – not being higher, probably being a little bit lower. And it gets you to the types of numbers that you described. Okay. Very close. Okay. But the math is right? I guess, the math is right that it's 6% would be in the $11 billion or so range for the fourth quarter on a reported basis? That's right. Okay. All right. I just wanted to be clear. So, wanted to just maybe ask about a different topic. And I apologize, I was on a little bit late, if – Allen, if you addressed it, but any update on where you stand on the consent order and remediating the operational risk and controls? And it seems like there's a lot of blocking and tackling there in terms of all of the processes that you're looking at, identifying risk and controls and where appropriate remediating those. Can you just give us a sense on, regardless of what the Fed does and when they lift it, where you feel like you are in that process? And do you feel like you need to get past that before you can really attack the cost structure in a meaningful way? Yeah, thanks. And let me start on that and I'll turn it over to John. I mean, it – our conversation with our regulators are, of course, Confidential Supervisory Information. But I can say that our engagement with the regulators has been very constructive and we're in constant dialogue with them on a number of fronts. As everybody recalls, several of the regulators made public statements earlier in the year in which they expressed their disappointment with the progress we made up until that time. In response to that criticism which, of course, we accepted, over the last six months, we redoubled our efforts with regard to trying to satisfy their expectations. And I've made clear – and I know Charlie will as well that the entire Wells Fargo team must continue to act assertively and decisively to meet the regulators' expectations going forward. With regard to the issues raised in the Fed consent order, the feedback that we are getting from the Fed on a constant basis is enabling us to continue to make progress in terms of responding to their expectations. We're a good ways down the road, but I think it's fair to say that we have a substantial amount of additional work to do. And, of course, at the same time, we've designed and implemented and we're constantly working to enhance our new risk management framework. And that's fundamentally transforming how we manage risk every day throughout the organization in a way that I would describe as much more comprehensive, integrated, and consistent. And at the same time, we're enhancing front line risk, independent risk management, and the audit function so that we can ensure multiple layers of review and better visibility into issues as they emerge. And obviously, the goal of all this is to prevent the occurrence of kind of the kinds of issues that we had in the past. And as John alluded to before, we're also emphasizing operational excellence throughout the company. Our biggest focus there is on business process management in an effort to try to deliver greater consistency. So, I guess, what I will say – and I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the financial impacts is that there's a great deal of work to do to meet the expectations of our regulators, they're appropriately high. But we're committed to completing that work. We're working very hard and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the work in a manner that's timely and, just as important, up to the highest standards of professionalism and durability going forward. Yeah. And so, to the second part of your question, so we've had these efficiency programs in place for the last few years, which began before this biggest push in response to the Fed consent order and some other regulatory feedback. But through that process, we've got hundreds of programs that have gone activity by activity and set about taking unnecessary cost out. And then, at the same time, we've embarked on this getting it right from an operational risk compliance governance perspective, including all the enabling technology, which is where all this money is being reinvested. So, the – as I mentioned earlier on this call, the big opportunity once Wells Fargo, both internally and from a regulatory perspective, has changed the bar for being excellent at operational risk compliance and governance overall, like we believe we are in credit risk and some other areas, is a massive simplification. Because as we go down this business process management path, we inventory and uncover the fact that we do just about everything we do in many different ways. And there's a huge opportunity to compress that to get more consistent. It improves the customer experience, the team member experience, it's easier to control, it's easier to automate, and it's much less expensive to deliver. And I think from an investor perspective, it's important to know that we're fixing our status quo Wells Fargo, the way that our individual processes have – currently operate. And then, there's the opportunity to reengineer it. Now, that may look different after we've sat down and done a complete strategic review with Charlie, but it is how the team has set about doing the business or doing the remediation that's necessary to improve the company today, starting with the way things are done today. But there's a, from my perspective, an extraordinary efficiency opportunity in modernizing that. Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. Your final question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Hi, Betsy. Oh, hey. Hi. Good morning. Two quick questions. One, just on the MSR revaluation, I mean, I realize there was some prepays in the quarter and I know you guys are really good at estimating that, so just wondering if there was something else or was it just a more violent move than expected? And is it a one-timer in your opinion that is not going to pop back up, I would expect, but just wanted to get your understanding on that. Yeah, well, it was a bigger move than was expected. And I'm always – I'm reluctant to say that it could never happen again. But the way we estimate the customer response to their – in the moneyness for a refinance given what we know about what type of cohort they fall in is the basis of how we estimate that. And it happened – it's been happening at a faster pace, and so we've – we think we've captured that in this valuation adjustment. Okay. And then, on the Auto lending side, I know you highlighted that the reconfiguration, restructuring of that business is now finished. And we saw some really strong results this quarter with originations up – what is it – 9% linked quarter. Do you feel like it's the start of the rebalancing of that Auto business? Is this a run rate that you think you can keep for the – I don't know -foreseeable future? I'm just trying to get a sense of the sizing of the Auto book that you think you can get back to post this restructuring of that business. Yeah. My sense is that if we still like the risk/reward, so if consumer credit stays about where it is and if used car values stay about where they are, that there's an opportunity for us to grow further. So, as I mentioned, the growth that we've gotten so far is really by doing more in the same upper-echelon credit tiers, and we previously ran the business with – including a little bit more in the – at least the non-prime category. And my sense is that we'll probably begin to do that too over the course of the next couple of quarters. We're sort of – we're easing into it. But I don't think of this uptick as aberrant, and I think that there's more to do. Okay. Thanks. Let me close our call by thanking all of you for your questions and for joining our third quarter conference call. As always, I'd also like to thank all our team members for their hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. Best regards to you all. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%. Underlying performance continues to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking up 13%, strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volumes in Home Lending and Auto, and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Cards. Number one in Global IB fees year-to-date, with over 9% wallet share and record gross IB revenues in middle market. And in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets. Overall for the firm, total loans were flat year-on-year, which includes continued mortgage loan sales. Ex. these sales, loans were up 3% on healthy growth in Card and AWM. Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail. And credit performance remains strong across businesses. On to page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year, as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Non-interest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million. Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.5 billion reflecting modest net reserve builds and charge-offs in line with expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. Now onto balance sheet and capital on page 3; we ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, up about 10 basis points versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. Now onto page 4 for a look at our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year. Revenue of $14.3 billion was up 7% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year, with deposit up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels. Revenue was up 5%, driven by higher NII on deposit growth and margin expansion, as well as higher non-interest revenue on higher transaction volumes. And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment. Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales. With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal, with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate. And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion, as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8%, with sales up 10% and merchant processing volume was up 11%. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, starting with reserves; this quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in Card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking. The build in Card was primarily driven by mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.8 billion and an ROE of 13% on revenue of $9.3 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down. It was a record third quarter for Investment Banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory. Year-to-date, we continue to rank number one in overall IB wallet and gained share across products and regions, benefiting from our leadership positions in the technology and healthcare sectors. In advisory, we were down 13% year-on-year, reflecting lower deal activity compared to a strong prior year; however, we continued to gain wallet share driven by our strategic investments. In debt underwriting, we were up 17% year-on-year in a market that was down. Here, we benefited from our participation in some large transactions and increased activity in Investment Grade Bonds. In equity underwriting, we were up 22% year-on-year, significantly outperforming the market, driven by our strong performance in IPOs and convertibles. And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked number one in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IB fees to be down both sequentially and year-on-year, driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year. However, the pipeline remains healthy, as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance, and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year. This quarter was characterized by strong client activity across the board, with outperformance in Agency Mortgage trading and improved flows in Rates and Commodities. Equity Markets was down 5% against a very strong third quarter last year. Equity Derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but Prime remained strong and Cash outperformed relative to the prior year. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, down 7% and 2% year-on-year respectively. The rate environment remained a relative headwind, primarily from the funding basis compression we've been talking about, which is largely firm-wide neutral; and to a lesser extent, client-specific repricing in Treasury Services. But importantly, the organic growth in fees and balances continues to be strong. Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year, with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges. And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $937 million and an ROE of 16%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII driven by lower deposit margins, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong Investment Banking performance. Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity. And we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market. Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges. Deposit balances were up 3% year-on-year on strong client flows. Loan balances were flat year-on-year across both C&I and CRE. In C&I, while we are seeing pockets of growth in select industries, like financial institutions, technology and energy, there does continue to be significant runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in Real Estate Banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points. Now onto Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $668 million with pre-tax margin of 25% and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels, as well as deposit and loan growth, were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisors, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees. Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs, as well as reserve builds on loan growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $40 billion driven by fixed income and net liquidity inflows of $24 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3.1 trillion, both records, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels. Deposits were up 4% year-on-year driven by growth in interest-bearing products. Finally, we had record loan balances up 7%, with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now onto Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $393 million. Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix, as well as the funding offset from the mortgage loan sales that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates. This quarter also included small net gains on certain legacy private equity investments compared to approximately $200 million of net losses in the prior year. And expenses of $281 million were up $253 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher investments in technology and a prior year net legal benefit. Finally, turning to page 9 and the outlook. Our full year outlook remains in-line with previous guidance. We expect net interest income to come in slightly below $57.5 billion based on the latest implieds, and adjusted expense to be approximately $65.5 billion. So, to wrap up, the US economy is on solid footing and while global growth is slowing, the US consumer remains healthy. Despite continued macro uncertainty and headwinds from the rate environment, this quarter showcases the diversification and scale of our business model. We remain well-positioned to outperform in any environment and will continue to strategically invest in our businesses. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Hi. Thanks very much. Hi, Glenn. Curious your take on everything that went on in the repo markets during the quarter, and I would love it if you could put it in the context of maybe the fourth quarter of last year. If I remember correctly, you stepped in in the fourth quarter, saw higher rates, threw money at it, made some more money, and it calmed the markets down. I'm curious what's different this quarter that did not happen, and curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the market to function better on a go-forward basis. So, if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of – we have a checking account at the Fed with a certain amount of cash in it. Last year we had more cash than we needed for regulatory requirements. So when repo rates went up, we went from the checking account, which  was paying (00:14:10) IOER into repo. Obviously makes sense, you make more money. But now the cash in the account, which is still huge – it's $120 billion in the morning and goes down to $60 billion during the course of the day and back to $120 billion at the end of the day – that cash, we believe, is required under resolution and recovery and liquidity stress testing. And therefore, we could not redeploy it into repo market, which we would have been happy to do. And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account. Again, I look at this as technical; a lot of reasons why those balances dropped to where they were. I think a lot of banks were in the same position, by the way. But I think the real issue, when you think about it, is what does that mean if we ever have bad markets? Because that's kind of hitting the red line in the Fed checking account, you're also going to hit a red line in LCR, like HQLA, which cannot redeployed either. So, to me, that will be the issue when the time comes. And it's not about JPMorgan. JPMorgan will be fine in any event. It's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes. And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third quarter results. Yeah, I feel bad for whoever borrowed at 10%. Could I just ask a quickie on NII? I heard you on the full year 2019 commentary, and I don't think that's surprising, maybe even a little bit better. Have you done much repositioning on the balance sheet as we look forward in 2020, which is looking like an obviously lower rate backdrop? You know, I want to ask you what your thoughts are on 2020 NII, but I'd rather hear the soft color, because I know you're not going to give it to us. Well, I'll try. So, in terms of balance sheet positioning, as you know, we have a negatively convexed balance sheet. We manage it in both directions. Some moves in interest rates are hedgeable and some are not. In a quarter like we just had with the rally that we had, you would expect us to buy duration, and we did. But in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter of just under $14 billion. Frankly, that's not a bad place to start. There will be some puts and takes. Obviously, you would have to get the full run rate of the October cut, because, of course, this is all based on the implieds. And then there's one more cut next year. But an offset to that, at least a partial offset to that, would be balance sheet growth and mix. So, we'll give you more color at Investor Day, as we always do, and we'll be in a better position then. But the fourth quarter of 2019 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley Hi. Good morning. Hi. A couple questions. One on your GSIB bucket. I know as of the end of June it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year-end. And is there a plan to get back down and how would you affect that? Sure. So as it relates to GSIB, we fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. As you know, most aspects of GSIB are on a spot basis, so we will manage it like we do any scarce resource and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. But is there a – does that impact just your market position in general? Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, et cetera? Or is it really not, is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you? You're not going to see. Yeah, what we need to do across the various GSIB buckets will not be obvious in our fourth quarter results. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket. It's more than just leverage. Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes, good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Glenn's question. As we think about the crosscurrents of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us – what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan? As I said, we have $120 billion in our checking account at the Fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 billion during the average day. But we believe the requirement under CLAR and resolution and recovery is that we need enough in that account, so if there's extreme stress during the course of the day, it doesn't go below zero. If you go back to before the crisis, you'd go below zero all the time during the day. So the question is, how hard is that as a red line? Was the intent of regulators between CLAR and resolution to lock up that much of reserves in the account with Fed? And that'll be up to regulators to decide. But right now, we have to meet those rules and we don't want to violate anything we've told them we're going to do. Got it. And as my follow-up, Jenn, you said something about the offset to the two Fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix. Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and 22% increase in investment securities balances? Sure. Well, I'll come back to investment securities balances. But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think of that largely in deposits. And just as one example, obviously, the rate environment and the economy will matter a whole lot. But just in a declining rate environment, the higher yielding alternatives for consumers are less attractive. And so we do expect to continue to grow the franchise and we could see healthy growth in the deposit base. So that's what I was referring to. In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on. As I said earlier, we did buy duration but, importantly, what you see in investment securities are also cash deployment strategies as well as actions we took on the back of the mortgage loan sales. So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter. In some cases, securities had a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did. Yes. Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Hi. So you, I guess, lowered your guidance for NII, but also lowered your guidance for expenses. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology? Or just more generally, at every Investor Day, you tell us you're going to spend – what – $12 billion on technology, and we don't really have a lot of insight into the traction that those technology investments are getting. So, what's working technology-wise? What's not working? And how much of that can contribute to your improved expense guidance? Okay, sure. So I'll start  and give it to you if (00:22:01) you want to add. Go ahead So I would say, Mike, the NII guidance is not lower. At the second quarter, we said $57.5 billion, plus or minus. At the time, the implieds had three rate cuts, July, September, and December, and we said if there were two or more, then it would be $57.5 billion minus; and if less than that, perhaps $57.5 billion plus. And so, we are kind of right where we said we would be. And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balance growth and one less cut in December. So, I would say NII guidance broadly in line. On expenses and technology, there's a few things you can think about. First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here. But importantly, you have to look at the underlying story, which I know is what you're getting at, which is there are volume or revenue-related expenses, and we're always looking for productivity there. But they will be what they will be. They will come with top line growth. In terms of investments, we will continue with the discipline we always have around business cases and net present value and payback periods, but we will also always invest in the things we think we need to, even if they're table stakes. And then there's productivity, which is your point. And so we continue to realize productivity in our investments and we continue to think we have opportunity ahead. We haven't laid that out in terms of quantifying it, but some of the things you could think about are robotics, replacing repetitive processes. You can think about machine learning or AI in fraud. So, machine learning assisting us in decision-making processes. Our call centers are always getting more productive. As Gordon said at Investor Day, our cost to serve in the consumer businesses are down 15%. And then digital capabilities that we're rolling out to our customers in terms of self-service is not only better for them, but more efficient for us. And so we have realized significant productivity to-date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments, and think we still have room to run. Clearly said, (00:24:17) merchant  processing (24:19), new systems, an API store for CIB, the stuff we built to hook in Aladdin to our custody business. So you can go business by business and see the extensive amount of stuff we're rolling out, and it's pretty good. All right. Let me have one follow-up then. So, I mean, how many call center personnel do you have or how many data centers do you have? And how does that compare to the peak? We're building brand-new data centers as we speak. I forgot the total number, but there's quite a few. The new ones being better and more efficient and more expandable and safer, more secure, all that kind of stuff. And we have to build that infrastructure to have the best in the world. So we're not going to ever scrimp on something like that. And maybe at Investor Day we could go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget. Yes. I'd like to do that. And then on call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of number of people. We think about the productivity of the people, so the number of calls that they're able to take because you may have more people because of more volume, but that's good, healthy volume with top line growth. But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing. Yeah. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in Card and consumer has come down, not gone up, because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers, right, I won't take you through all of them, because then we're telling the bad guys our secrets, but there are lot of ways to stop some of the bad guys now. Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. To start off with sort of a broader question on just the macro outlook. I think, Jenn, you mentioned that you feel the US economy's on sound footing; the consumer is obviously strong. But we are seeing some softening in the economic data. What are you hearing from clients? What are they telling you about, whether they're concerned or whether there's increasing concern on policy, macro uncertainties, and how you're thinking about that going forward? Sure. So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty. But broadly speaking, while it's lower growth, it's still growth. As I said, the US consumer is incredibly strong. Consumer spending is strong. Sentiment is strong for the consumer. Credit is good. And it is true that if you look at the ISM surveys, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, they were recently disappointing. So, I would say, no doubt, cautionary signs, but credit remains very good, and there's still very healthy business activity. Okay, great. That's helpful. On NII, just going back to NII specifically in the CCB, if you adjust for the $350 million, you actually grew sequentially, which was a pretty strong result. And I know guidance is at the consolidated level. But how do we think about the glide path in that business going forward and some of the puts and takes? Deposit pricing came in a little bit at the consolidated level. I suspect some of that's commercial. But how do we think about that business and the NII trajectory? And is it possible that you can continue to grow that? So, I mean, there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds if the implieds play out. We're not immune to that. But, as I said earlier, there is at least a partial offset to that in growth, and so we still feel very good about the underlying growth that we're seeing there. And then just in terms of reprice, obviously, there's very little movement on the back of the Fed ease, given there is very little movement on the way up. And, in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest bearing. But we love the platform. The branch expansion is going very, very well, and so we feel great about the continued growth there. But we won't be immune to rate headwinds. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Good morning. Can you guys give us some additional color on the Investment Banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter? And then second, if you take a look at the success that you had in Investment Banking, grabbing more wallet share, is it coming here in North America or in Asia? Can you give us some color there as well? Sure. So on the IB pipeline, I would say it's healthy, although we do expect to be down in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year on very strong performances in the third quarter, as well as the fourth quarter of last year. But overall, it feels healthy. And I would say geographically, largely it's on strength in the US. And then following up in the Markets business, again, you had good numbers. How important is the technology spending that you've been doing in Markets leading to grabbing more wallet share in both Equity and FICC? I think it's critical. If you walk on the trading floor today, the deployment of technology are in the automated trading algorithms and swaps in FX and Equities. It's making its way into corporate  bonds (00:30:01), but I think it's critical you keep up with the technology in a very competitive business where market share matters. Our next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Great Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to step back and real big picture here. I mean, net interest income, you're already starting to see some pressure there. Just I think the general commentary in the industry is the banks are just under pressure seemingly almost everywhere. You've got to focus on expenses and yet you guys are still hitting returns on tangible of 18%. So just stepping back, I mean, you still have a couple billion to play with before you even start getting to that 17% long-term goal level. Like, what worries you about potentially pushing you under that 17% level? It just seems like even with all the pressures in the industry, you're still even exceeding it. Other than onetime credit events, really – I guess stepping back, what worries you about pushing the bank to that or even below that from your perspective? I think you're overdoing the pressures in the banking industry, okay, because we've had growth in United States for the better part of 10 years, and I'd say that the credit is extraordinarily good. So, if you look at consumer credit, commercial credit, wholesale, it's extraordinarily good. It can only get worse if you have a cycle. So, our 17% is – we always try to plan this through the cycle. We're at the over-earning part of the cycle in credit today. At one point we'd be the under-earning part on credit. And, of course, when you have a recession, it affects volumes and all these other things. So, that 17% is through the cycle and probably today not that bad. Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Thanks, and good morning. Good morning. I was – wanting to ask you two kind of different venues of questions. First is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter. Just wondering how much you had in premium amortization that was embedded in that. And then as you look at the interest bearing deposit cost, we didn't get much traction on the first cut, but did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the – going into the fourth quarter? Okay. Sure. So, first on securities yield, so that did play a role, Marty, but more importantly, the impact on securities yields came from mix and just lower rates overall. So, predominantly mix and lower rates and then to a lesser extent your point on prepaid, as well as a little bit of day count. And then on betas, broadly speaking, we say betas are symmetric. And so, if you look at the retail side as I said before, very little movement on a Fed ease and we did see rates paid even tick up a little bit there quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, there's obviously more opportunity to re-price, but we do that client-by-client and we're not going to lose valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And so, what we saw there as you might expect in CIB, rates paid down quarter-over-quarter and then we also saw rates paid down in both AWM and the Commercial Bank, but a little bit less so. And then would you see retail improving next quarter and then, Jamie, I wanted to talk to you about liquidity; two things, one, we saw the repo market and as you looked at Volcker and the liquidity-covered ratios, you've kind of taken the big banks out of participating in being able to solve for some of those liquidity issues. So, the Fed has kind of put a ring fence around just putting that all on their shoulders versus letting JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs or Bank of America jump in and help in those processes. And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that? Thanks. So, the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk-weighted – I think the advanced is far more important. And we should probably report more on that because that's at 13%. But when we're constrained by standardized, there are points in time when putting mortgages on your balance sheet just gives you a very low return. And, of course, you have a portfolio decision. You can sell it or put it in your balance sheet. If you sell it, you're going to probably reinvest in securities. So, it's a pure economic calculation, what gives you a better return. And that's why I think you need some fixing in the mortgage market about securitizations. Because I think we pointed out, if you had real good securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market. You can keep some of them in your balance sheet, you can sell some of the risk, and you wouldn't have to sell these mortgages, per se. And I do think and the liquidity – and we focus a little bit on liquidity at the  Federal Reserve account (00:35:03). We have $450 billion of cash, T-bills, repo, deposit at Fed. And there's always a bunch of certain constraints. And you want banks to have proper liquidity. But then I should also point out that those things go into multiple G-SIFI calculations, multiple other calculations. So, you try to calibrate across all those things and optimize across all those things. But I do think you are correct. The banks are at the point now where they will not be able to redeploy a big chunk of that $500 billion that we have in other markets when the time comes. It's not Volcker, per se. Volcker is a slightly different thing. And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter. We do think we'll continue to see deposit margin compression there on the retail side. We have come off the peaks in terms of CD pricing, but you still have slight migration there into interest bearing products. Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Jenn, you had mentioned earlier the point about that next year's earning asset growth will be led largely through deposits. But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the wealth management complex? Thanks. Sure. So, look, I think it's difficult to know. I think in a declining rate environment, as I said, I think the higher yielding alternatives are obviously less attractive for consumers. We do still see good organic growth in wholesale as well, in both Treasury Services and Securities Services. So, I think it's difficult to know. The macro environment will be a big determinant. Got it. Understood. And the second question, the Card revenue margin you mentioned, it's kind of flattened out. And I'm just wondering, can you first walk us through the NII versus fee components there? Is it partially because of an obvious NII challenge? Is there also any changes with regards to just the underlying card fee activity? Thanks. Yeah, there it's really just timing. There's just seasonality there. So, at Investor Day, we said that the Card revenue rate would be 11.50%, plus or minus. The fourth quarter is a seasonal high quarter for us, and so we do still expect to hit that 11.50%, plus or minus for the full year guidance, so just seasonality. And then the NII there doesn't have the same compression it does in deposits. Yes, very different dynamic there. Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Good morning. Just want to follow up on you talked about the fourth quarter net interest income just under $14 billion. And that's not a bad place to start for next year. You highlight balance sheet growth and mix and kind of some puts and takes, but it's probably not as bad as I think some would have thought, think about that $14 billion-ish as potential run rate, plus or minus. I'm just trying to better understand like what's the rate assumption that you have? And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that? So, we're doing that based on the latest implieds. And it's obviously early days. We're working through our budget process as we speak. So, it's based on the latest implieds, which have a cut in October and a cut in April, and 10-year, call it, 1.70%, plus or minus. So, relative to where we might have been just a couple of months ago, even weeks ago, it might have been a different outlook. So, I think it's important to take it with the health warning that it's on the latest implieds because that is of course what we know. And it's assuming some balance sheet growth. And it's assuming some... As opposed to all things being equal. That's right. That would be worse. That's right. It would be worse. Balance sheet growth as a partial offset to a larger impact from just rates. And what is the rate sensitivity at this point and how is that split between the short and long end? Thank you. There I would just say you can look at the earnings at risk that we'll have in the Q. I think that's probably the best way to think about it because that is not an NII sensitivity, but is an interest rate sensitivity. And so, that'll be out in a few weeks. Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Hi. Thanks for allowing my follow-up question. But, Jamie, this is the first earnings call we've had since the Business Roundtable came out with the new statement that it's not about shareholder-driven capitalism, it's about stakeholder-driven capitalism. And I was hanging out at the New Yorker Festival over the weekend, and your name came up. And at least one author said he spoke to you. And the real question is, what is the political and regulatory risk to JPMorgan's earnings as we look out over a year? You're having the presidential debates. Over the weekend, people talk about – and the politicians talk about a wealth tax, a transaction tax, a change in corporate tax, personal tax, basically, flattening the pyramid. And seems like a lot of people point their fingers at the banks, including JPMorgan. So, my question to you is what are you doing... Pointing their fingers at banks about what? Pointing the fingers at the banks about what? I think part of the cause, part of the cause of inequality in America. Banks should be doing more to help out the situation and, again, it's a whole – this is just one example. The way I saw this at the New Yorker Festival, this was kind of the intellectual underpinnings of a lot of the policies that are being introduced today. And so, you're seeing that in the politicians' statements about a wealth tax, changes to the bank business model, too much deregulation. And it's just an environment – I mean, here we are 10 years after the financial crisis, where what I would summarize it as very anti-bank. And I know JPMorgan's had proposals to help move the company and the country ahead. But how do you as head of the Business Roundtable help the industry and corporate America manage these concerns about income inequalities and these other topics that come up in the presidential debates? I know it's a big question. But, hey, you're in that role with the Business Roundtable. Okay. So, the Business Roundtable didn't get rid of shareholder value.  It basically says (00:41:39) shareholder value and customers and employees and communities, which essentially has been how many of these banks have been running for years. I think part of the statement was a lot of the world looked at shareholder value, and they hear rapacious profit-seeking, whereas most CEOs are thinking pretty long-term, building people, taking care of their employees, their customers. And we can highlight all the great things we do for employees,  huge (00:42:03) training, health, wellness, retirement, sharing the wealth inside the company. And we do, do all of that. And most of these companies do that. A lot of these larger companies, they're great community citizens when it comes to trying to participate and help and stuff like that. So, I do think – so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is. That environment changes politically. It changes economically. It changes geopolitically. But we're going to just navigate to do the best we can, serving our clients as best we can. And I do think that we try – and I'm speaking for a lot of  clients (42:40) who try to do a tremendous amount to help the communities because there have been people left behind. The inner-city schools are not failing because of banks. Okay? And infrastructure is not failing because of banks. So, I think we can help build infrastructure, help train people, get more skills, get involved in education systems, like all the kind of stuff that a lot of us all do in Detroit, we could lift up society. And I think it's good for us to lift up the society. And when society does better, everyone does better. If you don't believe me, look at Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, North Korea, et cetera, that doing well is a good thing for society and you could share the wealth a little bit. So, I'm not going to respond to specific political statements out there, but we'll do our part to be a great community citizen and serve our shareholders at the same time. All right. Well, thanks for that response. So, can I put words in your mouth? I mean doing well for your communities and employees and all the other stakeholders is good for the shareholders long-term. Is that... Yes. And, Mike, I actually give examples in the crisis, about the amount of people that we've financed at prices way below the market. Were we doing that to make rapacious profit seeking? No. That included states, cities, hospitals, businesses, our consumers, et cetera. And so, you weren't being repaid, but our attitude was no, we're going to help our clients get through this tough time. And what is it about our profitability? Our profitability dropped dramatically and we were fine. I think that was long-term thinking. We never got sued over that. And same for how we do employees. We're constantly investing in employees and branches and jobs and training. That stuff will benefit three years out, five years out, 10 years out, 20 years out. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Great. Thanks. Quick question on equity trading, I know you gave an update on what you thought the revenues would come in in mid-September and it looks like they came in worse than what you were looking for. Is there a way to break out what was the impact of potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues? Sure. In Equity Derivatives, it was a combination of weaker client activity and some losses on inventory, but it wasn't meaningful. Those losses were certainly not meaningful in the grand scheme of things, but they were part of the equity derivative story. But there wasn't any other additional investments in there that had marks on them impacting the numbers? No. No. Okay. And then separately on CECL, I know you've been doing parallel runs as all banks have been. Are you at the point now where you can kind of give what the pro forma provision would be for CECL? Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date? So, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion. We've done a ton of work as you say and a lot of modeling. The range is still between $4 billion and $6 billion. And we'll be able to be more precise obviously as we prepare for the January 1 implementation. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Hi. Thanks. One follow up on the Equity. I mean, I know DB [Deutsche Bank] books were in the market and I believe that you were a winner of some of that. Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q? That was some prime balance that I think you're referring to and I don't know the answer to that. It was not in – it's not meaningful. It's not meaningful, yeah. Wherever it is. Okay. All right. And then separately, there's been some news obviously on discount brokers cutting commissions to zero. I know you have You Invest and that's a recent launch. But how do you think about how that impacts your business model? Is it just something that you would consider is specific to You Invest or do you think that that's something that would have a bigger impact and potentially more optionality for your clients across your wealth spectrum? So, the majority of our customers in You Invest already trade for free, and so we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. As we think about You Invest, it is one component of our broader investment strategy. And as I said, we're really proud of this quarter's results with client investment assets being up 13%. It was an important product launch for us in terms of meeting an unmet need with our existing customers, but we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. Yeah, we're strengthening You Invest. We still are improving the product over time. We haven't done a tremendous amount of marketing. Kind of want to get it all right both You Invest and You Invest Portfolios, and then we'll figure out all the exact, specific pricing around it. And we have no further questions at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect."

         "Q3 2019 Earnings Call",
         "Welcome to the Texas Capital Bancshares Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode during the presentation. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Heather Worley, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the TCBI third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'm Heather Worley, Director of Investor Relations. Before we begin, please be aware this call will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations of future results or events. Forward-looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ material from these statements. Our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this call, and we do not assume any obligation to update or revise them. Statements made on this call should be considered together with the cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release, our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent filings with the SEC. We will refer to slides during today's presentation, which can be found along with the press release in the Investor Relations section of our website at texascapitalbank.com. Our speakers for the call today are Keith Cargill, President and CEO; and Julie Anderson, CFO. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, our operator, Andrea, will facilitate a Q&A session. And now I will turn the call over to Keith, who will begin on slide 3 of the webcast. Thank you, Heather. I will open, then Julie will give her assessment for Q3. I will close before opening the lines for Q&A. Let's begin on slide 3. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter in multiple key areas. Deposit growth was excellent, credit improved, controllable core expenses were up only modestly, mortgage finance was strong, core LHI grew on average, despite the significant paydowns we accomplished in leveraged loans. Net revenue grew linked quarter and year-over-year. Earnings per share grew 13% linked quarter and 3% year-over-year. Outstanding results from an extraordinary effort by our truly talented team across Texas Capital Bank, and these excellent financial results were accomplished through executing our strategic initiatives to drive continued improvement in deposits, fees, efficiency, and an even more differentiated premier client experience. I'm a fortunate CEO indeed to work with amazing talent, who wake up each morning excited to build the premier business and private bank in America. It is an aspiration we all own and expect to achieve in time. Julie? Thanks, Keith. My comments will cover slide 6 through 13. Net interest income increased $8.6 million, or 3.5% from the second quarter, and is up $20 million or 8.6% from the third quarter last year, continuing to demonstrate the resiliency of our balance sheet in the existing rate environment. Mortgage finance has acted as a very effective hedge in an inverted or close to inverted yield curve scenario. Despite the fact that our NIM decreased on a linked quarter basis, it's important to understand that it was primarily related to the earning asset shift, specifically mortgage finance and liquidity. Honestly, we don't believe NIM is the best metric to assess relative profitability or future revenue generation in this rate environment. Traditional LHI yields were down, which is reflective of the continued decline in LIBOR. Fees were slightly higher in the third quarter and are comparable to Q1 level, but remain at levels meaningfully lower than we experienced in most of 2018. Our mortgage warehouse yields were down on a linked quarter basis, and similar to last quarter, the decline is not related to any shift in competitive pressures, but rather resulted from volume pricing that was already in place. And when we refer to volumes, that means loan volumes as well as deposits, both of which are positive for net interest income. Our MCA yields continue to be pressured, which was expected compared to actual mortgage rate. We continue to have growth in deposits, with growth in interest-bearing as well as non-interest bearing. Overall deposit costs decreased by 8 basis points from 129 basis points in the second quarter to 121 basis points in the third quarter. The decrease resulted from continued growth in DDAs, as well as meaningful decreases in interest-bearing deposit costs. Our total funding costs were down 15 basis points with decreased usage of FHLB borrowings. We continue to have a solid deposit pipeline with some of the verticals getting traction. The launch of our Escrow vertical went public during the quarter and more to come in the next few months about other high-potential verticals. Recent sensitivity simulations indicate that net interest income would decline approximately 6% to 9%, assuming 75 basis points of additional rate cuts over the next 12 months. This assumes that certain floors would kick in, as well as assumptions related to continued elevated mortgage finance volumes over the forecast horizon. We had a slight increase in average traditional LHI during the quarter, but balances were down as of period-end; that's consistent with the continued runoff in our leveraged portfolio. Traditional LHI average balances were down 1% from second quarter and up 3% from this time last year. The level of overall payoffs continue to be high, primarily in CRE, where we're continuing to replace runoff with fundings on existing commitments and some new originations. In contrast, the C&I leveraged runoff is not being backfilled. Payoffs in C&I leverage are in line with what we expected, and we would expect to see further reductions in the fourth quarter. Again, we had a strong average total mortgage finance balances, including MCA, driven by the seasonally strong quarter, which, similar to the second quarter, was even stronger with lower mortgage rates. Average balances are up from this time last year by 54%. We would expect fourth quarter volumes to be strong with a continued low rate. We continued to experience good growth in linked quarter average total deposits, with the mix of interest-bearing as well as non-interest bearing. Our slower core loan growth is and will continue to be beneficial to our marginal cost of funding. We continue to see improvements in deposit mix, with some contribution from verticals, as well as from existing clients, including mortgage finance escrow account. We would expect that to continue with meaningful improvement more evident in 2020, as verticals get more traction and we continue to deepen existing relationships. Overall, 8 basis points linked quarter improvement in our deposit costs, and 15 basis points improvement in total funding costs, with less reliance on FHLB borrowings. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were down 6 basis points, but excluding CDs, which are mostly brokered CDs, our interest-bearing deposits were down 9 basis points on a linked quarter basis. As we've mentioned, indexed deposits have an assumed 100% beta, while all other interest-bearing is assumed to be closer to 65%. Our playbook for stepping down rate was in place prior to the July move. We're being cautious but very proactive in applying rate reductions across the board. We expect repricing to remain at a similar level or perhaps faster for the next one to two Fed moves. As for brokered deposits, they remain at $2.1 billion. With increasingly favorable pricing, the selective use of brokered CDs remains an option to supplement the funding stack, as we gain traction in the new deposit-focused vertical. We continue to show positive trends in our core operating expenses, specifically looking at the changes in salaries and employee benefits, which represents over 50% of our total non-interest expense. Third quarter salaries and employee benefits were up less than 4% from the third quarter last year. And year-to-date, the increase is a little over 5%, levels that are unprecedented in our history. And we're doing it at a time when we are focused on transformational changes in how we think about efficiency and client experience. We're being very deliberate with revenue-generating hires and are continuing to attract exceptional talent as our story continues to be extremely compelling. We've discussed marketing expenses and the variable portion tied to deposit. About a third of the increase in that category this quarter was related to the variable portion. That expense peaked in Q3, as we're not focused on growth in that category of deposits. The remainder of the increase was normal business development, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but is not a significant part of the total expense. Third quarter included an MSR impairment of $2.6 million, and that's compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter and $2.9 million in the first quarter, so a total of over $8 million of  (00:09:31) expenses negatively affecting total non-interest expense for the year. We are in the process of putting instruments in place that will protect us from future downside risk with the MSR portfolio, assuming rates continue to fall. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was elevated to 54.8% and was really related to a couple of MCA items, all of which are rate related and have been offset in net revenue, either this quarter or in prior quarters. The classifications of several of the MCA items, as well as the marketing costs related to deposit have been punitive to our efficiency ratio. If servicing costs were netted in non-interest income against servicing revenue and the related marketing fees were moved to interest expense, our efficiency would have been consistently in the 50% to 51% range and would show an improvement year-to-date 2019 compared to 2018. We believe a more representative measure to focus on in evaluating our non-interest expense trends is non-interest expense to average earning assets, which has improved from 2.15% in the third quarter of 2018 to 1.86% in this quarter. We are pleased with certain improvements in our credit in the third quarter, namely, our provision level, as well as the decrease in total criticized net of the charge-offs. Our non-accrual levels are still at a relatively low level of 0.49% of total LHI. Net charge-offs for the quarter are primarily related to energy and leveraged, specifically, $17 million in energy and $20 million in leveraged. Similarly, year-to-date charge-offs of $61 million are comprised of $32 million in energy and $24 million in leveraged. All of the quarter's charge-offs were related to existing problem credits that we've discussed in previous quarters. Additionally, we experienced a meaningful decrease in total criticized levels in the third quarter, and that's directly reflective of the actions taken over the past few quarters in actively managing each of these credits. Our total criticized as a percentage of total LHI remains low and dropped to 2.2% this quarter compared to 2.6% in the second quarter. For all criticized loan relationships, we continue to be engaged and are forecasting additional pay-downs in the fourth quarter. We had a meaningful drop in provision to $11 million, from $27 million in the second quarter. Loans being charged off already had certain reserves allocated. Earlier in the year, we expected a larger portion of provision in the first half of the year and our actions have translated into achieving that. There will still be resolutions to existing credits and there could be migration within the criticized book, but we do believe there are enough offsets in those forecasted recoveries of provision for us to lower our full-year guidance. We continue to be focused on crisp management of the problem credits, primarily in leveraged and energy, to minimize downside impact, and we're actively monitoring all portfolios in light of macroeconomic factors. Turning to the quarterly highlights, our continued strength in linked quarter net revenue despite the punishing rate environment that's resulting from our strong volumes in mortgage finance, which have continued to contribute in a meaningful way to the increase. First quarter and second quarter non-interest income had $8.5 million and $6.5 million related to a legal settlement which was not recurring in the third quarter, and that was the main driver of the decrease on a linked quarter basis. We continue to have some noise in the loss on sale of loans line in non-interest income, which has primarily resulted from holding MCA loans longer, which increases the hedging cost and has offset an additional spread income. This quarter, that line also included an additional increase reserve component related to a spike in early loan payoffs resulting from refinance activity. We're continuing to improve run rate on core operating expense items. Year over year, 8% increase in non-interest expense compared to prior-year Q3, excluding ROE recovery of last year. Excluding the increases in marketing related to deposit cost and the increases in servicing related to impairments, the year over year, as well as year-to-date comparisons are 4% to 5%, which, again, is unprecedented in our history and represents a significant improvement in managing our core operating expenses. ROE and ROA levels were improved in the third quarter as a result of the lower provision for loan losses. Our ROA levels will continue to be negatively impacted by the higher mortgage finance and liquidity balances. Loan loss provision levels will continue to be key to driving improved ROE. Now, we'll turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2019. We're maintaining our guidance for average traditional LHI growth at mid-single digit percent growth. This is reflective of the growth we experienced earlier in the year and incorporates our current focus of positioning our balance sheet to be as strong as possible as we head into what could be a challenging point in this cycle. We're increasing our guidance for average mortgage finance growth to mid to high-30s, from low to mid-20s percent. That takes into consideration the additional growth so far this year and an expected strong Q4. Obviously, this is the lowest risk category for us, so we're happy to exploit the opportunities available with lower mortgage rates, even if it means temporary dilution to some of our performance metrics. No changes to our MCA guidance of $2.5 billion for average outstandings. MCA will continue to benefit from the additional volumes with lower rates. We're increasing our guidance for average total deposits to high-teens percent growth, from low-double digit percent growth, reflective of the DDA growth that we experienced in the second and third quarters. We're decreasing our guidance for NIM to 3.2% to 3.3%. That's down from 3.5% to 3.45%. The decrease is driven primarily by the earning asset shift we've experienced and we'll continue to have from the total mortgage finance, which is relatively lower yielding asset. While punitive to NIM, the  average growth (00:15:54) is very positive to net revenue and offset some of the impact from rate decreases. Our guidance assumes no Fed changes in rates, as the probabilities for those continue to move dramatically from week to week. However, it's important to understand how we believe rate cuts will affect us and we're focused on it in terms of net interest income, which will be negatively affected by future rate decreases. As I noted earlier, the decrease to net interest income could be 6% to 9% over the next 12 months, assuming 75 basis points of additional rate cut. Our guidance for net revenue remains at high-single digit percent growth. Because of the lower level of provision in third quarter, coupled with continued relationship-specific strategies on our leveraged lending and energy portfolios, we're reducing our guidance for provision expense to high-60s to high-70s, and that's down from mid to high-80s. Our guidance for non-interest expense remains at mid-single digit to high-single digit percent growth. As we've noted, we continue to feel very good about the slowing of our core operating expenses but the impact of MSR impairment charges, as well as the variable marketing costs, have driven upward pressure on the range. Our guidance for efficiency ratio remains in the low-50s. Lastly, we'll turn to our longer-term outlook. These are the right goals and we're committed to achieving them, but the timeline will be more challenging in the existing rate environment. As you know, the initiatives we have in place are focused on repositioning our balance sheet to be more stable through rate cycle, but certainly, there can be variability at different points in that cycle. We are confident that we have the right initiatives underway for the long-term. Historically, we have been very successful at repositioning as needed and we expect similar success this time. Keith? Thank you, Julie. We are committed to delivering an even more premier differentiated client experience to our current business and private clients, while developing new best-of-class specialized industry verticals. Elevating our client experience delivery and opening new specialized industry businesses will create untapped opportunities to attract clients in a more favorable ROE and self-funding categories, helping us overcome with growth some of the shrinkage we continue to experience deliberately in our leveraged lending. Mortgage finance continues to give our company a high performance growth engine with essentially US government credit risk. This business allows us to grow net interest income despite late cycle challenges in pricing and structure and other core LHI categories. It also provides significant self-funding through the mortgage finance treasury management deposits, and the fee income from the mortgage finance business covers our cost of operating the business. Beyond the success of the mortgage finance deposit growth, we have seen strong growth in core C&I treasury management deposits, as well as early growth in some of our new deposit verticals. In combination, the core treasury deposits and new deposit vertical funding has grown by over $1 billion so far in 2019. Our final two deposit verticals launching in the first quarter of 2020 are expected to be the most significant new deposit growth initiatives of all. We are bullish on our deposit growth prospects for the next few years as these verticals mature, and our bankers and treasury management partners drive increased core treasury growth, as well as cross-sell new deposit vertical products. It was most encouraging to see not only loan loss provision decline meaningfully, but also to see a significant decline in criticized classified loans. The credit team, loan review team, relationship managers and their group heads have all worked as one team for the past year to understand the loan portfolio at a deep granular level and de-risk the portfolio before an eventual economic slowdown sometime in the future. Their hard work continues and we expect to deliver an improving trend for several quarters ahead. We are seeing significant improvement in process efficiencies and the resulting improvement in more responsive client service and lower core operating expense growth. We are working diligently and with confidence to deliver a great long-term investment for our shareholders and premier service and products for our clients. Operator, if you would, let's please open the lines for Q&A. And our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, guys. I think the first question, Keith, just based on feedback I've received over the last one hour, would love to get a little more color on credit and how we should read you lowering the provisioning guide. Would love to get in terms of your comfort on migration chance and the leveraged lending, the energy book and the just the risk of like things, again, surprising to the downside three or six months of now. If you could talk to that, that would be helpful. Well, we're encouraged. It's early to declare a victory but we really believe we have a much deeper understanding, Ebrahim, of our portfolio and not just leveraged lending and energy than certainly we had a year ago, and it's taken a tremendous amount of work by all of the groups I mentioned, our loan review team, credit team, our bankers, our group heads. Everyone has really pitched in, and it is most encouraging to me that we're seeing this this trend is tipping down that's meaningful linked quarter. But we need to put two or three of these together and I believe we will. It's taken a while to be confident that we really have our arms around the portfolio, but I believe we are in that kind of situation. And things can happen on a given credit, in a given 90 days. So again, I'm not here to declare victory but I do believe we're on the right path and we're going to see hopefully multiple success of quarters with the right trends, not just one. Got it. And is it fair to assume that the quarter end included other banks have talked about their SNC exam having an impact? Is all of that reflected? Yes, it did include that. In fact, we had no surprises on the SNC exam. Our team was on top of it. And so, that came out just fine for us. Perfect. And just moving on to in terms of capital, when we look at TCE, I mean, in the high-7s, just talk to us in terms of how you're thinking about how low can capital ratios go or just your strategy around participation of the mortgage warehouse loans and how CECL, if at all, may impact capital ratios toward the end of the year? So we talked about – Ebrahim, I think we've talked about earlier in the quarter that we're comfortable with taking advantage of what we're getting with the warehouse growth. And so, we're comfortable with doing additional participation. We ended the quarter participation – the participation commitments were a little over $1 billion. So, we're comfortable with that. We want to make sure that we can continue to take good care of our clients. So, we're comfortable with that TCE ratio that's comfortable for us. We're very comfortable with that. CECL, we're not saying too much about CECL. I guess what I would say is what we have said in the past, that for commercially-focused institutions like ourselves, we don't expect a material change in our overall provisioning. So, I think that we're comfortable with that. By the way, Ebrahim, that move in what we had in actual funded participations at second quarter end versus third quarter end was close to $0.5 billion. So, we could have taken that on balance sheet but we're being very disciplined to take care of clients without putting it all on balance sheet, and I think that's the right move. Had we put it on balance sheet, it would've been about a 23% growth linked quarter. But I think we're doing the right thing to have a strong business but also to manage it and not let it all grow on balance sheet. Got it. And then, if I can sneak in one last question. Demand deposit growth was extremely strong. Is that sustainable, like do you expect to hang on to these balances as we look into the fourth quarter? And have you seen any early results from the one or two big deposit verticals that are either online or in the process of coming online? Yeah. We're very encouraged by what we're doing with our deposit verticals and our core treasury efforts. Our bankers have done just as we asked and really taking their partners, their treasury partners far more on calls and we're filling in some of the gaps in relationships where we only had loan relationships, and that's really contributing along with our new deposit verticals, as I mentioned, just this year. In nine months, we're up over $1 billion in those two categories. We don't want to drill down a lot at this point but I think you could tell, it's – there is always seasonality that comes from our mortgage warehouse deposits and we experienced it in the second quarter, and again, in the third. But I wanted you to also hear about that north of $1 billion growth that came from verticals and also just core treasury growth, which is awesome to have alongside those seasonal balances. Hey, Ebrahim, typically, we can see some seasonality and some downward impact from seasonality in our deposits in the fourth quarter and the first quarter... Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. ...primarily in DDA. Our next question comes from Brady Gailey of KBW. Please go ahead. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Hello, Brady. Hey, Brady. So I mean, the mortgage warehouse and MCA combined continue to perform really nicely here, I mean, it's up again off a strong 2Q. It feels like we're getting close to the levels where you start hitting concentration limits. I forgot exactly how you all look at it, but I know you have a limit out there. I mean, has MCA and the warehouse continues to be robust and potentially grow from here. Will most of those balances move into the participation program you have through other banks or is there still capacity to let the balances grow on Texas Capital's balance sheet? Well, as we move into the fourth quarter, while the volumes will be very good compared to most seasonally softer fourth quarters, I don't anticipate it being higher. And so, I don't believe that's going to impact this, Brady, in the fourth or first quarters. And as we grow the overall balance sheet between now and the second quarter next year, I think we'll be fine and in good shape and not have to lay off all of the growth once we get a couple of quarters down the road. All right. And then, one more on credit, if you look at non-performing loans, they were up. They're pretty much stable, up a little bit linked quarter. The net charge-offs obviously would naturally reduce that. So, maybe just talk about any sort of inflows into the NPL bucket in the quarter? There was one energy deal and that – that's the – that was the bogey that got us slightly over. I think it was like $2 million higher, as I recall, from prior quarter overall on NPA. Still quite modest NPA sales. All right. Great. Thank you, guys. You're welcome. Thanks. Our next question comes from Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hello, Brett. Hi, Brett. I wanted just to go back to, Julie, the NII guidance and the 6% to 9% downside for 75 basis points. Can you just talk about how you're modeling that in terms of the verticals for growing deposits, how the mortgage warehouse factors into that, as presumably, that decline, it would seem like you have a net benefit to the margin? Can you just walk through the modeling for how you're doing downside for  bad debts (00:29:33)? Sure. So, we're focused on net interest income because you're right, there's going to be some variability in NIM with mortgage net balances. I'd said we're assuming 100% beta on the indexed deposit and 65% on the other interest bearing. But that also assumes that mortgage finance growth still continues to be pretty strong, not elevated but certainly still strong over that four-quarter horizon. Okay. And then, wanted to talk about the LHI growth for a second. As you overcome the declines in leveraged lending, I'm just thinking about like the growth path for the next year or so. I mean, does that improve notably or can you give us any additional color on like kind of how you see that trending once you've gotten past running down some of the leveraged book and then obviously not growing energy as well? We're really encouraged about a couple of new corporate verticals that we're looking at that are full-blown lending and deposit verticals. So, these would be separate from the deposit vertical initiatives we launched a year and a half ago. And we have a team that's close to us announcing that will launch the first of those verticals. So, we'll be able to talk about that in January. And I'm very optimistic that with that new vertical, with our – some new talent we've been able to bring to the company in our overall C&I business, both in Houston and Dallas, that we're going to be able to more than backfill. It's just too early to give you that guidance for next year, but I'm very encouraged they will be even more diversified, certainly with lower risk growth than what we experienced the last few years when we were growing leveraged lending. So, I will have more for you in January but we have yet another two corporate verticals we're contemplating to launch at some point in 2020. And between those three, I believe that we're going to have some good solid, diversified, appropriate risk growth in our book. Okay. Great. Appreciate all the color. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, everybody. Hello, Steve. Hey, Steve. I wanted to start on the new margin guidance. Is my math correct, because the midpoint of the new guidance seems to imply a NIM in the 2.70% range for the fourth? No, no, but we do expect NIM – I mean, that's why we try to focus on net interest income, obviously, but we do expect NIM with the continued success in mortgage finance. It could take down – it would take down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and that would also still – that would also factor in the full extent of the September move, but not that low. So, what is – just so we're clear, what is the range that you expect NIM to come down in the final quarter? The range that we updated was the 3.25% – 3.20% to 3.30% is the full year. That's the update for the full year, 3.20% to 3.30%. Okay. Just looking where you started 2019, it seems to imply a pretty dramatic reduction in NIM coming again in 4Q. Like do you expect the pressure to be pretty consistent with what you reported this quarter? We think – I mean, I would expect the fourth quarter to still be in the low-3. Okay. Got you. Okay. Can you remind me, for your mortgage finance loans, they carry a lower yield than peers, which are just in the mortgage warehouse business, right? First Horizon reported 5.3% yield. Just maybe why your yield is so much lower than just the mortgage warehouse business? We really focused, Steve, on the QM business. Now, we have a little non-QM, but other competitors are more comfortable with non-QM than we are. And so that's the primary difference. Okay. Got you. Okay. And then, just finally, I'm trying to make sense of this very strong deposit growth. I know Ebrahim asked the question. When we look at non-interest bearing and savings deposit growth, why were they both so strong this quarter? I mean, it was really off-the-charts growth? It's primarily from existing clients, some related to mortgage finance and then some related to sort of our core clients. It was primarily – there was some – there was also some – Keith mentioned there were some impact from some of the verticals but most of it was from existing clients. Got you. And... (00:34:47) ...Steve, we grew so fast the last five years. We had some gaps where we did not gather up the treasury relationship. And so, we've really been focused on that and it's bearing fruit and it's really helping us along with the new verticals. Okay. And now that you have this liquidity, do you plan to keep the loan-to-deposit ratio below 100? We'll assess the liquidity levels that we have. Obviously, we've had some outside success in the last couple of quarters in deposit generation. We've reduced what we're borrowing. That still leaves us with quite a bit of liquidity. So, we will assess that. There will also be some seasonality in some of our deposits, primarily in DDA. We'll see some seasonality in the fourth quarter. So, we'll take all of that forecasting into assessment on what we're going to do with liquidity levels. And we're really looking any way we can at replacing higher cost of funding, too, Steve. Right. So, like the brokered deposits over time, we're going to be in a better position to take that out and improve our NIM. Okay. Terrific. Thanks for taking my questions. You're welcome. Sure. Thank you. And our next question will come from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I want to stick with the deposit discussion. And Julie, you mentioned downward pressure on deposit balances due to seasonality in the fourth quarter. If I look at the full-year guidance, I think it implies that the balances in the fourth quarter will drop pretty considerably, like 9% or 10%. Can you just confirm that I'm thinking about that right for the fourth quarter deposit balance? As you know, we try to be conservative with our guidance. So, we do expect some seasonality impact on deposits. We would – we try to set that guidance so that it is conservative. I guess that's how we'd leave it. And Matt, with the continued strong volume in warehouse along with that, it does help offset the normal seasonality on the deposit side, too, because you – they're building their mortgage servicing book, and so, that helps keep it a little higher and more stable. But we also look at historical seasonality and we try to take what we know today, along with historical, and give you a more conservative guidance. Got it. Okay. And I think going back to, I think, with Brady's question previously on the migration of loans from criticized into non-accrual, I think I see the migration that you had mentioned, Keith, on the energy portfolio, but it also looks like there was some negative migration in the leveraged lending book. Non-accruals were flat there but there were still some higher charge-offs in the third quarter. Any color you could tell us about that book? Yeah. We really have been able to address those charge-offs in prior quarters and built that provision, which we all know was pretty hard on us the first half of the year. But we're seeing the overall criticized classified tip down, and then, within that, I really think we're seeing improvements in the classified. So, it's not simply a matter of the criticized, which we got on the radar in the first quarter with these deep-dives we've been taking on our loan portfolio over the last four quarters, it's also that the actual classified component that's very encouraging at this point. So, yes, there were a couple right at – toward quarter end but the overall trend of migration, we think, is favorable going into the fourth. Got it. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to something that you said earlier in the call around expenses. Julie, I think you said the way you guys are looking at it now is expenses to average assets. Is that correct? And if so, do you have kind of thoughts? It's obviously come down, but do you have thoughts kind of around how we should think about that moving forward? No, I mean, we haven't given any guidance on that. And that's something that's – Michael, that's a thoughtful question, and we'll certainly think about that. I guess we just – as we struggle with trying to explain how we really are doing a much better job on the core operating expenses, just non-interest expense to average earning assets just seems like a more representative metric of our progress. So, we haven't given any guidance on that. I mean, I think we still – we feel comfortable that that's going to continue to improve, but we haven't given any specific guidance on it. Excuse me, Julie. Sure. I might add, Michael. Over time, this gap between efficiency ratio, as Julie's described measuring it and the traditional way we measure it, they will – those lines will cross or meet, and that will be as we replace some of these marketing expense deposits. Those marketing expenses are what really throw us and make it hard to give you metrics that are comparable to other peers. But again, that's one of the key things we're working on is lowering overall cost of funding, including those marketing expenses. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just going back to the margin, not to beat a dead horse here, but I think the guidance you said doesn't include any future rate cuts this year. Looks like the futures are implying we get one – one-month LIBOR is already down 14 basis points this quarter. Is that kind of all – at least the drop in LIBOR, is that contemplated in the outlook and why that perhaps the range is so big? And then if we do get a rate cut in October, December, would the dynamics around the stats that you quoted before in terms of the impact on NII, would that shift at all? Thanks. So what would already be factored into the guidance is where we ended the quarter, right? Those loans, how they had repriced, was level at the end of the quarter, that would be included in the guidance. And then what we've assumed in that, the sensitivities that I gave you, what we've assumed is that there's another 75 basis points, we assumed that that could be in October move and December, and then again in June for that 12 months, that 12-month sensitivity. Does that help? Okay. That's – yeah, that's  (00:42:21)... And then as we've mentioned, of course you have the 100% beta on the institutional funding, and then we're projecting a 65% beta on our other interest-bearing thing. Okay. Maybe just one more separate question on energy, I know it's been a topic of a lot of calls so far. You guys spoke last year, last summer, that you guys had seen some issues back then, and the thought process was you were getting ahead of it and were going to be perhaps first out of the chute. Do you still kind of feel that way, and maybe just as it relates to energy, why do you think we're seeing the issues that we're seeing now when oil prices are still pretty healthy? Thanks. I do think we're as ahead of it as anyone, and I say that because the market, the capital market, is just kind of locked up right now. And that is causing some of the stress on some of the energy companies that were not geared to be full-blown operating energy companies. It was more of a acquisition play when they thought prices were low and new capital came into that space, with the intention of proving up some of the unproven property that they acquired with drilling programs. And now they realize they're going to have to be generating drilling programs that are cash flow positive, because the capital markets aren't active. And so they don't have access to the capital to have robust drilling programs. So I think it's just in that state where it's difficult to call how long we might be in this mode of them working their way through it. But I do think we're more on top of the portfolio certainly than many banks, and we had to be because it's something we've done at Texas Capital our entire history, but most of us who are involved in the credit process at the company have done this 35, 40 years. These cycles, every single one, is unique, and you learn from each one but you have to be so aggressive in looking at each deal and each operator. We're much more thoughtful now about looking more carefully at drilling plans, Michael, because some of the, again, operating knowhow, with all that capital flowing in, was getting pushed to do some outlying drilling to try and elevate the price of the overall property. And by doing that, they took some more risks than they should have. I think we've identified who those are, and it's more a matter with the rest of the portfolio just grinding through this period where they have challenging access to capital. And I mean challenging access to any capital, because as banks, we're looking so carefully at our borrowing bases that we're taking a lot of the cash flow that they had hoped they'd be able to deploy in new drilling activity. But in order to be sure we keep our borrowing bases in line, we're having to capture more of that cash flow on debt paydowns. So it's not simply a matter of equity capital that's kind of in a wait-and-see mode, but also debt capital that they're having a challenging time to find. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color, Keith. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Hello. Jon. Hi, Jon. Hey, couple of near-term and then longer-term question, but earning assets, a bit up quite nicely in Q2 and Q3, and I'm just curious if you feel like Q4 earning assets can be up again. So it depends on warehouse volumes, and so we think they'll be good. I don't know that they're going to be up, because fourth quarter is seasonally a little slower. So I don't know Keith, I wouldn't say that would be up. Well, we are still overcoming, on the net growth side, Jon, the bleeding down, the shrinking and de-risking of our balance sheet with the leveraged lending portfolio. And so actually, we're really quite optimistic that we'll have an even bigger paydown in leveraged lending than we had on average the last three quarters. So, if that occurs, then you just have to make up that 100-plus million dollars roughly in order to get back to zero. And so I think it will be a modest growth, if any growth, in the fourth quarter. But I don't think that you have to drill down to see if that's good. I think it may be good because we are de-risking our balance sheet. Yeah. Okay, okay. That makes sense. It's just another way to think about the margin equation. My assumption would be flat to down, and I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. I think that's correct. I think you are. Yeah. Okay. On the provision, appreciate the fact that that came down, but it's still – there's still about a $10 million swing factor in terms of the high and low level of the range. Just curious if you're leaning one way or the other, I know that's – a lot of this kind of depends on what happens at year-end, but how are you feeling about it right now? Well, I can tell you, I'm leaning more to the low, and some of my cohorts a little more to being safe on the high. But I think collectively, we agree on this range, and I'm still hopeful we'll come in in the high-60s or low-70s. But I think our team feels like we certainly can come in within the range. There's a small group in the room and it's probably 50/50, so we've all agreed – again, we all agree that we feel comfortable with the range. Okay. All right. And then I hate to go back to this, but this 6% to 9% decline in NII on the 75 basis points, the first part of the question is, what are you assuming in terms of growth? Is this just a static balance sheet or are you assuming like a normal course of business to get to that number? These are normal forecast in 12-month balance sheet. So it would assume that warehouse is still pretty strong, but then we wouldn't see any reason why it wouldn't stay strong. Again, the leverage, some of the continued paydown in leverage, but as Keith said, in a couple of quarters from some of these new areas of growth, we would expect some growth. So it's our normal 12-month forecast. And again, even if the market, and we anticipate the market next year, Jon, being somewhat softer than this year, we won't be doing linked quarter laying off of $0.5 billion of the warehouse volume. And so that gives us that shock absorber capability as we manage how much we take on balance sheet, so that if we do see some backing off slightly next year on mortgage warehouse volumes, we still feel good about being able to take market share and grow it slightly. And on the deposit side, it does include some more deposits from some of the new verticals. That's right. More meaningful than we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Okay. And then the last thing, maybe this is an obvious question, but I'm assuming that the last cut would take the biggest bite. So for example, if we get only 25 basis points and the Fed is done, that that's not a terrible outcome for you, but when we get to 50 or 75 basis points, that's where the biggest bite comes in terms of the NII guide. I don't necessarily think so. Yeah. I'm very optimistic about our deposit trends... Yeah. ...and our new verticals. But also just our core treasury trends, it won't be easy and we're going to have to be better than we've ever been, even though we've been really good this year on core expenses. I really feel good about what we can do overall on our expense and efficiency next year. So, yes, on the spread, it won't be easy, but I don't think it will be as challenging as certainly if we hadn't done these initiatives two years ago and be into the process now with launching these biggest deposit initiatives in the next quarter or so. Hey, Jon, something else that's important to remember is what happened with our deposits on the way up. We moved up really fast with a really high beta, which means we have a lot more to come down. So the indexed deposits alone will continue to come down, and then in addition as we continue to replace some of the higher-cost deposits with some of these new verticals. So we feel like we have a lot more runway on the deposits coming down. But we're not naïve. I mean... Absolutely. ...it's a meaningful headwind and we're certainly doing our planning around expenses and all accordingly. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey, good evening. Hello, Brad. Hey, Brad. Hey, Julie, just to follow up on the warehouse. Just curious, of the 26-basis-point decline yield on the warehouse this quarter, how much of that relates to volume discount versus just the move in LIBOR? I just want to get a sense, as volumes may weaken as you move into 2020 a little bit versus the high this quarter, kind of can you recover any of that lost yield on the warehouse? (00:52:22) answer that. I mean... Some of it's driven by volume discounts with these top clients, and so they've been coming in with such robust volumes. That certainly has contributed, but it's mostly LIBOR. Yeah. Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm sorry if I missed this. Relatively small numbers, but there was also an uptick in the loans 90 days past due kind of ex the impact of premium finance customers, just kind of curious to me, any additional color there on kind of what the driver was? No, just a couple of bigger deals but not ones that we feel uncomfortable with. Just some documentation things, things that didn't get done, so nothing that's good of any consequence that we're concerned about migrating to a loan book category. But we're not happy it didn't get done... That's correct. ...on the documentation. But... Correct. ...we don't have concern about the credits. Got it. All right. Thank you, guys. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. I just want to follow up on the expense question. I know you're not going to give specific guidance, but can you just talk about big picture maybe some opportunities to maybe lower the expense growth rate next year? We're looking at all things that we can leverage, including the technology investing we've been doing, Peter, for the last three years. And that is beginning to show some opportunity, where we can, in fact, hire fewer new people. That's been the case this year. I think it will continue to give us opportunity to leverage that technology as we go into the New Year. We're doing some really incredible work around process reengineering and finding again that we can lift the value of our people that have been doing work not as valuable as they are capable of doing, by automating some of the things that are more rudimentary. And we're looking at deploying bots to give us 24/7 capabilities to do some of that rudimentary work, and looking at a number of different opportunities. So, thankfully, we have worked hard to get our technology grid in good shape up to date over the last three years, and now we're able to begin to do things that are more of a contributor to really giving tools to our people that will substantially help their productivity. And I'm encouraged we'll be able to take yet another really good step this next year on being able to hire fewer and continue to hire even higher-quality people each year. And we've hired the finest quality people we've ever hired this year. So, the company is still just an amazing place on the ability to attract great talent, and I think as we give our people more technology tools to use, that's going to improve productivity. Okay. And then just on this long-term outlook, I was just wondering, what type of timeframe are you thinking about reaching these goals? And secondly, with the net charge-offs of 20 to 25 basis points, is that kind of the average through a cycle? Yeah, absolutely. That's through a cycle. So, obviously, year-to-date this year and last year, those were higher, but if you look at some of our previous years, where we had 7 basis points to 8 basis points, they were seemingly low. So that's through a cycle. Peter, when we put these out in January, we were talking about a three-year – it was under our three-year planning horizon. I think what has happened with rates was not what we thought in January. So that's why I said I think it's going to take a little bit longer. And I don't know exactly what that looks like. We're in the midst of our updating our three-year planning cycle, and so we'll try to give a little bit more color on that in January, when we update our – when we do 2020 guidance and kind of update for the three years. And obviously we'll have some better visibility on this rate situation... On rate, exactly. ...and that's what's primarily it's driving the  (00:56:59). Absolutely. Okay. And then just my last question, just you had mentioned on CECL, there shouldn't be much of a change given the commercial short-term nature of the portfolio. I'm just wondering, does that include, I guess, a fairly positive economic outlook as well? Yeah. One of the things I've said is that I think that while I think commercially focused things are not going to have dramatically different reserve levels, I think that the introduction of forecasting into that is going to drive more volatility. So, I don't know that it's going to be overall higher level, but certainly that it could drive more volatility on a quarter-to-quarter and a year-to-year basis. But right now, you guys still have a fairly positive economic outlook? We do. (00:57:56). Yes. Texas is doing quite well. And there are lots of mixed signals, but overall, we're positive on the economy. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. You're welcome. Our next question is from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Thank you. Keith, do these results include – sorry, back to credit for just a second – do the results you reported include a redetermination period for the  EMP (00:58:30) loans? That is underway, and so it is something that takes 60 days or so, Jennifer. So, some of that has been incorporated, but it's not been completed. We don't anticipate any significant change, but that is not put to bed. Okay. Okay. And you're still contracting your leveraged loan book through the end of this year. What does leveraged lending look like for TCBI going forward? What will you be doing differently than previously? Well, we really, before we started this process, talked and had many meetings to talk about that business we want for the long run. And the business we want in this space for the long-term are what we call our trophy sponsor clients, and of course, high-quality, single-run enterprises that happen to also fall into that leveraged lending bucket. So, we're not inclined to take on new sponsors at the pace we did over the last five years. We like the sponsors that we've had a history of 10 or 15 deals with over the years, understand how they behave when portfolio companies don't go exactly as due diligence and plans suggest. And so, we do like the business. We just believe we were too successful and brought in and took too much market share with some sponsors that we just didn't have the history with. And some of the hiccups we had on deals were with these newer sponsors we've not had the history with. So that is the approach we're taking; we certainly want to take great care of our longtime quality clients here in the PE space and have a great track record, think like operators, not just financial engineers, and we have a wonderful core client base. Over the course of the next year or so, we likely will still tip it down some. It won't be at the same pace. We're not  shooting (01:00:49) for a 30%-type runoff in 2020, it might be something closer to 10%, but just fine-tuning it, we are not ready to give all that detail until January, but that's directionally where we're headed at this point. Last question, Keith. Did the Escrow team have any impact on third quarter results? I'm sorry, Jennifer. I was reading a note someone gave me. The Escrow team. The Escrow team, will they have any... (01:01:20). Do they have... Do they have any major impact? No. ...impacts on third quarter results? No, they haven't. And they won't have their special black box that they've been working with our IT team on for the larger, more complex clients that we'll be bringing on board until the first quarter. So, they have several clients that we can take on and handle very capably, but those that are in more complex businesses, where we need to have the best piece of technology, much like we understood 13 years ago, we needed to build in mortgage finance, mortgage warehouse, we're doing the same type of thing, but we're really listening to their clients and building something that will be a great tool for us and the client, in those cases where we have larger, more complex clients in Escrow. So, they'll have some impact in the fourth quarter, but it should be significantly accelerating as we get into next year. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Please go ahead. Oh, thanks. I was just wondering if you could kind of clarify the math on the energy credit flows. So energy NPAs, $61 million Q2; energy net charge-offs, $16.5 million Q3. I would think that would get to therefore NPAs, say, $46 million, where your NPAs at the end of Q3 were $63 million. And does that imply a new energy NPA of $17 million or $18 million, or no? That's exactly what it was, Brock. Yeah. We mentioned that earlier on the call that the uptick... Yeah, okay. ...in total non-accruals was one energy deal. Okay, got it. All right. And has that been reserved, or is that a new credit? Any time it goes to – any time a loan goes to non-accrual, there's no impairment analysis done, and the appropriate reserve would have been put on it. Okay. All right. Got it. Understand the math now. Thank you. You're welcome. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to President and CEO, Keith Cargill, for closing remarks. I'd like to thank all the call participants for tuning in, and we appreciate your interest and your support. Have a good evening. Thank you for your participation in TCBI's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Please direct requests for follow-up questions to Heather Worley at heather.worley@texascapitalbank.com.

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hancock Whitney Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.  As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Trisha Carlson, Investor Relations Manager. You may begin. Thank you, and good morning. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. We would like to remind everyone to review the Safe Harbor language that was published with yesterday's release and presentation and in the company's most recent 10-K including the risks and uncertainties identified therein. Hancock Whitney's ability to accurately project results or predict the effects of future plans or strategies or predict market or economic developments is inherently limited. We believe that the expectations reflected or implied by any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in our forward-looking statements. Hancock Whitney undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. In addition, some of the remarks this morning contain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial tables. The presentation slides included in our 8-K are also posted with the conference call webcast link on the Investor Relations website. We will reference some of these slides in today's call. Participating in today's call are John Hairston, President and CEO; Mike Achary, CFO; and Chris Ziluca, Chief Credit Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hairston. Thanks, Trisha, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter earnings were solid despite noise from the late quarter closing and simultaneous integration of MidSouth. We also noted positive operating leverage; reduced NPLs, specifically TDRs; outperformed in fee income; controlled expenses, all leading to a top line driven beat to Street consensus. EPS for the quarter was $0.77. This included almost $29 million, or $0.26 per share, of merger-related expenses. Operating leverage was better by almost $6 million, with revenue up $7 million linked quarter, and operating expense up only $1.2 million. Again there were only 10 days of MidSouth included in our results, so no significant operating earnings impact in third quarter. While our NIM narrowed 4 basis points in the quarter, a recovery from a support services energy credit and a proactive stance from reducing deposit cost, helped offset a Fed cut in rates. Credit results were a bit mixed with higher charge-offs related to a one-off RBL bankruptcy and criticized loans were up due to the addition of MidSouth and the recent SNC exam. MidSouth added $82 million of energy loans, mostly support services, to our portfolio. While this added to our overall energy exposure, our organic reductions in energy exposure resulted with total energy remaining below 5% of total loans. We expect to see continued reductions in our energy exposure through the next several quarters. As previously announced, our acquisition of MidSouth Bancorp closed September 20, effective September 21. During that same weekend, we also converted MidSouth clients to our technology systems, closed and/or consolidated 20 branches, and welcomed MSL employees as new Hancock Whitney Associates. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the teams on both sides of the transaction for an on-time, under-budget integration with exceptional quality and attention to client experience. Our capital remains strong with TCE up 7 basis points from June 30, ending the quarter at 8.82%. TCE declined 15 basis points from the MidSouth acquisition due to a higher level of goodwill booked with the transaction. However, net retained earnings were strong enough to help offset that and still build capital. We believe this acquisition is a good example of our overall M&A strategy: infill markets with a high level of cost saves and immediately accretive to EPS. It also gives us opportunities for growth in new markets in North Louisiana and the Dallas metropolitan area. With a solid stream of earnings and strong capital, late in the quarter, our board authorized an increased buyback authorization of 5.5 million shares. This authorization is good through 2020 and we expect to apply it to repurchase stock when the timing is appropriate. As a reminder, we issued just over 5 million shares to former MidSouth shareholders and we welcome those new shareholders to Hancock Whitney. With regards to CSOs, we do acknowledge the operating environment, especially the interest rate environment, has significantly changed since January. Our goals do not include today's rate environment, which is negative, but they also did not include any M&A or stock repurchase activity. MidSouth is a positive to operating leverage and will partially offset the impact of lower rates. During the fourth quarter, we will finalize our updated business plan and we'll reset any of these metrics as appropriate during the process. As we do every January, we will announce new CSOs and discuss positive and negative variances during our January call. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for a few additional comments and details. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the third quarter, excluding the merger-related expenses associated with the MidSouth acquisition, were $1.03 up $0.02 from last quarter. I'll start off by first running through an update around what we acquired with MSL. The acquired loan book totaled $785 million, net of a $41 million or 5% loan mark. As a result of an extensive cleanup process by MSL, only $48 million of the acquired portfolio came over as criticized. What we acquired fits nicely with our strategy of a more granular and better yielding loan book. To that end, the yield on the acquired portfolio was a healthy 5.57%. Slide 8 in our earnings deck shows the impact on our loan portfolio of the acquired book as well as this quarter's organic loan production. MSL's deposit portfolio fits nicely as well. The $1.3 billion of low cost core deposits were acquired with a 38-basis point cost, which of course is beneficial to our overall NIM. We put that money to work right away and paid down some higher cost borrowings late in the quarter. Changing topics and moving to our operational results, a bright spot we think for the quarter was our NIM management. So, our reported NIM did compress 4 basis points from last quarter about what we had guided but with lots of moving pieces and parts. Slide 14 details the major items driving the change. As we report for several quarters now, but once again interest recoveries were part of our results. In the third quarter, interest recoveries drove a 5 basis point positive change in the NIM. As a reminder, last quarter we reported 3 basis points of recoveries. As we increase the bond purchases this quarter in anticipation of the MSL acquisition, our mix of earning assets suffered a bit as we increased the size of the bond portfolio. That dynamic impacted the NIM by about 4 basis points. The size of the bond portfolio will come down to our targeted level of about $6.2 billion early in the fourth quarter. The lower rate environment drove our NIM to the higher end of our 2 basis point to 4 basis point guidance with rate cuts in July and September impacting the quarter's NIM. Also lower mortgage rates led to a higher level of premium amortization up almost a $1 million and compressing the NIM by 1 basis point. Finally, a favorable change in our mix of borrowings helped the balance sheet as we paid down some higher cost funding, leading to a 3 basis point impact to the margin. Looking forward, we will continue to be proactive with our efforts to as much as possible offset the impact of future rate cuts by reducing deposit costs. As you can see from the chart on the bottom left of slide 14 we were proactive in lowering deposit costs during the quarter and we'll continue to do so. Our guidance for the fourth quarter NIM is for additional narrowing of 2 basis points to 4 basis points. Fee income was a bright spot for the quarter, specialty fee income continued its positive trend within non-interest income with quarter-over-quarter increases in syndication fees and derivative income. The quarter also reflects increases in most of the business lines and with only 10 days of MSL in the quarter the impact from that transaction was minimal. As a result of the continued strong performance of most business lines, we increased our overall guidance for year-over-year growth and non-interest income to around 10%. Operating expense was another bright spot for the quarter with a reported increase of only $1.2 million. The main driver of this increase was the higher level of annual valuation adjustments on foreclosed assets partly offset by gains on sales of properties. As we factor in MSL for the full fourth quarter, we increased our year-over-year guidance for expense growth slightly to 7% to 8%. We expect to harvest the remaining cost saves by year-end and will have MSL fully integrated by January 1, of 2020. As we noted in our guidance when fully reflected next quarter, we would expect that the MSL-related merger cost to come in about $4 million to $6 million lower than initially projected. One final item before I turn the call back to John for Q&A. Slide 13 details our current expectations around the impact of CECL. Please note that the guidance of a 20% to 30% increase in the allowance for credit losses does not yet include MSL. I will now turn the call back over to John. Thanks Mike. Catherine, let's just go straight to questions. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is open. Hey. Good morning, everyone. How are you? Good morning, Michael. Hey. Maybe we can just start on the margin, Mike, appreciate the 2 basis points to 4 basis points guidance. What does that assume in terms of potential rate cuts? Looks like there's a pretty high probability we get one in October, as well as thoughts around the ability to further reduce deposit costs and if you can remind us how much of the book roughly is exception price? Thanks. Sure. I'd be glad to be, Michael. So as we think about the fourth quarter, we certainly have a couple of headwinds to kind of overcome. We kind of called out in the numbers that we had had 5 basis points of interest recovery this past quarter. Certainly, we can continue to have some level of interest recoveries, but certainly not expecting that level or magnitude. The other items, of course, would be the full quarter impact of the September rate cut. And we are assuming a late October rate cut as well. So those two cuts, the full impact of September, partial impact of October is kind of built into our guidance. Now on the positive side, of course, we'll have a full quarter's impact of MSL. We're kind of calling out the impact of MSL on our NIM at around 4 basis points as opposed to the 3 basis points we had kind of talked about  at (12:38) announcement. And then finally in the fourth quarter, we usually have a pretty nice inflow of DDA deposits, plus we did pay down some of our borrowings, specifically brokered CDs, in the third quarter. So that will kind of round out the guidance to the narrowing of 2 to 4 basis points. You also asked about deposit costs. We have been proactive in reducing our deposit costs this past quarter. I think there is a slide and a chart in the materials that really kind of called that out. And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we'll continue to be proactive in reducing our deposit cost. So that's something that we did last quarter and we'll continue to do so going forward. Mike, that's a great color. Yeah, maybe just as a follow-up because we've heard on a couple of calls this morning, can you just describe, just overall, the outlook for the energy portfolio? Yeah, I know there was a charge off this quarter, you guys appear to have pretty healthy reserves, but can you just give us a high level outlook for energy migration from here? Thanks. We do. We actually built those reserves a little bit this quarter, but I'll turn it over to Chris Ziluca to give some color around the energy book. Yeah. So during the quarter, obviously, we had the one-off charge in the RBL and we did have a little additional migration in the criticized loan levels. We don't really see substantial increased migration in that portfolio. Matter of fact, there is some opportunity for some upside. But as the cycle kind of continues to wind forward, we continue to watch for some credits in the portfolio and where they might head. But I don't really see anything dramatic in the near future related to our energy portion of our portfolio. So the issues that you're seeing are they largely unrecovered credits from years ago on the service side, or are these really new issues kind of popping up at this point, or is it just kind of legacy issues that are just resolving themselves now? Yeah. So, most of them are more legacy-related credits. None of the newer credits that we booked in the past year or two are really presenting issues for us. So we're just continuing to kind of work through some unique issues with those individual credits. Michael, this is John. Just to give you a little more color that may be helpful. The migration that Chris mentioned earlier was actually in the RBL side, not the services side. I think we actually saw improvement in the services book through the quarter without the migration – and  I'm removing MSL from from restricted comment, (15:34) we would have actually had a fairly healthy reduction in criticized, net of the RBL migration, that was really more centered in the SNC exam. And to be specific about the credits, these were not new credit issues, these were more organizations that had been grappling with issues for some time, and with the lack of liquidity available, specifically areas they had depended on in the past, they went to bankruptcy and ended up actually showing up in the NPLs. This is... Okay. So, the – yeah, it is and the SNC exam helped – drove some of the increase. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Appreciate it. Yeah. And as a reminder, I think we put in the deck, 100% of the SNC exam downgrades were reflected in the numbers, so there's no trailing items from the SNC exam we expect to bear in Q4. Got it. Thanks again. You bet. Thank you, and our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Hey, Brad. Mike, maybe I wanted to start with expenses, really good cost control this quarter. Obviously fee income continues to do really well for you guys, which typically also means some higher expense quarters but it didn't play out that way this quarter. Just kind of curious, kind of the puts and takes on the expense side and kind of how you guys are thinking about controlling those costs going forward, particularly with MSL coming into the fold. Sure, absolutely Brad. So, yeah, a good quarter in terms of our ability to control expenses, expenses only up about $1.2 million. We kind of called out the biggest negative for the quarter and that was the $1.7 million increase in our re-expense and I think the materials do a good job of kind of calling out and explaining what that difference was, but I think the other things certainly that we're doing is we're doing a good job of creating opportunities to reduce costs so that we continue to invest in the company. Last quarter we talked about some of the digital and other related investments that we're making. We're continuing to make those investments. They don't show up this quarter in the list of variances because again I think we were able to create some room for those investments and expenses, but those items will continue going forward. Now certainly in the fourth quarter, one item I'll call out is, we'll have some what we call temporary expenses related to MSL as we kind of complete our process of harvesting the cost saves. So again, reaffirming the previous guidance that we've given around the 50% to 55% cost saves and having that fully reflected and in place by year-end so that we can walk into 2020 with an efficient operation related to that transaction. And maybe bigger picture do you think with the NIM compression that you expect you'll be able to continue to generate positive operating leverage as you move out over the next several quarters or is the revenue environment such that it'll make it more challenging? Well certainly it's a challenging with the right environment and we kind of talked about our NIM guidance for the fourth quarter. We have again a full quarter's impact with the September rate cut and then we're assuming the Fed does move in October. As of right now we have no additional rate cuts projected for the rest of the year so certainly if that happens in that manner, that will be helpful to revenue. We also as a reminder, typically have one of the better quarters for loan growth in the fourth quarter from a seasonal point of view. So when we put all that together certainly we're looking to continue to generate positive operating leverage into the fourth quarter and kind of beyond. Certainly, the operating leverage that we generate in the third quarter was significant. I don't know that we'll be at that same level in the fourth quarter but certainly positive going for. Yeah. Okay. Great. And then one last follow-up, does your NIM guidance, does that include impact from any additional accretion for MidSouth or any recoveries there would that be above and beyond kind of that 2 basis points to 4 basis points of compression? No. We have some level of accretion kind of built into the fourth quarter numbers. At this point, no specific recoveries though for the fourth quarter. Great. All right. Thank you, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Morning, Matt. I wanted to start on the fees, obviously good quarter on fee income. And I think MidSouth will bring over a few million dollars of fee income in the fourth quarter, it just looked like the 10% full-year guidance on fee income growth could be a little conservative. Can you just walk us through some of the various lines and help us appreciate what we should be looking forward in the fourth quarter and are there any lines in there that you think could be sequentially lower in the fourth quarter? Matt, this is John. I'll start and then Mike can add some commentary if he'd like to. The fourth quarter – we'll just first talk about those things that have the potential to diminish, and it's purely seasonal. Once you get past the middle of November through about the end of January, typically, mortgage transactional business tails off a bit, as do, even in this environment, the swaps. It's not because any appetite changes just things get a little busy that particular time of the year. All other business lines would be expected to perform well and certainly with the rate drop in September and if the one in October late does indeed happen, our team expresses some potential thought that mortgage and swap derivative income may actually outperform that normal seasonal reduction. So it's pretty hard to predict because we don't know what the rate cut may or may not be in October. But generally speaking from a seasonal perspective fourth quarter dips a little from Q4, tied primarily to mortgage and refi specifically. If the rate cut stimulates production then that diminishment may not occur. And... So the 10%'s basically trying to split the gap there and come up with something we think is a reasonable expectation. That's helpful and then what about the impact from MidSouth. I know that  portfolio (22:42) has been shrinking and you've been closing some branches, could the fee income run rate there also slow compared to what we've seen over last few quarters for MidSouth? There's a couple of moving parts and it's a good question. It's worth noting the Hancock Whitney's fee income penetration of revenue is right at 27%, where MidSouth's, at least for the second quarter which was the only closed quarter we've got to refer to, was 23%. So there's a fair number of products that have not yet been offered at least not from the core bank to the MidSouth clientele. That's not going to all materialize immediately because there's always some distraction as the team members get comfortable and reach a cadence in offering that type of product line. So there is a good fee income potential to come forward. Note that MidSouth really didn't have a mortgage business to speak of. So there really is no downside Q4 to Q3 in that book for fee income related to mortgage because there weren't any in the third quarter to cause it to diminish if that makes sense. And the derivatives and swaps were certainly not part of that book either. So the reasons for a pullback in Q4 for Hancock Whitney would not apply to the MSL book. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. I appreciate the details that you gave us on slide 8 that talks about the remix of the loan portfolio. And it looks like the last few quarters had a pretty high correlation with the prime rate. I'm showing that new loan yields prime minus 25 bps on average or somewhere close to that. Is that the right way to think about the new loan yields as we move forward in the next few quarters in a lower interest rate environment,  5% minus 25 bps (24:32)? Boy, that's a tough one. I think it's fair to say we are still even in Q4 – excuse me, Q3 and even in late Q3, even with the rate reduction in September, we're still booking business at a positive gap to portfolio, get two or three more rate decreases that certainly becomes more challenging. And so we still believe that the new loan yields have an opportunity, together with the remix, to help with overall yield, but every two or three month rate increases certainly are a challenge to that. And Matt, this is Mike, I think I would add to that. The fact that the correlation with prime rate for the kind of loans we're making around our remix focus I think is pretty coincidental. I don't know that that's a real cause and effect. LIBOR is a bigger driver than prime for us. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. You bet. Thanks for the question. Thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Catherine. I wanted to ask a question on gross. It feels like we were expecting kind of mid-single digit growth rate excluding MidSouth going into the back half of the year and now we've got mid-single digit even with MidSouth. And so, can you just kind of talk about some of the growth dynamics in your portfolio where you're seeing some of the slowdown, where you see maybe more opportunity going into the fourth quarter? And then, if you can provide it, kind of a growth rate that you would assume to be appropriate for us to think about for next year? Catherine, I'll go ahead and start and then handed over to John to color. But specifically, for the fourth quarter, when we think about growth in terms of the guidance that we've given of mid-single digits average growth year-over-year, what we're looking at specifically is probably something between 4.5% and 5.5%. So right at about 5% or so and that should translate into fourth quarter end of period growth of about $275 million to $325 million. So, as you know, as mentioned earlier the fourth quarter tends to be our better growth order from a seasonal point of view. So certainly there could be some potential to outperform that growth a bit specifically related to MSL, we really have assumed no additional growth in the fourth quarter just yet related to that book, so if we're able to – to grow the acquired book then certainly that's some upside to those numbers as well. So hopefully that makes sense. Okay. So on a dollar basis, you're saying fourth quarter end of period growth should be between $275 million and $325 million. That's correct, yes. That's right, okay, that's a big jump from then what we see in the past couple of quarters? Well, it would be and this is John and in addition to the color, I think Mike did a good job giving that color, the only thing I would add is the pipeline for end of 3Q is, I'm going to call it 27% better than end of quarter June. So the pipeline improvement coupled with some possibility that's not factored in the number Mike gave about MSL recovering some business that may have dwindled a tad in the past couple of years, with the seasonal land utilization increases we always get in Q4 are all tailwinds to growth and just as a reminder, remember there were – we were – weren't kidding around having a 5% loan concentration and energy of being a high watermark and bringing that total down. So the reduction of about $60 million in the organic Hancock Whitney book for energy was a deliberate action that we took in 3Q to make room if you will for the additional volume coming in from the MidSouth acquisition. And so that was a cause for growth too. So the storyline for 3Q while growth was not impressive, spreads remain good, and the mix change was good. And it also allowed us to reduce the energy number down below what we have as our tolerance. So there were a few moving pieces there but it wasn't a lack of production. It was more the mix changes we're making in the balance sheet that we believe are good for value in the long run. Okay. Yeah that's really helpful. And then maybe one other question on buybacks, you announced a buyback now that MidSouth has closed. Can you talk a little bit about how aggressive you feel like you'll be on that buyback, is it more of – to manage the capital levels or how price sensitive you are with that? Catherine, this is Mike. So, obviously we disclosed that the board increased that authority to the $5.5 million. And what I'll say about that is, certainly we intend to exercise that authority. And I think you'll see us do that over the coming months. Great. All right. Thank you. You're Welcome. Thank you. Thank you.  I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. John Hairston for any closing remarks. Thank you, Catherine. And thanks to everyone for your interest in Hancock Whitney organization. I know you're busy, and we appreciate you dialing in this call. Have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference is – ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day and welcome to the Preferred Bank Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tony Rossi of Financial Profiles, please go ahead. Thank you, operator.

Preferred Bank assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Li Yu. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Li Yu. I'm pleased to report our third quarter net income of $20 million, or $1.32 a share. Although this is only slightly better than the second quarter, but we have had two Fed rate cuts in the quarter. We have a very strong quarter in loan production. Although the final results of loan only increased $89 million or roughly 10% annualized to-date, but this was tarnished by the last quarter's activities. If you recall that at June 30 earnings con call, I reported to you that there had been a large usage right at the quarter end, a customer of the C&I credit line, which was paid off immediately in early July. That has benefited the production results of the second quarter, but hurt the third quarter. As a matter of fact, we had one of the largest long production quarters in our corporate history. During the quarter, we have originated $511 million in new commitments, which had outstanding balance of $349 million of new loans for this quarter. But to us, the real highlights is our deposits production. Our deposits increased $192 million or 20% on an annual basis. We have had a number of quarters that our deposits were trailing the gross rate of the loan. We're so pleased to see this increase in deposits that added additional liquidity to fund our future growth. At quarter end, we had $465 million cash on hand. Although  this large (00:04:51) increase in deposit had changed somewhat the leverage, which affected the net interest margin, which reduced 23 basis points from last quarter. The decrease was largely related to the Fed rate cuts. We have had some interest cost reduction. Our transactional accounts interest cost has reduced reasonably, but our TCD deposit interest did not reduce by much. This is largely because of the maturity schedule and market competition. We will continue to focus on our deposit costs. Loan quality  (00:06:02) is stable. We had a $435 million loan charge-off – charge-off in the quarter, but that was related to orders previously fully reserved nonaccrual loans. Year-to-date, we had a $216,000 of net recovery. We have today – on September 30, we bought back 209,000 shares of our own common stock and the buyback activity is ongoing. The bank has always been trying to maintain a low operating expense and a high profitability. And we'll certainly continue to do so. Thank you. And I'm ready for your questions. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Aaron Deer of Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hi. Hi, Aaron. Good morning. I was impressed by the deposit inflows this quarter, and I was hoping to understand maybe the dynamics behind that a little better. Can you talk about where those were coming from, and if it was through the branches or through some of your deposit gathering teams specifically, and what kind of costs those new deposits came on at. I'm curious to know if you were lagging others in the market who are dropping the costs and so that helped to bring some more inflows your way or what were the dynamics there? We were getting our deposits in several different sources with the big increases. And obviously, number one is the – we're gaining certain customers. As I reported earlier, we had originated $511 million of new loans. Many new loan customers with – over a very meaningful deposit rate. Second is that actually relate to our customers. Last quarter and heavy usage of their own fund, as I also reported last quarter end, this has reversed a normal situation. So their bank account has increased with us. Other than that, our gathering team all over the bank is having their normal growth. So these three factors adding to a increase in our deposits. So have you tested the market in terms of – where do your deposit costs stand today versus three months ago and do you expect to be able to continue reducing deposit costs if you're moving them in that direction, and how do you expect your deposit flows to react? Yeah.  (00:09:35) but we have  on the general deposit reduction basis to lead is that the transactional accounts will be priced  (00:09:48) and certainly market competition will affect that. The TCD will continue pricing the lower in our costs. But it depends on maturity schedule. Not all TCD can change costs overnight. At average, they reduce one-fourth each month. Ed, do you want to add to it? Sure. Yeah. In terms of looking at month-over-month and this is nothing that's public. But since we're are on a public speaker, the average cost of deposits has come down 14 basis points in just the last two months alone. So we are starting to see some traction. We just did not see a lot of traction from a quarter-over-quarter basis, when you look at the average cost. As we look at the CD maturity schedule out six months, there's going to be a pretty decent differential between what's maturing and what's coming on and renewing. And that's only going to get more noticeable as we get toward the end of the year and the beginning part of 2020. The differentials are going to be very large if we remain in this current interest rate environment. So Ed, if we see – let's presume that we get no additional rate cuts just for simplicity sake, but the rate environment and the curve stays as it is today, obviously, with those initial rate cuts it hit the margin pretty hard. With the secondary effect of deposit costs now coming down as a result, with that setup, where would you expect the margin to trend from here? That's the $64,000 question, Aaron. Given the fact that rates are going to –  if we're assuming rates are going to stay the same, I would expect to see a little more compression in the current margin and then I would expect to see margin expansion. We currently have nearly half the floating rate book protected in terms of two further rate cuts. So the floors are certainly kicking in and we'll start to make a difference if we get any more. Okay. That actually goes to my next question. It was in the nature of the floors. Can you talk about where those floors were layered in as rates were going up and what that means for your loan yields and as we come back down again? Well, as they were going up, obviously, they weren't as much of a concern, although we kept them in place as rates were going up. But as you can imagine, the difference between what we're actually getting yields versus the floors in an up rate environment is fairly meaningless because it's so wide. Those things start to narrow as rates start to come down. And what our goal has been has to try to – as each loan renews is to try to pick up the floor a little bit on these prime-based loans, if we can if we have the leverage to. Right now, we have roughly over $900 million of floating rate prime-based loans that are already at their floors. And that's exactly what I was looking for. Can you break out of the $3.5 billion of loans, how much of that is protected by floors and at what rates below where the prevailing rate is today. Before Ed replies to you on that okay, actually, mathematically, one thing. There is few other dynamics in the real life that we have to account for it, for our bank, I think, as for many other bank. We will be continuously new loan being made and old loan being paid off. Old loan usually carry a floor is much lower. So the so-called layer will change on a monthly basis. Second thing, many new old loans gets renewed. And when they're renewed, they're generally updated to a higher level floor, if not the current floor. All these factors is depending on also the movement of the proportion also as how much being paid off, how much is the new loans, that's being originated, right. So these are changing. We have seen a very encouraging curve of moving up the floors, okay, to the situation. So even I with obvious information  (00:14:42)  I cannot estimate what the result is. And I appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess, just to add to that as I said, we have about roughly $940 million of floating rate prime-based loans that are at their floor. They will not move. In addition to that in the portfolio, we have over $500 million of fixed rate loans, which will not move obviously. So we're protected on those components of loans. And then as Mr. Yu says, this number in terms of our fully indexed rates that are at their floor, below their floor, is really a dynamic number. And to give you an example, the dollar amount of loans that were at/or below floor doubled from August to September. So some of that is a result of the rate cut, but also a lot of that is a result of what our officers are doing in terms of these loan renewals. Sure. Okay. Well, good. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the loan floor question. If we get another rate cut here, whether it's October or December, how many additional loans will be at the floor with one more rate cut all else equal? Let's see. You want a rough estimate? Well, I will say probably 20% of the loans, okay, will be upgraded to the floor. Yeah. To the projected level. Yeah. (00:16:26) Okay, that's helpful. That was between the dynamics I was talking about. And then, the current rate that is only 25 basis points below the floor, not below the – whatever, below this index, okay. Yeah, index. Okay. That's helpful. And then, also want to dive in maybe a little bit further on the spread between the roll-off for new CD money dynamic. Ed, what is the spread now between the CD rate you're putting on today versus what's maturing? Today, Steve, it is around 30 basis points. Okay. However, as I said – as I was telling Aaron, as we get closer to the end of this year and into the beginning of next year that spread widened significantly upwards of 60 basis points plus. And that's before any additional rate cuts? Yes, sir. And that's before any additional rate cuts. If we get more rate cuts, that's obviously going to get bigger. Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just wondering on the loan pipeline, obviously, you mentioned it was a good quarter for originations. How was customer activity and what's the outlook on that front? Well, the third quarter is historically one of our better quarters in the situation. And fourth quarter is historically one of the unpredictable quarters by history. We have seen that with the rate reduction, many higher that become little more active on the marketplace – on the real estate and many more active – many more new projects wanted to be started. So I would say, the general environment on loan production is trending towards a little bit in terms of real estate activity CRE is concerned. On the  CMA (00:18:44) side, we see a little bit more usage of our credit line mainly because of the cost reduction. But the real thing is that –  why don't you go ahead and (00:18:56) give you more color in the whole situation there. Well, I think that the real color is that, Steve, as Mr. Yu mentioned that it looks like the pipeline is exactly we –  it's hard to predict. I think the bogey is the payoff because the payoff is always lingering out there. So while our loan pipeline – it looks pretty robust right now. We do have some loans that carried over upon third quarter as well. So as I mentioned again, the payoff is the bogey. Okay. That's helpful. And then, one last question for me, just obviously a more challenging rate environment, but the floors going forward definitely help. How do we think about expenses going forward? I know you guys want to maintain a low efficiency ratio. But is there a possibility that expenses could come down? There was obviously a very good cost control this quarter. Well, so one thing is that – so it's going to be – we all want to control our deposits. But we have been controlling our costs to the level is probably one of the lowest in the industry. So going forward, I think the cost as a percentage-wise speaking will maintain the current level because of our total assets will be growing. Our loan portfolio and deposits will be growing. But the pure expenses it always increases. I'm not going to go tell my staff you guys are going to take a cut next year, okay? So in fact, with the labor market as it is right now... It's going to be a suicide. ...recruiting people is – I've never had such a difficult period in recruiting new staff. Well, it's actually –  human cost us two-thirds of – nearly close – a little bit over two-thirds of the total cost structure. So that's the biggest element. And rent  (00:21:14) increase, right? And all other cost seems to be all picks up a little bit. We don't see any decrease in the same, okay? Lawyers always charge you more by the day, okay? So our hope is that – our practice has been that to growing our bank to keep our costs in control. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Tanner of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering, Ed, if you could tell us what the average loan yields were in the quarter versus the second quarter? Average loan yield for third quarter, Gary, was 5.93 versus an average of 6.14 for Q2. Thank you. And just to clarify, in Li Yu's prepared remarks, the production and new loans, were those year-to-date numbers? No, those were for the quarter. It was a very robust quarter for loan production, over $500 million. Okay. Would you run us through what those numbers again just really quick? Well, we had a net loan origination of... 5.11, yeah. (00:22:42) that's a commitment. The outstanding amount of new loan that was originated in the third quarter is $349 million. So the differential would be the payoffs. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. (00:23:05). Our next question comes from Tim Coffey of Janney. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hi. Hey. Good morning. Hey. Ed, if we looked at the regulator for Preferred as of the second quarter, it indicated that 70% of CD book would mature by the middle of next year. A quarter since that data, has things have – has that percentage materially changed? I wouldn't say so. No. That sounds about right. 70% in nine months, is that the timeframe you're talking about, Tim? Yes. Okay. Now that sounds about right. Okay. And where are you on the buyback authorization? How much more do you have the ability to buyback? We have spent as of September 30 is roughly one-third of our money. So we are intending that it continues. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Those of my questions have been answered. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Stafford of Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just one more follow-up from me. I apologize if you've touched on this already. I was just curious what – if you can speak to, what initial tariff impacts you've seen across the portfolio if at all yet, and if you guys complete any kind of review on potential impacts? Thanks. We had a tariff impact in general that only affects a very small portion of our total portfolio, okay? And we haven't seen anything affecting us at this point in time. We have completed review in two different times during the year on the tariff effect. We have a account-by-account analysis, okay, in terms of the tariff situation. And in fact, roughly maybe 40, 50 of investors during the conferences have been discussing in detail with Ed, every one of these accounts and how they happen. We have spent a substantial management time in doing so. Hello? Our next question comes from Aaron Deer of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up. Ed, on the $400,000 FDIC assessments credit, I'm guessing there's probably a similar amount that you'll benefit from in the fourth quarter and then maybe some more in the first quarter. Am I thinking about that right? Or is it going to extend for a longer period? You might be thinking about that correct. Yes, Aaron. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Not as a same amount, though. Right. Our next question comes from Don Worthington of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thank you. Just had one question in terms of credit, credit is still pretty benign, but just curious as to what you might be thinking in terms of provisioning going forward? Well, there's two things. On the next quarter, we'll be providing breakdown on current methodology bit. But in January, we will be providing –  in the first quarter, we will be providing based on the new CECL, okay? The early indication is that the increase is not big, okay? But we're happy with that. The hit to our capital is going to be very, very little. But when we're providing nowadays, I have to make this very clear. People think that we have certain liberty in providing our loan loss reserve. Actually, the loan loss is based on rigid formula, okay? That was really by our accountants, okay, that going through the historical factor and the so-called historical loss estimate, all those models they have built up. So right now, every quarter, we're doing it based on whatever is needed. Having said that, we have 40 and well reserved at this point in time, which is indicated in our reporting over the place, including all the external people's reports, okay? But going forward, the provision will be based on new loan production. Unless there's new weaknesses, okay? Or if there's some really changes in upgrading that will be affecting that our loan loss provision on the positive side. So having said that, I don't know whether you want more color from Nick or not, okay? I I'd be happy to take it if he has some. Nick? Just like  (00:28:34) mentioned earlier that we have conducted a very detailed loan review with each team – lending unit to go through with their CRE, C&I loan portfolios. And at this moment, we still consider that our loan portfolio is pretty healthy without any severe concern at this time. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Okay. I guess there's no further question, huh? Okay, thank you very much. Okay. Thank you for your attention today, okay. And although that in a very downward market, okay, but we feel pretty good with our production. We feel pretty good with our profitability and we feel pretty good about our return to our shareholders. Thank you so much. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

After comments by management today, we will open up this call for questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pin Tai. Thank you, Georgia, and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. This afternoon, we reported net income of $72.8 million for the third quarter of 2019, a 4.3% increase when compared to net income of $69.8 million for the third quarter of 2018. Diluted earnings per share increased by 7.1% to $0.91 for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $0.85 per share for the same quarter a year ago. In the third quarter of 2019, our gross loans grew by $171.8 million to $14.8 billion or an increase of 4.9% on an annualized basis. The increase in loans for the third quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the growth in commercial SBA loans of $190 million or 11.3% annualized and residential mortgage loans including loans held for sale of $118.5 million or 12.8% annualized, partially offset by the decrease in commercial loans of $104.9 million and the sales of $38.1 million in residential mortgage loans. We anticipate loan growth in 2019 of between 6% to 7%. For the third quarter of 2019, our total deposits increased $295.3 million or 8.6% annualized to $14.7 billion. The increase in deposits for the third quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the growth in money market deposits of $186.2 million or 36.7% annualized and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $181.6 million or 25.4% annualized, partially offset by the decrease in time deposits of $92.6 million. We continued our stock buyback program and repurchased 135,000 shares of our stock at an average cost of $34.76 a share in the third quarter of 2019. We will purchase additional shares in the fourth quarter of 2019, depending upon stock price, general business and market conditions, and other pertinent factors. With respect to the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, we continue to monitor and evaluate this potential impact to our loan portfolio.  All of that (00:05:11) that we believe could be adversely impacted by the current tariff hold approximately 2.5% of our total loans. With that, I'll turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Heng Chen, to discuss the third quarter of 2019 financials in more detail. Thank you, Pin, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter, we announced net income of $72.8 million or $0.91 in earnings per share. Our net interest margin was 3.56% in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to 3.83% in the third quarter of 2018, and 3.58% for the second quarter of 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 12 basis points to the net interest margin compared to 5 basis points for the third quarter of 2018, and 3 basis points for the second quarter of 2019. We expect our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be between 3.45% and 3.50% based on a 0.25 point rate cut after the October 30 Fed meeting. Non-interest income during the third quarter of 2019 increased by $2.6 million to $10.4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in the valuation of interest rate swap contracts and $0.8 million gain on the sale of residential mortgages. Non-interest expense decreased by $0.4 million or 0.6% to $65.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 when compared to $66 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the third quarter of 2019, the decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $4.1 million decrease in the amortization of investments in low income housing and alternative energy partnerships, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in salary and employee benefits, a $1.2 million increase in marketing expense, and a $0.7 million increase in professional services. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 22.4%. The third quarter effective tax rate reflects the year-to-date adjustment to the full year effective tax rate. The third quarter 2019 income tax expense includes a $1.4 million adjustment to reflect the impact of a delay in installation of solar systems and a $0.8 million adjustment for lower than expected low income housing tax credits. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 20%. Solar tax credit amortization was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2019. We project solar tax credit amortization of approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. At September 30, 2019, our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio decreased to 10.81% as compared to 10.83% at December 31, 2018. Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased to 12.41% from 12.43% at December 31, 2018 and our total risk-based capital ratio decreased to 14.06% from 14.15% at December 31, 2018. Net recoveries for the third quarter of 2019 were $5.3 million compared to net recoveries of $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 and net recoveries of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. There was a loan loss reversal of $2 million for the third quarter of 2019 compared to no loan loss provision in the second quarter of 2019 and a loan loss reversal of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our non-core loans decreased by $7.5 million to $47.2 million or 0.32% of period end loans as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2019. Thank you, Heng. We will now proceed to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Our first question comes from Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Hi, Aaron. Heng, if I back out the interest recovery and prepayment penalties, it looks like the core margin was around 3.44% in the third quarter and your guidance for the fourth quarter is 3.45% to 3.50%, if I heard you correctly. And just given some of the yield pressures that we're seeing across the industry, what gives you confidence that we're going to see kind of a flattish to maybe even up margin here in the fourth quarter? Yeah. You know that guidance it's more art than science, but one thing is we have on our CDs on a point to point basis, they declined by 6 basis points from June 30, 2019, to September 30, 2019. And two, we had a large influx of DDA and money market deposits late in the third quarter and those deposits are still here. So we think we'll get some benefit in the NIM from that in the fourth quarter. And then we typically get about 4 basis points in prepayment penalties and interest recoveries. So I think since the guidance is in round nickel basis, I mean, we can argue about whether it should be 3.43% or whatever, but anyway that's our expectation. Sure. I understand. I guess sticking with the same theme. I think you guys probably toward the tail end of – or maybe you've completed your summer CD campaign. Maybe where are the offered rates now on your one-year CDs relative to what they were a year ago? Yeah. I think we've learned from experience, so we are leaving – we have general guidance to our branch managers, so that we don't wind up overpaying for smaller CDs, but I think the best reflection of that is in the four quarters from now that – which reflects the CDs that will re-price this quarter, the rate has dropped down to 1.78% versus our 9/30 average rate of 2.07%. And then for the upcoming quarter, the average CD rate is 2.06%. So, I think roughly we are picking up maybe about 30 basis points from the re-pricing, and we're hoping that it's – right now, I think our deposits are a little sticky on the re-pricing side, because there's still a few banks that are offering CD promotions and it takes a while for deposits to get used to the now lower rates. But we think as time goes on in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to improve on that. That's right. Thanks for taking my questions. Sure. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray. Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Matthew. Just to clarify your NIM guidance of 3.45% to 3.50% is on a reported basis, including 4 basis points of prepay and recoveries, correct? Yes. Yes. Okay. And then just on the buyback, activity slowed this quarter, I assume that's partly just given your concerns around the trade war. But then again your non-performers and your TDRs were both down. Can you speak to your appetite to buy back stock, and how much is left remaining under the current authorizations? Yeah, I believe there's $20 million that's left, and the Fed recently changed the requirements of bank holding companies. They don't need regulatory approval for new buybacks. And then in terms of the appetite, I think we look at it as a fairly long campaign rather than trying to hit a particular amount every quarter. So, I think as Pin mentioned  (00:16:46), it depends on the circumstance. And for sure, we'll do some amount in Q4. And then 2020 is a new year, and obviously we'll have to do a fair amount given the compression on the NIM. Great. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Lana. Hi. Hi. You slowed the loan growth guidance for the full year to 6% to 7% from 7% to 8% before, I think. Is that because you're planning on selling more resi mortgage? I think the larger issue is that, we almost have a $4 billion residential mortgage portfolio. And for the lower rates, we are seeing more prepayments or refinancings and so that's the main driver for that. And then, we did move $37 million of loans to held for sale and we sold them last week. So – but that's the extent of residential mortgage loan sales for this quarter. Okay. Thank you. And my second question is, can you give us an update on the expected tax credit amortization expense in 4Q as well as the tax rate? Oh, yeah. The amortization is $5 million for solar, probably $5 million for low income housing, and the tax rate for the fourth quarter would be 20%. Okay. Thanks, Heng. Sure. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust. Hey, thanks for the question. Wanted to follow back up on the loan growth question. Just C&I balances were down pretty significantly this quarter. Could you provide a little bit color around what was driving that? Yeah. Go ahead, Pin. Do you want to... We had some pay down and pay off during the third quarter. That probably caused around a decrease of $15 million and we also have a certain amount of loan that we tried to close in the third quarter that got pushed into October that caused the decrease in C&I loan outstanding. And should we... (00:19:35) Yeah, for lack of anything else, go ahead, yeah. I was just going to ask, should we expect kind of a rebound in C&I balances in 4Q with capital call lines and some other things kind of kicking in in the fourth quarter, just was curious what you're seeing in pipelines there? And also if you've seen any change in demand for the 1 to 4 family mortgage products? Yes. We expect some increase in the fund financing lending. And also you know for the syndication department that  (00:20:18) they're expecting kind of a increase in volume later in the month. And residential mortgage, we're still going strong. So add together, I think we should expect to have higher loan growth in the fourth quarter. Okay. One just cleanup question for me, just on other expenses dropped down a good bit this quarter. Any anything that changed there, Heng? Well, other expenses I think the – Michael, you're talking about other other or just... Yeah. Other around $4 million this quarter versus $6 million last quarter? No, I think it's – yeah. I'm trying to think. I think in the second quarter we had higher off-balance sheet – we reserved for off balance sheet commitments. That was about $700,000 and I think that's pretty much it. And I think in the fourth quarter, we're hopeful that we could get a good decrease in that expense as well from the reserve for off balance sheet commitments. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Great. Thanks. If I can just elaborate on the expense question, Heng, if we kind of look into next year, obviously the industry is facing a bit of revenue pressures with margins. How do we think about the pace of investment for the franchise maybe excluding the  taxed (00:22:18) business, what's a reasonable range of expense growth for the franchise? Well, I think we're hopeful that it could be like 2.5%. Now to the extent I was reading some other conference calls scripts, there's people that are pushing off investing until revenues are higher. And I think we'll look at our branch network. We could always find a branch to close and then I think that's part of our planning for 2020, we're going to be very focused on that. And maybe just one more on the tariff. Could you elaborate maybe on some of the conversations you're having with your corporate borrowers, did last  week at all (00:23:26) help and kind of outlook for kind of demand given the tariff situation? Thanks. Yeah. I did speak to many of our customers in different regions and many of them has a plan, they already has a plan, including moving a production facility from China to Vietnam and Cambodia and also diversify their sourcing and also buying from other supplier in different countries to avoid the tariff. So it seems that most customer already has some plans and we're not seeing any performance that could be severely impacted by the tariff so far. Great. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Thanks, good afternoon. Hi. Hi, Gary. Hi. I just had another question actually on that same topic of tariffs and really I was curious about – I know it's still a bit early in the fourth quarter, but where you're seeing drawdowns in trade finance. Are you seeing where you are now being much different from where you would have experienced in years past? In fact when we look at some customers' loan outstanding, they're actually paying down their loans from the sale of their previous inventory, so the loan outstanding so far is not – we have not seen that increase because of the tariff issue. Well, then, you're also not seeing a seasonal increase in drawdowns related to kind of the inventory... No, no, no. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you.  Our next question comes from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Hi, thanks. Couple of questions for you. Starting with a follow-up on the net interest margin. So on a sort of core normalized basis, the guidance kind of implies it to be flattish from third quarter to fourth quarter when you include the normalized level of prepay fee as you said was about 4 basis points. Now, you are seeing a pickup of about 30 basis points on CDs re-pricing. So when we look out to the first quarter of 2020, is there a chance to possibly see the NIM up in the first quarter or is stable sort of the way we should think about it? Well, we have the biggest portion of our CD book re-prices in the first quarter. And this is from our Chinese New Year promotion. So we have $2.6 billion re-pricing in the first quarter, and that portfolio has the highest average rates, it's 2.20 right now. So we're hopeful that when those CDs mature, we can roll on that, let's say 1.60 or 1.70,  all or that (00:27:01) some of them will go back to money market balances. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting gears to the loan growth, you mentioned about the lower guidance is due to refi activity picking up. Now that would kind of imply that your competitors are winning some of that business. Is it that your competitors are being very aggressive on the Street and you're not willing to kind of match that rate? Just could you talk about the competitive dynamics there. Yeah. Let me – well first, we – I'd check with the head of our residential mortgage department and we are primarily a purchase lender. So historically, 80% of our originations have been from purchases. Now in our current pipeline, that has dropped to about 60%. But the bulk of our production is coming from purchases. And then in terms of pricing, the products we offer are kind of unique. There's not – the mainstream banks don't offer this sort of stuff in terms of the low doc mortgage and also to a smaller extent the non-resident alien mortgages. So, there we're pretty competitive for the other Chinese, American peers, but we don't see these depositors refinancing to Wells Fargo or somebody else. But it's a fairly recent development. So, as the months go on, we'll get a better idea as to the extent of the refinancings. Got it. Thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And our final question will come from  K.H. Lii (00:29:22) with Taiwan Holdings. Good afternoon. This is  K.H. (00:29:26) from Taiwan Financial Holdings institutional investor. Are you aware that in the recent Taipei Times news there are some articles on your M&A deals of Far East National Bank, SinoPac Holdings alleged its problems with the deal, strongly suggesting that Cathay and former Bank SinoPac's President, Michael Chang had engaged in illegitimate arrangements in order to get a deal at a unfair price. My question is, has Cathay ever provided benefits for Michael Chang in private in return for an underpriced purchase of FENB and that expecting Preferred Bank Chairman Yu's visit in Taipei and will there be any legal actions against SinoPac in the future in order to protect Cathay's reputation? This is Lisa Kim, I'm the General Counsel of Cathay General Bancorp. We are aware of the issues that are going on in Taiwan, but we are at no provision to say anything and we will not be making any comment on it. Okay. Thank you. At this time, there are no questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Cathay General Bancorp's management for any closing remarks. Thank you for joining us for this call and we look forward to speaking with you at our next quarterly earnings release date. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day."

         "Good morning. My name is Tina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Please go ahead. Hello. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 16, 2019 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak. Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning, PNC reported third quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.94 per diluted common share. Overall, I think we had a really good quarter. We generated solid growth in loans and deposits. We grew total revenue by 1% as both NII and noninterest income increased. You saw we managed expenses well even as we continued to invest in our businesses and infrastructure and we improved our efficiency ratio. Overall credit quality also remained strong and we increased the capital we returned to shareholders in the third quarter through share repurchases and the dividend. We continue to execute on our strategies to extend the reach of our middle market corporate banking franchise into new markets and to expand our Retail Banking brand nationally. We delivered these results despite uncertainty in the market related to everything from slowing economic growth, trade restrictions, geopolitical concerns and the interest rate environment. As we look toward the remainder of the year and ahead to 2020, there are obvious unanswered questions about the environment we are operating in along with the intensity of entering a presidential election year. However, we will not be distracted by things that are beyond our control. Rather you'll see us continue to invest and work to improve the customer experience to reach more customers with our products and services and to offer superior solutions to our customers' evolving banking and investment needs. Last week, you would have seen the Federal Reserve voted on the final rules for the tailoring proposals. The rules are essentially in line with what we expected and Rob's going to walk you through the details, but this is a positive outcome obviously as it gives us a degree of capital and liquidity flexibility beyond what we already have today. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work in the third quarter and their continued focus on serving our customers, the communities that we live in and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results and then we'll take your questions. Rob? Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported third quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.94 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew $2.8 billion or 1% to $238 billion linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, growth was $14.4 billion or 6%. Investment securities of $85.2 billion increased $1.5 billion or 2% linked quarter primarily due to purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Year-over-year, total securities balances increased $4.4 billion or 5%. Our deposits at the Fed averaged $15.3 billion for the third quarter, up $2.1 billion linked quarter. Deposits grew $6.2 billion or 2% linked quarter and $16.6 billion or 6% year-over-year. We continue to maintain strong capital ratios. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital through dividends of $516 million and share repurchases of $1 billion. Since the third quarter of 2018, we've reduced our shares outstanding by 23 million or 5%. As of September 30, 2019, our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%, down slightly from 9.7% as of June 30, 2019. As Bill mentioned, the Federal Reserve released the final regulatory tailoring rules last week and as expected, the rules are largely unchanged from the original proposals and are generally favorable to our liquidity and capital ratios. There are three significant impacts from a financial perspective for PNC. One, we'll get relief on threshold deductions in our CET1 capital calculation. Two, we'll have the choice to opt out of the inclusion of AOCI in capital. And three, our LCR requirement will be lowered to 85% from 100% currently. If the rules were effective on September 30, we estimate that the threshold deduction changes would generate a benefit of approximately 70 basis points to our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, while the impact of opting out of AOCI would reduce that benefit by approximately 15 basis points. Through LCR relief, we would have flexibility to potentially increase net interest income between $20 million and $50 million annualized by reducing debt, redeploying excess liquidity in loans and securities, or a combination thereof. Our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.36%. Our return on average common equity was 11.6%, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%. Our tangible book value was $82.37 per common share as of September 30, an increase of 13% compared to a year ago. Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Loans grew $2.8 billion or 1% over the second quarter, with growth in both commercial and consumer lending. Commercial lending balances increased $1.3 billion or 1%, primarily in our real estate and corporate banking businesses. Included in this growth was an increase in our average multifamily warehouse balances of approximately $700 million. On the consumer side, balances increased $1.5 billion or 2% linked quarter driven by growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card, somewhat offset by runoff in our home equity and education loans. While not shown on the slide, spot loans increased approximately $200 million quarter-over-quarter. Consumer balances increased $1.6 billion, while commercial balances declined $1.4 billion, which was primarily driven by a decrease in our multifamily warehouse balances of $1.1 billion. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans grew 6% or $14.4 billion. Commercial lending balances increased $11.6 billion or 8%, and consumer balances were higher by $2.8 billion or 4%. Average deposits increased $6.2 billion or 2% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter driven by seasonal growth in commercial deposits. Growth was primarily in interest-bearing deposits. However, noninterest-bearing deposits posted a modest increase as well. It's worth noting that spot deposits increased $12.3 billion or 5% compared to June 30, 2019 and included approximately $4 billion of balances related to a sweep deposit product we began offering our asset management clients in September. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average deposits increased $16.6 billion or 6%. As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances declined primarily as a result of lower LIBOR rates during the third quarter. And importantly, our rates paid on deposits reached an inflection point, having declined 1 basis point linked quarter. As you can see on slide 6, third quarter total revenue was $4.5 billion, up $54 million linked quarter and $136 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. Net interest income, noninterest expense and provision were all relatively stable compared with the second quarter. Total noninterest income increased $48 million or 2% linked quarter, reflecting higher fee income, partially offset by an expected decline in other noninterest income. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.5%. For the full year 2019 we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 7, net interest income of $2.5 billion was up slightly by $6 million compared with the second quarter. The growth reflects higher interest-earning asset balances and an additional day, partially offset by the impact of lower rates. Net interest income grew $38 million or 2% year-over-year driven by higher earning asset balances and yields, which were partially offset by higher funding costs and balances. Net interest margin decreased to 2.84% in the third quarter, mostly due to the net effect of lower interest rates, primarily LIBOR. Although lower rates reduced our borrowing costs, that was more than offset by the impact of LIBOR on our commercial loan yields. Separately, deposit rates began to decrease during the quarter and we expect that decline to continue during the fourth quarter at a faster pace. Noninterest income of $2 billion increased $48 million or 2% linked quarter as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Importantly, fee income grew 5% over the second quarter. The main drivers of the increase were Asset Management revenue increased $19 million due to higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock. Consumer Services increased $10 million attributable to higher brokerage revenue and seasonally higher debit and credit card transaction volumes. Corporate Services declined $15 million, primarily due to a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights and M&A advisory fees. Residential mortgage noninterest income increased $52 million due to RMSR hedge gains as well as higher refinancing volumes. And service charges on deposits increased $7 million, reflecting a seasonal increase in consumer spending. Finally, other noninterest income was $342 million. The $25 million linked quarter decline reflects lower asset sales related to the second quarter gain on the sale of the retirement recordkeeping business, partially offset by higher revenue from private equity investments. In the fourth quarter, we expect other noninterest income to be in a range of $300 million to $350 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. This includes the estimated gain from the previously announced sale of our proprietary mutual funds, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 8, third quarter expenses remained relatively flat linked quarter with an increase of $12 million. Personnel expense increased $35 million, largely as a result of higher compensation related to business activity and an additional day in the quarter. Importantly, every other expense category declined quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the same period a year ago, expenses increased minimally by $15 million. Our efficiency ratio was 58% in the third quarter, improving from 59% for last quarter and 60% a year ago. And importantly, we continue to generate positive operating leverage. Expense management continues to be a focus for us and our expenses have been well controlled due in large part to our continuous improvement program. Through the first three quarters of the year, we're on track to achieve our annual target of $300 million in expense savings, which as you know contribute to funding our technology and business investments. Turning to credit quality, our metrics are presented on slide 9 and remained strong. Provision for credit losses was $183 million, a $3 million increase linked quarter, as a lower provision for commercial loans was slightly offset by a higher provision for consumer loans, principally in auto and credit card. Net charge-offs increased $13 million to $155 million linked quarter, and our annualized net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points. Overall, our allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1.15% as of September 30, 2019, virtually unchanged for the previous five quarters. Nonperforming loans were up $4 million, essentially flat linked quarter. Nonperforming loans to total loans represent 73 basis points, consistent with the previous quarter, but down from a year ago. Total delinquencies were up $39 million or 3% linked quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in auto and credit card delinquencies, partially due to seasonality. As you know, we're approaching the adoption of CECL, the new accounting standard for credit losses, which will go into effect January 1, 2020. We've been in parallel run since the beginning of this year and based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of September 30, 2019, we estimate that CECL could result in an overall allowance increase of approximately 20% as compared to our current aggregate reserve levels. We continue to expect the increase to be driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longer duration assets require more reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, this remains an approximation and we'll further refine this estimate through year-end. In summary, PNC posted very good third quarter results. For the balance of this year, we expect continued growth in GDP, albeit at a slower pace. We continue to expect one 25 basis point cut in Fed funds rate in October. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter 2019 compared to third quarter 2019 reported results, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. We expect net interest income to decline approximately 1%. We expect fee income to be stable to up 1% as growth in our fee generating activities is expected to more than offset the elevated RMSR hedge gains in the third quarter. We expect other noninterest income to be between $300 million and $350 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect expenses to be up approximately 1%. Importantly, given our expense management efforts, we remain well positioned to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2019. And we expect provision to be between $175 million and $225 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Thank you.  And our first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Good morning. Hey. Good morning, John. John. Bill, I think at a conference presentation in the quarter you had talked about 2020 net interest income and thought that it could be potentially flat or maybe down 1% or so given the backdrop and given what you're looking at for rates. Can you just give us your updated thoughts there based upon how the curve is looking right now and Fed expectations  (16:03)? What we can think about for NII for the year? Thanks. I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on 2020, but since I talked about it before, we haven't seen a dramatic change. So we talked about kind of down 1%, I think, on forwards. It's maybe a little bit worse than that today but not a whole lot. Okay. All right. Thanks. That's helpful. And then separately, in terms of the newer market expansion, I wanted to get an idea if you have any indication on the returns that you're beginning to see in some of these newer markets where you've entered with both a lending product as well as your deposit gathering but you've gone in branch-light. So some of these newer markets, are you able to assess the profitability for some of these markets? And how they are comparing now to some of your traditional brick and mortar markets? Yeah, I mean, two separate thoughts. So the middle market expansion we've kind of talked about a three-year breakeven per market, and if anything we're kind of running ahead of that. And of course as we go through the aging of the markets we've entered a handful of years ago, they start coming online on an accelerated basis, which is one of the things you're seeing show up I guess in some of our loan growth. On the retail side, at this point it's clearly a net investment. But what we would tell you is that the solution centers we're building are breaking even probably a bit faster than a traditional de novo branch even though they are paying in effect market-leading rates. So the deposit growth rate is three and four and five times higher in some cases than what we would typically see. But that whole investment on the retail side at this point is an investment and is a net drain, but it is something long term that I think is important for our franchise. And we're encouraged by the early results. Yeah, it's all going to plan thus far. Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask one more, on the expense side or at least the operating leverage side, I know you expect – you're still confident on positive operating leverage for the year for 2019. Can you just talk about your expectations for 2020 in terms of the magnitude you may be looking to achieve for the year? Hey, John. It's Rob. Yeah, absolutely. For 2019, we feel very good. We've run with positive operating leverage all year, and we expect to complete that for the full year. 2020, it's premature. We haven't started our budgeting process yet, so we haven't worked through it all. So don't have anything for you this morning on that, but we'll get to it later in the year and certainly on our fourth quarter earnings call. Okay. Thanks. Understood. Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Hey, Erika. Good morning. My first question is just a follow-up on the tailoring rule. And we really appreciate all the detail that you provided. As we think about the 70 basis point impact to CET1 or a net 55 basis points, should we think about that as the amount allocated to an additional buyback? And if so, one of your peers mentioned going back to the Fed during this CCAR year and asking for that. So just wanted a little bit of color on that. Yeah, sure. Sure, Erika. This is Rob. So, yeah, so the tailoring rule is largely favorable from a capital perspective. The threshold sort of relief adds 70 basis points. As of now, you have to subtract 15 basis points for AOCI, presuming that you opt out, which is a fairly good assumption, but we haven't made that decision yet. I think in regard to what our plans are for that capital, once the rules are finally implemented, which we expect to be somewhere in the early part of 2020, that would coincide with our CCAR process. So we would take it up then in terms of what we would do from that new, at that time, official higher capital position. Yeah, the one thing I'd mention, we obviously have a large buyback ongoing today, and part of what we will need to do work on in the 2020 CCAR is to look at the actual impact post-stress of some of these changes. So we have a benefit on a spot basis, as Rob said, net 55 basis points, including AOCI. But we actually benefit a bit more in a severe stress because of a larger bucket in  the syn bucket (20:59) effect. We need to work that through. As you know, that just becomes more punitive in a severe scenario. Yeah. So, in effect, our target ratio has the opportunity to decline from what we've said historically. But we'll have guidance on that as we get into the new year. Got it. I see. And just a follow-up, taking a step back. Obviously, the forward curve has been completely unpredictable. The October percentage in terms of the rate cut has increased just in the past few hours. But as I just think about the business opportunities in terms of actually just executing strategy, the pace of business growth and lending growth as we think out to 2020, fully acknowledging all the different – that the economy could be slowing down, there's the volatility of presidential election, does it feel like this pace of business growth can continue in 2020? I think it can. I mean, part of what gives us the degree of confidence we have is just the market expansion that we've done. So we've been able to grow, in effect, by pulling share in newer markets without having to push on credit risk or other levers. And importantly, we've been able to grow fees concurrent with growing clients. I think that will continue. For the overall economy, the consumer's holding it up today as manufacturing weakens and we'll see how long that is sustainable. The final comment I'd make and I appreciate your comment on the fact that the forward curve's swinging all over the place, we put a NII guidance. And part of the issue, of course, is in the course of the last week, we've seen a Fed move get taken off the table, put back on the table, taken off. Right, right. And so when I get a question as to what NII is going to do next year, the best way I got to answer it is to say that no matter what happens here, it's not a big move from where we are. We're not dependent on it. On a given day last week, I would have told you that it would have been down less than 1%. But the day after that it was going to be more. 1.5%, yeah. Yeah, so it isn't critical to our business model at this point. We can obviously survive it. We feel really comfortable about growing clients and the related portfolio of products that we serve those clients with, which gives us good fee momentum. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning. Hi, Betsy. Good morning. Just one quick follow-up on that. When you think about the NII outlook, I understand it's not really a major driver of what you're going to be able to do, but just wondering the 1%, does that include the LCR benefit you talked about, it's like 30 to 80 bps or something like that? No. No, no. No, it doesn't. No. No. Okay. All right. Yeah, so LCR would be ameliorating that outlook. Okay. Got it. And then, I guess the other thing I get questions on, more from like cross-asset class investors is we're seeing some little, I don't know, I don't even want to call it stress, but we're seeing a little bit of cracks in like maybe CLOs or leveraged loans, spreads are beginning to widen. But then I look at your results and others, and corporate just looks fantastic. So why do you think that is? Why do you think we're in some parts of the market seeing a little bit of stress, but in other parts of the market, we're not seeing delinquencies go up meaningfully? And I know you've got a big C&I book, so I thought it would be a good question to you. I'm trying to figure out how to answer that question without being critical of nonbank lenders. Good luck. Yeah. I think that participants who pushed on credit to get deals struggle when there's any slowdown at all, and of course we've seen that in manufacturing, so it's starting to show up in some of the credit stats. We didn't push on that box. To the extent that the economy slows and our clients get downgraded, we'll have elevated provision through time. But we just really haven't seen a crack with systemic risk across any part of our portfolio. Because deliberately, we're not at the line or on the edge, which these others are. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then the quality of your book, obviously we see coming through in like delinquencies and NCOs and things like that, and I don't know if there's any other details you could give maybe in the Q or K or something like that around ratings and rankings. I suppose you do already, and I just need to find it. But that would be helpful, just given your scale. Our criticized and classified stuff is out there. It's probably what we disclosed to you. But bizarrely, our corporate guys would probably – well, not probably, they would definitely tell you that a slowdown ultimately helps that business. It might hurt in the immediate term, but asset-based lending spreads increase, business volumes... Less competition. Yeah, less competition across the whole space. So we're fine with where we sit. It's the same book we've had for the last 15 years. Yeah, got it. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, Scott. Good morning. Hey. I just wanted to ask on the other noninterest income guide, so the $300 million to $350 million in the fourth quarter is higher than the typical $250 million to $300 million, and it includes that business sale gain that you guys will close hopefully in the fourth quarter. So I guess I'm just curious if you could either, one, give sort of order of magnitude of that anticipated gain, or two, are we getting to a point where you have enough of a confidence that we sort of stay in this more elevated range? No, no, I think, Scott, that's a good question and you're right, historically that we have some volatility in that category quarter-over-quarter, but it tends to average out at around $300 million. So if you look at the last three quarters of 2019 and then the previous four quarters in 2018, you do that average, it's around $300 million. Our low I think was the first quarter of 2018 which was $249 million and our high was second quarter of 2019 which was $364 million. So that just gives you a sense of the order of magnitude, but it averages out around $300 million. I'm guiding up for the fourth quarter above that because of the announced sale of our proprietary mutual funds which is about that magnitude. So we're going up about $50 million. Yeah, the $300 million to $350 million, and that's why. Everything else is as we would expect. Okay. Okay. That's perfect. I appreciate the clarity on that. Yeah, sure. And then I was hoping if I could switch gears just a second to just the competitive dynamic on overall deposit costs. It sounds like you guys are pretty confident about an acceleration in decline in deposit costs in the fourth quarter. Maybe just some broad thoughts on what you see going on. And are these just natural longer-term stuff sort of rolling off, or are you having some success in taking down rates, et cetera? I mean, I'll start, Rob, and you can jump in. Okay. I think, and you've heard us talk about this. We aren't fighting for deposits per se today. So our loan to deposit ratio was kind of around the level it's always been, in the low 80s. We have taken down our rate on the national digital strategy, so we're not one of the top posters there. We have been able to lower consumer promo rates and still grow deposits and households the way we want to. So it seems to be working. The one thing I would tell you is that the one place where we see a lot of competition, we saw it throughout the third quarter and continuing, is in small business banking where rate paid for small businesses, which give rise to a big chunk of deposits that are sort of retail-like is really high. And that's one of the reasons our deposit costs didn't decline as much as they otherwise would have in the third quarter. But that's the one spot I can think of... Well, I think that's – yeah, that's clearly an impact. It's also – just a lot of the moves that we made following the July rate cut are starting to take hold. So on the consumer side, you're just going to see rates that actions we've already made now show up in full force in the fourth quarter. Yeah. But it hasn't affected our flows. No, no. Yeah, perfect. All right. That's terrific. Thank you, guys. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning. Rob, I was wondering... Hi, John. ...if I could just ask you about the dynamics around the outlook for NII next quarter. You've got the average loans up and NII down a little bit. I guess with the deposit pricing maybe inflecting down, could we see the NIM decline a little bit less next quarter than this, or there's some other factors at play there? Yeah. Maybe, John. You're on it. That's the calculation. I think the biggest variable will be one month LIBOR and how that affects our commercial loan yields. I think that's the biggest sort of unknown variable and we'll have to see. Yeah, yeah, so you've got the loans up. So you're expecting some agree of margin compression, you're not sure how much, but overall guess is NII down a little bit. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. The other thing that's rolling through everybody's income statement to one degree or another is amortization cost on mortgage-backed securities. Right, premium. So, the premium amort, and we actually benefited a little bit in the third quarter versus what we thought we would have because rates sold off. I think that's going to drive a lot of people and that will impact us at the margin as well, which is of course longer-term rates, the 10-year more so than what's happening in the front end. Okay. Is that a little bit of a delayed impact of what happened already in the 10-year, Bill? No, it – I mean, in the end, right, if the 10-year trades around 150 basis points for – I'm making up a number for the quarter, prepays are much higher. If it's up in the 70s, they're much lower. We put a forecast out there. It was somewhere in between. So that... That's your plus or minus. ...swings around $5 million or $10 million either way. And we have a small mortgage book relative to others, so I think that's an industry phenomenon right now that's causing – forecasting this number to be a little tough. Got it. And then just on the 2020 outlook, understanding it's too early to get too precise there, but assuming in that outlook which is generally reassuring about the ability to kind of grow with the forwards and keep NII relatively to a small decline, Rob, you're kind of assuming in those simulations loan growth in the same ballpark that you've had kind of mid-single digit-ish type of thing in that simulation? Lower. Yeah, a little. Yeah. Still loan growth more in line with our strategic plan, which is lower mid-single digits. So, a little less than we've done this year. Yeah, a little less, so for  5.5, 6 (33:05), a little less than that. Lower end of mid? Lower end of mid, yeah, right. Higher end of low. But nothing heroic. Yeah, nothing heroic, that's right. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Hi, Matt. I kind of focus more on the average loans and deposits, but you did reference the period end jump and deposits, in part driven by the new sweep strategy in Asset Management... Yes. Right. ...and obviously period end loans were flat. So I guess the first question is, should we think about the jumping off point more using the period end than average, and then if so what do you do with all those extra deposits both that you got this quarter and that will come in from the sweep effort that you have? Well, so I'll jump in on some of that and see if that answers your question. I think on the loans, the spot being below the average was entirely due to the multifamily sort of seasonal spike and some activity spike that we saw in the third quarter. So our loan guidance for the balance of – or the fourth quarter is up approximately 1%, so we account for that. We see good activity coming up off those spot numbers in the fourth quarter. And then on deposits, we like deposits. More deposits are good. The AMG sweep was a bit of one-timer, but everything else is in line with what we would have expected. Hey, and Matt, that loan growth guidance is off of average balances. Yeah, yeah, it's off – I'm sorry, the loan guidance is off average but even with the spot we'll make the average. Yeah. Okay. And the Asset Management sweep is just a onetime $4 billion versus the... It will vary around there. It's something most of our peers have done in the past. We just kind of moved it over and offered it to our clients. So maybe it will grow with our client franchise but not beyond that. Right. Okay. Helpful. And then just separately, the proprietary mutual fund business that you're selling, should we be mindful of the revenue and expense kind of impact going forward? Have you provided those numbers? No, we haven't. And they're immaterial. Okay. And just remind us, what's left with kind of the PNC, I guess you used to call like advisor and the strategy there? So within our Asset Management Group we have three segments, PNC Wealth Management, our Institutional Investments and Hawthorn which collectively we manage in excess of $300 billion in assets for our clients. So the sale of the proprietary business, Matt, was really something that was a return to our past. Prior to – a lot of the acquisitions that we made, when I ran the business we didn't have proprietary mutual funds. We were committed to open architecture, which we still are. Through the acquisitions that we made – and maybe this is more than you want to know, through the years we picked those up and they were good, but our core philosophy is advisory and the open architecture is much, much more conducive to that. Yeah, and the only monies – another way to answer the question, we basically won't be in the manufacturing business except for some small, short-term liquidity funds that we run for corporates in the institutional side. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Why, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, on the fee side, it's good to see that the outlook is stable to plus 1%, especially given that you had that pretty healthy MSR gain this quarter of $40 million. So I know there's some normal seasonality, but can you kind of talk us through just what your expectations are, especially given your prior answer that there's not a material loss from the sale of the mutual fund business; just how you expect things to trend within where the leaders and laggards are? Thanks. Sure. Sure. Just on the fee side by category, approximation. Asset Management we'd expect to be sort of stable, maybe up a little bit. Consumer Services up a bit, consistent with what they've been doing for some time on a quarterly basis. The big driver for the fourth quarter in terms of our increase will be on the Corporate Services side, which typically has a higher fourth quarter and our pipelines would indicate that. And then mortgage is probably stable to down a little bit just because of the RMSRs and maybe some margin compression. Great. Understood. Okay. Thanks, Rob. As a follow-on, on the commercial side, just bigger picture, the state of the commercial customer you just mentioned you have still good pipelines on Harris Williams. Any changes to what you're seeing in the conversations and dialogues with the commercial customers, willingness to do deals, invest in plant and equipment, et cetera? Just given the big picture points that Bill made in his intro. Thanks. The only – I mean, look, it's been muted and we're hearing that from our customers, as they're cautious in this environment that the way you would expect them to be. We have seen, for what it's worth, given the recent rate rally, a lot of hedging activity. One of the things that's inside of our other line, Rob, is our capital markets, FX and derivative activity. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that has picked up a lot, which is a big driver of fees inside the other line. But, no, there hasn't been a turnaround in sentiment on the corporate side. Small business is different. They're still bullish. Yeah, right. And the consumer is still bullish. But the larger corporate is holding back and we're seeing that. And one more thing, just on the commercial side. Rob, your point on commercial fees, is that both the CMBS business and Harris Williams or are they both acting pretty well? Yeah, yeah, they both are. They're both acting pretty well. TM as well, right? And, oh yeah, Treasury Management, of course. Yeah. Yeah. So Treasury Management's the largest component, but sometimes seasonal or quarterly variances come more through Harris Williams in M&A advisory. Yeah. And capital markets. And capital markets. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. So your efficiency improved 60% to 58% year-over-year. My question relates to how much of that is driven by what you're doing in the back office with technology. And could you just give us some more information about kind of what you're doing behind the scenes with tech? Like, I don't know, number of data centers at the peak, number of data centers you have now and where that might go, or how much you've enabled to go to the public cloud? Or how far along you are with that or some other metrics that show kind of what you're doing with your technological infrastructure? I don't know how to answer that question inside of four hours. Mike, I think what technology has enabled us to do is to continue to grow the franchise without growing the kind of core cost base. And you're starting to see that show up on the positive operating leverage we have. There's a million little benefits that we get that are too numerous to name, from everything on how fast it is to spin up a server to how quickly you can change an app and release it, to the offerings we have for our commercial clients in Pinnacle on our TM side on – all of these things at the margin make a difference. The savings we are getting finally out of the mortgage business, having replaced the servicing and origination platforms there and the digital experience we're offering to customers. So technology is showing up everywhere in the way we service our customers, and it's showing up in our operating leverage, simply because it's allowing to scale without a commensurate increase in cost. So maybe that's the simplest answer I could give you. I know you're asking with your technology hat on, so I'll spend a second on what we're doing in core data center and cloud and cloud hybrid. We have chosen, for the time being, to basically run a hybrid model, so we have an internal cloud. We have the capability through a container layer to burst through to public cloud when we need it for excess compute, for test environments and other things where it's efficient to do so. We will run that hybrid model. Our plan is into the future. We do not see a benefit in cost savings by going to pure cloud at least in an environment that we think we want to operate in as it relates to security and soundness and safety in cyber and so forth. As you know, we've been at this for the better part of probably seven years now, so most of those investments are kind of behind us and you're also starting to see that show up... Well, the decrease (43:02)... ...with the decrease in the acceleration of our equipment line. Right. And  our height (43:05) data centers was 13, and now we're 3. Yeah, yeah. Is that enough? Yeah. Yeah, no, that's good. No, look, I think you summed it up. Tech allows you to grow without growing expenses, 13 data centers down to 3. So kind of – I'm just – one more attempt. I think you guys have done a little bit more with the cloud or cloud enabling your apps. How many apps do you have? And how many might eventually go to the cloud? I know that's very technical and specific. Just a little bit more meat on the bone. But apps – but, Mike, apps don't run in the cloud. Yeah. I'm thinking of an app as a digital app. An application runs in the cloud. Virtually 100% of our applications today are cloud enabled. So we're cloud native for everything. Our choice to put it in a public cloud is our choice. It is not a decision to or a work set we have to do to enable that application to then run in a cloud. Every system that can be cloud enabled has been cloud enabled at this point. Yeah. Yeah. In fact... That's what you mean about having done the hard work. So you've cloud enabled. So now that you have a choice, what percent do you think you might eventually transition to the public cloud? I think it will be a small percentage. We'll certainly use it for some of our test environments where we need compute and tests tend to have the potential to take servers down. Right, right. And there's certain of our noncritical information applications that we could choose to run in the cloud, and of course we have vendors who run in the cloud. And I should clarify, Mike, we still are dependent for certain applications on mainframe. And that is the last nut to crack for banks to get some of their core operations off of mainframe, and we are not entirely there yet. Sure. That's helpful. All right. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Good morning. Hi, Kevin. Just in regard to the consumer, some of the consumer lending picked up quite a bit in the third quarter. And I'm assuming some of that is seasonality, but you also saw quite a bit of pick-up in auto and residential real estate. Is there anything in particular that's occurring in the consumer that you're seeing a pick-up, whether it's internally at PNC or just in general with seasonality? The only thing that I think is perhaps different is on the mortgage side, the residential side, just the volume that we're doing through the new technology. So our volume is up. I don't know what the percentage is quarter on quarter or year on year, Rob, but high percentages. And frankly, without kind of the new system running in the background, we wouldn't have been able to do that volume. So that's probably the only real change. We've been at the credit card game, largely converting our existing clients to our lending products, we've been at that for a long period of time and continue to have success. That's the biggest driver. Yeah. We've had a strategic objective to grow our consumer loan book, which was and still is under-penetrated relative to what we can do. So strong growth in card, auto, residential mortgage reflecting that. And we've seen headwinds on delinquency and loss rates on the auto side. Will that change any of your appetite in the near term, given you've been growing that portfolio quite a bit in the last year? Delinquencies are up at the margin partly due to seasonality but also partly due to some vintages a year or so back and inside of our risk band but at the lower end of prime, and it's likely we'll dial that back in terms of originations. In truth, we've already done that, though, so I don't know that you're going to see that slow down our growth. It's just we won't be in the bucket that's causing the roll forward and the spike in delinquencies you're seeing. Okay. So we should see a little bit of a settling down just because of the mix of the back book versus the front book. Is that the way to think about it? I think so. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy, RBC. Please go ahead. Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Rob. Hey, Gerard. Gerard. Bill, can you expand upon – obviously you've had success in growing outside the traditional PNC footprint with your Treasury Management products on the commercial side. In the wins that you've had, can you share with us what's driving the wins? Is it the quality of the product? Or do you price it so attractively that the person wants it or the company wants it? And then you can cross-sell other products into it to better build that relationship? What's really leading that success? Well, it is not pricing. We don't differentiate in pricing new markets, old markets or established markets. Look, we hire really good people and we're very patient. So what you're seeing is today as a result of seeds that we planted three and four and even five years ago, if you go back to some of the stuff we've done in the Southeast, we hired good bankers. We call, we have good ideas. We eventually get a shot and then our TM product is such that once you get in the door, we have the ability to continue to show new ideas. We're always working with them. And the ability to kind of upsell the initial offering, given all the products we have in TM, is pretty strong. Through time we moved from being a participant in somebody else's credit deal to being rightly the  left lead (49:20), and that's just played out for us. You start with good people. You're consistent. You show good ideas. You have good products and services. You pick the right clients to begin with so that when we enter a market we know the top 50 clients we want to bank. We don't get the 50 that will have us, so we'll be very patient to get the right 50, and we've been at this for a while, so it's starting to play out. And I would add to that, and we've covered this on previous calls. That so-called top 50 that we target that Bill pointed out, the receptivity of those companies to our calling effort is very high. So once you're accepted and that receptivity is encouraged, then we're just running our plays like we do everywhere else. We know how to compete. The key is the ability to have that dialogue. What's the number... Go ahead, Bill. I was going to say – how many markets have we opened since Mike started this? (50:20) We've grown from 12 to 30 and we're at 22, so we've opened 10. So we basically have been – if you think about the investment we've put into it, right, we invested dollars, negative carry in 10 new markets and people and community support and everything else, so we're finally starting to get the return on that investment. Yeah. That's right. Very good. And when you target those markets, you mentioned these 50 companies that you target, what's the sales size of a typical success story? Is it somebody with $250 million in revenue or quite a bit higher or lower? It's all over the place. I mean, we do less on the commercial side, the smaller commercial, more on the mid-market to large corporate. But I would tell you one of our largest wins this year was a Fortune 100 company in a new market. So it just depends. We happen to have a solution at that particular point. (51:24) Yeah. I think it's fairly similar, like you say. But those new markets  would be different than a (51:27) legacy. The lower end isn't there. Yes. It's middle market and above. Very good. And coming back to profitability, you addressed the issues on capital and potentially giving back more capital next year with the tailoring rules which obviously would boost your ROE. When you look at PNC going back many, many years, and I know the world has changed from the 1990s when PNC was able to earn ROAs in the high 1% range, and I'm not suggesting you can get there today because of the new regulations you all have to deal with. But what do you think peak profitability for a company like yours today from not so much an ROE standpoint, but more from an ROA standpoint, is it where you are now, or is there actually room for improvement to bring it up to north of 150 basis points on ROA? I don't know. You can come up with so many iterations. Look, our margin – I was looking at this the other day – our margin coming out of the crisis was  408 (52:30), including our accretion accounting. So... Right, right. Right, yeah. Right. Right. Give me low provisions and the right interest rate environment and I'll... Kind of poor handle on (52:39) your margin, yeah. We'll show you a return on assets that's high. I think through time, right, drivers, take the interest rate curve out for a second, I think through time our growth in fees continues and that, if anything, becomes a larger percentage of what we do, which in turn will drive up our ROA, all else equal, across the interest rate environment and the basic notion that we aren't changing our credit mix. But whether you can go from where we are today to 150 basis points is dependent I think more on the yield curve than what we can do in fees. Yeah, and it's a math drill. Yeah. Got you. All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to capital and your capital strategy. Your CET1 is 9.6. Even if you opt out of the OCI, tailoring takes you to 10.1. CECL is not really a material hit to your capital base, the Day One impact at least. I believe you guys have said your optimal capital, optimal CET1 is around 8.5, and I think you mentioned you could even bring that down further. I mean, once you get some of the questions that you kind of laid out, answered on stress losses, how quickly can you bring your CET1 down to optimal levels, assuming no real acceleration in risk-weighted asset growth? Is this over a CCAR cycle, over a few CCAR cycles? How do we think about the glide path down to what an optimal capital level is? You hit all the variables. Your numbers are basically right. Right. Numbers are good. Yeah, and it is the right question. But I think we owe you further guidance on that and I'm just not going to give it until we get into the fourth quarter and start working on next year's CCAR. I mean, obviously, we could buy it down quickly. I don't know if that is the best thing to do for shareholder value long-term. I think notwithstanding the near-term ROE impact, the practical implications of carrying excess capital, that's what we – if that's what we choose to do, isn't material long-term as long as we don't waste that capital, right. We're good stewards of the capital. So whether we buy it down in a hurry or we do it through the course of a year, we'll get to the right place and we'll do it intelligently and we'll give you more background on that as we start the work on CCAR 2020. Yeah, and having that additional flexibility is a good thing. Yeah. Got it. What are some of the variables you think about in terms of answering that question for yourself in terms of like how quickly you're getting there. Yeah, the biggest one right now is the opportunity that might be presented by some of the chaos in the market. If in fact – we don't believe this to be the case but if in fact there's a slowdown, we'll use that slowdown to accelerate. I think there'll be a lot of opportunities for us to do that. So I'd hate to be in a place where for the sake of driving up ROE near term or a few cents per share that we get from buyback, I'd hate to be in a place that we can't take strategic advantage of a slowdown to grow assets and clients and so forth. But that's the biggest one. And the intelligence required, rather than just a... Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. That's helpful. If I could change gears a little bit, how do you think about how the lower rate environment impacts your national digital strategy, if at all? You have been using higher-cost CDs as sort of a client acquisition tool in these markets and with lower rates, arguably, that becomes more – or becomes less attractive, those CDs. Does a lower rate environment, you think, hinder your ability to grow in expansion markets? First, to clarify, we haven't been using CDs. It's kind of been posted money market rates... (57:00). ...and we've in the course of our sort of experimentation across markets, we've probably grown 20% to 25% of our total clients in straight traditional DDA account, our Virtual Wallet product. So that's less impacted by rates. Obviously, the yield seekers will be less active in a lower rate environment and we take that into account as we think about this going forward. It's one of the reasons why we continue to think our branches matter. It's one of the reasons brand matters. It's one of the reasons feet on the ground matters. So all of that stuff we're thinking about as we plan for the future. And it's not simply – that strategy is not simply reliant on high rates. Yeah. Right. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thank you. We have no further questions. All right. Well, thank you, everybody, and we'll see you in the fourth quarter. Thank you. Yeah. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

         "Q3 2019 Earnings Call",
         "Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Pinnacle Financial Partners' Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Hosting the call today from Pinnacle Financial Partners is Mr. Terry Turner, Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Harold Carpenter, Chief Financial Officer. Please note, Pinnacle's earnings release and this morning's presentation are available on the Investor Relations page of their website at www.pnfp.com. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Pinnacle's website for the next 90 days. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. Before we begin, Pinnacle does not provide earnings guidance or forecasts.

All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other facts that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Pinnacle Financial to differ materially from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many of such factors are beyond Pinnacle Financial's ability to control or predict and listeners are cautioned not to put undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. A more detailed description of these and other risks is contained in Pinnacle Financial's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pinnacle Financial disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, these remarks may include certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures will be available on Pinnacle Financial's website at www.pnfp.com. With that, I am now going to turn the presentation over to Mr. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and CEO. Thanks, Joelle. Good morning. As we always do, I'll begin with this dashboard. As a reminder, it's focused on revenue growth, earnings growth and asset quality because we believe that they're the three most highly correlated metrics to long-term shareholder returns. Consequently, that's what we focus on quarter in and quarter out. As you can see, Q3 was an extraordinary quarter for our firm with 15.6% year-over-year growth in revenue, 19% year-over-year growth in EPS, and outstanding asset quality metrics. With all the noise and adjustments primarily in previous period, in many cases, the non-GAAP measures better illustrate the relative performance of our firm. As a reminder, the reason we began each quarterly earnings call with data that goes back to 1Q 2014 is because, as you can see, any impact from M&A, high deposit betas, outsized CRE payoffs or any number of other hot buttons that have come and gone over the last five years, our balance sheet growth and, more importantly, our growth in revenue and EPS has been remarkably rapid and reliable. And Q3 2019 is a continuation of the same. When you look at the slope on any of those growth metrics there, we've got a 34% five-year CAGR for revenues, 22% five-year CAGR for EPS, a 16% five-year CAGR for tangible book value, a 34% five-year CAGR for loans, a 36% five-year CAGR for deposits, an ROTCE now north of 18%, and pristine asset quality metrics quarter-in and quarter-out. One of Peter Drucker's more famous quotes that I've used a number of times on these calls is that culture eats strategy for lunch. The folks at Gallup and the Great Place to Work Institute subsequently developed the empirical data that proves exactly that, specifically the companies that have higher levels of employee engagement produce better sales results, lower employee turnover, which frankly is or should be a critical success criterion for most everybody, better productivity and better profitability. So, in my opinion our obsession with culture is the explanation for the reliable slope on all those charts we just looked at on the previous slide. On this slide, you see a list of the workplace recognitions that we've received just in the last 12 months. And the ones in green – the green-shaded areas there are the ones that we received during the third quarter. We had two major  (00:05:03). Number one, we moved into Memphis in 2015 and quickly were recognized as the Best Place to Work amongst small or mid-sized companies in that market. Now, we're recognized as literally the Best Place to Work among the largest employers in Memphis. And number two, last year, immediately following our systems conversion associated with BNC integration, we were still ranked as the 19th best bank in America to work for and the only bank in the top 50 anywhere near our size. This year, we climbed another three spots up to number 16. So why is this important? It appears to me that we're headed into a sloppy operating environment. There's an old saying that you can't tell who's swimming naked till the tide goes out. Having such a highly engaged workforce not only produces better outcomes in the good times, it's even more critical to performance in the difficult times. I know by now everyone is familiar with the business case that we made for the BNC acquisition. The plan was to continue the high-growth CRE platforms BNC had and bolt on to that a C&I platform which is the principal strength of our firm. The critical path to make that happen was to lever our ongoing recruitment competence in order to attract and retain the best C&I and private bankers in the market. Specifically, when we announced the merger, we said we would hire 65 C&I and private bankers over a five-year period of time. As you can see, Rick Callicutt and his team surpassed the hiring target for C&I and private bankers in less than half that time. The environment for looking at great bankers in the Carolinas and Virginia has only gotten better since we launched our transaction there, and so we expect to continue to hire at a rapid pace there. Why is this making a difference? Number one, it's an indication that we're diligent about hitting our targets. But more importantly, number two, given all the turmoil in the industry and particularly in the southeastern markets that we target, there's an unprecedented opportunity to acquire talent from larger, more vulnerable banks, and we're arguably best positioned to seize it. And number three, it should allay fears that our rapid hiring will destroy our efficiency. At the time we announced this deal, our efficiency ratio as adjusted was 49.65%. And today we're at 47.58%, a meaningful improvement during the period when we have been doing the rapid hiring. With that backdrop, I'm going to turn it over to Harold to review the quarter in greater detail. Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We've updated our revenue per share slide for the third quarter results. We believe one of the best measurements whether we are winning or losing is shown on this slide. As you can see, we continue to experience double-digit revenue per share growth since the second quarter of last year. Secondly, the red dotted line represents the peer group's year-over-year growth. As shown on the slide, we outpaced our peers on revenue per share growth by a wide margin. Keeping in mind this is during the time of significant internal focus around the integration of the bank in North Carolina and more recently managing and strategizing around inverted yield curves. That said, our relationship managers have remained focused on gathering clients and generating incremental revenues for our firm. Obviously, BHG's outsized performance has had a meaningful influence on the results. We don't apologize for that at all. It has afforded us opportunities to invest in our franchise by keeping a foot on the accelerator on hiring, accruing for enhanced incentives to motivate our workforce as well as allowing us to better position our franchise for future growth. Additionally, BHG has provided for outsized tangible book value accretion, all of which benefits our franchise and its shareholders. There remains a lot of positive energy in our franchise right now, we remain on offense 24/7, it's all about winning. Our associates are engaged, focused, and excited about our opportunities for the remainder of this year and going into 2020. Now comparing the third quarter of 2019 average loans to the third quarter of 2018 average loans, our annualized growth was more than 11%. We continue to believe that our loan growth for 2019 will be low double digits in comparison to 2018. And this time, we have no reason to believe that our loan growth outlook for 2020 will be any different. We're in the midst of constructing our 2020 plan and our managers believe that low double digits is still a reasonable target. We can only make this statement because of the robustness of our hiring platform and the continued success we anticipate over the next several quarters. Impacting our volumes in the third quarter was the acquisition of Advocate Capital. We are excited about the opportunities that Advocate provides us including access to a vast network of attorneys where we can offer commercial banking products with emphasis initially on gathering the products. Advocate has built their franchise on delivering great service and enjoy significant depth in their client relationships. During the third quarter, Advocate added approximately $155 million in loan balances with a weighted average yield of 8% plus other fees for the services they provide their client base. I'll speak to loan rates in a second. We've shown this chart for several quarters now. We also provide information in the small chart regarding the granularity of our loan book by loan type. The small chart details the average commitment of our current loan book at origination compared to March 2015, the only outlier being construction. Construction has increased to an average commitment of almost $1.3 million, which we believe is a very reasonable amount for that part of our portfolio. We offer this information so that you can better appreciate that we're not relying on extra-large ticket sizes to hit our growth goals. The chart on the right details the impact of discount accretion on net interest income. As you can see by the gold line, discount accretion continues to be less impactful to our results at 5.7% of our net interest income in the third quarter and we believe will continue to be less impactful in the future. We all knew that a big headwind to our GAAP revenue growth for 2019 was an impact of less and less discount accretion. And the primary way we're going to overcome it was through balance sheet growth. Anyway, the blue bars on the chart on the right are, obviously, where our attention is. And growing those blue bars is key to our ability to deliver increased value to our shareholders. That said, hopefully in the not too distant future, we can stop showing this chart once purchase accounting is even more so in the rearview mirror. Next, here's another slide we've been showing for several quarters. It's an update on our loan portfolio by rate index. Our loan mix averages approximately 50% to 55% LIBOR and prime, which substantially all of the LIBOR credit being tied to 30-day LIBOR and about 40% fixed rate with commercial real estate being the primary contributor. The quarter-over-quarter weighted average coupon for LIBOR and prime-based credits for loan book decreased by 24 basis points for LIBOR and 43 basis points for prime, which is somewhat of a victory given we experienced 50 basis points in rate cuts. So the spread in this category has actually widened, very important in the quarter-end after considering a rate decrease. The increased significance of the spread on fixed rate credit as a proxy for fixed rate spread performance  (00:12:20) we traditionally use the five-year treasury as the benchmark. The five-year treasury dropped 21 basis points during the quarter while our average – weighted average fixed rate loan rate dropped only 6 basis points. Keeping the coupon on fixed rate loans near these levels would be a nice win for us in an anticipated down rate environment. Loan to deposits. Perhaps the most anticipated slide in the deck today. Average deposit balances were up $1.7 billion year-over-year. Our average deposit costs remained the same in the third quarter of 2019 from the second quarter and currently stand at 1.25%. (00:13:06). Let's go back to wholesale bank assets. We don't usually discuss the bond book for liquidity in our quarterly conference calls, but we're today primarily because it's relevant to margin performance in the third quarter and going forward. These two areas probably have the biggest downside impact on our NIM performance in the quarter. Bond yield decreased by 20 basis points linked quarter. This is by no means unexpected. We don't have a period added yet, so we believe period yields will see decreases this quarter as well, about 50% decline was due to reinvested cash flows while the other 50% was valuation of the book. So, when rates declined, the value of the book increased reducing the yield. We anticipate additional yield contraction in 4Q. But as the middle chart indicates, we've added more fixed rate assets to the bond book which will help stabilize our yield performance going into next year. As to liquidity, we maintained more this quarter than any quarter in recent memory. Most of this was timing in that we just completed a $300 million sub-debt offering in the second quarter of September, which added to our cash balances, and we acquired a large deposit from a long-time client of a similar amount. Regarding the offering, $180 million was injected into the bank while $90 million is earmarked for sub-debt reductions at the holding company in January. Most of the client deposit will find its way to our wealth management unit in the fourth quarter, while the remainder will be with us until early next year when that depositor pays their taxes. Liquidity will likely be back within its normal range in the fourth quarter. In any event, both of these matters pressured our third quarter margin performance. There is a point when NIM trumps net interest income, and we will pay attention. Currently, we will work with our clients to create as much credit income as we can and grow net interest income. As a wise buy side investor once said, there's value in vendor customers, especially those that transition to relationship based on service and advice. So, as a result, we remain focused on growing our client base by hiring the best bankers in our markets. Now, to deposits. Most of our firm's focus for the third quarter was on the table on the left which looks at end-of-period rates. Our relationship managers, we believe, did a bang-up job on managing our deposit cost in this rate environment. In the negotiated rate bucket, we've achieved a 17-basis point decline. At this point in the rate cycle, our target would be a 50-basis point beta or a 50% beta or a 25 basis points reduction, so we're very much pleased on where we are given the most recent rate decreases were late in the quarter. We do think we are getting close to the 25 basis point reduction here in mid-October, in that particular rate category. Our relationship managers are very much in tune with the rate environment and are prepared to have more discussions with our client base, should rates decrease further. Here's our challenge, we have to reduce deposit rates while at the same, increasing our deposit book to fund loan growth and reduce our dependency on the more expensive wholesale funding. Our ability to accomplish this rests primarily with our new hires that continue to grow their deposits from their client base. More on deposit rates. We don't normally provide monthly information during our quarterly conference calls, but I wanted to emphasize the positive work our relationship managers were accomplishing with respect to lowering rates on our interest-bearing transaction accounts. Several may believe that this is merely pushing a button in our deposit systems. Granted we have those accounts, those are the rates you'd account on the previous slides that 65% of our interest-bearing transaction accounts are negotiated, which means that the only person that can authorize a change to that rate is the relationship manager. It is part of our brand. All banks have  (00:17:05) accounts and all banks have negotiated rate accounts. We believe our approach is much different and much more intentional. It's really at the core of relationship banking, the bank's treasury, namely me and a few other number-crunchers who would love to call up – call the  (00:17:20) and tell them to lower rates, and the deed will be done. At Pinnacle, these bean counter types have to be able to convince their relationship manager, or better said, their supervisors, by call – to call their client to lower their rate and it's not only a good idea, but a fair idea. So far, so good. Can't tell you where we think we'll be at the end of October, but we're optimistic that we will experience continued progress on reducing rates on our interest-bearing transaction accounts. Our goal is a 50% beta for our interest-bearing deposit book, so we got ways to go to achieve our targets but we are off to a great start. It will take us a while on CDs. Our CD book is split about 60% customer and 40% wholesale. The wholesale CDs were rolled down fairly quickly giving us an average duration of slightly more than six months. While the customer book will take a little longer as its average duration is approximately 10 months. When rates were rising, we took our fair share of criticism regarding increasing our deposit rates. As we enter the front part of what could be an extended down rate cycle, we like our odds. We will be proactive with our clients and not have the hands in the curtain to surprise them. We sincerely appreciate our client list and we will leverage the depth of our relationships to accomplish our objectives. With the inverted yield curve in place now for several months, speculation of our credit cycle change due to recession occurring has been on investors' minds for quite some time. We believe we've got the best relationship bankers in the business. We also believe we have the best credit officers. This is not their first rodeo. They can sense when storm clouds are beginning to form. Right now, as far as credit risk is concerned, based on our credit metrics and what Harvey White and his team tell me,  clouds (00:19:11) remain pretty darn good. We've shown these charts before. The chart provides us even more comfort that we're not looking at very large commercial real estate projects. Credit remains in the forefront of our minds, so I hope we never appear complacent when we talk about credit. For the third quarter, we experienced relatively smaller increase on our net charge-off ratio, while nonperforming asset and classified asset ratios decreased, so we believe that as the credit in the third quarter will be steady as she goes agreeing with other bankers that we're not seeing any systemic issues that will cause us to change our perspectives about credit in 2019 or in the 2020. Now, concerning CECL, how much will our allowance increase? We're in the final stages of validating the various models we will use to determine the allowance account each quarter. Preliminarily, we believe that the allowance account could be in a range of 70 basis points to 80 basis points, up from the 48 current. This amount includes a meaningful amount of purchased credit impaired reserves which we'll transfer from loan account into the allowance account without an impact to capital. At September 30, that amount was about – was slightly over $6 million which approximates to 3 basis points for the loan portfolio. Now turning to fees, fees totaled more than $82.6 million, up more than 60% over the third quarter of 2018. As Terry mentioned, BHG had another phenomenal quarter. Their contribution was up $18 million or greater than 126% year-over-year. More on BHG in a second. Our fee businesses are having a strong 2019 with residential mortgages leading the way up approximately 80% annualized this year over last year. They've had a great first nine months of 2019, correlating not only with drops in long-term rates but also with increases in the number of mortgage originators. Also again, great markets are helpful with this line of business, so we anticipate mortgage to finish this year strong. Additionally, deposit, fees and wealth management are having mid-double digit growth years which we consider to be excellent. Concerning the BHG, during the third quarter, we participated in BHG's Analyst Day in New York with several members of their executive team on hand to provide more detailed perspective on BHG's business model. We feel that a lot of great information was provided during the session, so we won't go through these here, but if you like to hear what was said, I will direct you to our website, www.pnfp.com where a recording of that will be available for replays for call it another two months. BHG is having a phenomenal year period. Originations are at all-time highs and the business model continues to outperform. That said, BHG will likely begin to keep more of their credit on their balance sheet, thus realizing more interest income rather than realize significantly on gain on sale. They believe the funding which will allow them to warehouse this loan should be in place within the next few weeks. So we expect  derails (00:22:11) from BHG in the fourth quarter will be less than what has been reported in the second and third quarters with it being more consistent with the amounts reported in the first quarter. The green line on the chart on the right details recourse accrual they've reported on their books for substitution prepayment and other losses associated with honoring their substitution costs for banks that have purchased credit from Bankers Healthcare Group. They've been keeping the resource accrual at about 4.5% of total credits outstanding over the last few years. The columns are actual loss rates in relation to the total line of credit outstanding on the books of all the banks doing business with Bankers Healthcare Group. The column include not only the credit loss primarily substitution losses but also the prepayment loss associated with reimbursement of the earlier payoff of these credits. We've had a lot of conversations with BHG about their credit profiles. Their credit models are sophisticated and subject to continual analysis by their analytics group. We believe that their business model is top-shelf in identifying potential clients who have the credit profile to be a good borrower for BHG, whether BHG keeps the loan on its balance sheet or sells loan into its network of community banks. Approximately 67% of Bankers Healthcare Group revenue base has historically been made up of gain on sale revenues. However, BHG also generates interest income from loans that are either held on BHG's balance sheet permanently or being held on their balance sheet prior to being released at auction platform. Since the second half of 2018, BHG has been building their balance sheet with on-balance sheet loans, approximately $307 million of loans currently held on balance sheet compared to $146 million as of the end of September 2018. They've been able to generate the operating cash required to be able to fund this loan growth. The green bars on the left chart represent originations and ramped up with more loans being funded, which is the result of enhanced analytics and more sophisticated marketing platforms. The blue bars are the loans on which gain on sale has been reported as these loans are placed with bankers with gain on sale revenues being generated. The blue bars have ramped up with more placements either through auction or one-off sales. The gold bars represent the loans held by BHG on its balance sheet, which BHG will collect interest income. As we've mentioned on the previous slide, BHG has anticipated increasing their balance sheet loans. We're all in agreement that by balance sheeting loans, this will provide a more reliable income stream for BHG in the future through a more diverse business model. It will take many quarters for BHG to max the gain on sale revenue with interest income, with that said, we all believe it's a good idea. As to credit risk, given BHG has been honoring the substitution clause for sub loans, any incremental credit risk associated with keeping more loans on its balance sheet should be minimal. Even with all this change, we still believe that BHG should see 10% growth in earnings in 2020 from what they anticipate realizing in 2019. So, now, briefly to expenses, no significant run rate matters to discuss  over on it since (00:25:17). As we mentioned in the press release, we increased our incentive accrual in the third quarter but don't expect our fourth quarter accrual to be nearly as large. We're also pleased to report that retention rates continue to increase signaling two important things for us: our clients can count on consistent services and employee turnover continues to shrink, and our workforce engagement initiatives are taking hold in our newer markets as those associates are buying into our culture. For the last two years our expense to average asset ratio, excluding merger expenses, had been in the 1.9% range. We don't see that changing materially as we head into 2020. Lastly, yesterday, our board of directors approved an additional $100 million share repurchase authorization for open market purchases of our common stock. This authorization extends through December 2020 and begins upon the exhaustion of our current authorization which has approximately $30 million of remaining funds available for common stock repurchases. We intend to use every bit of this authorization but we will do it rationally over the next 15 months. With that, I will turn it back over to Terry. Thanks, Harold. As Harold discussed on our last quarter call, we modified our longer term operating ranges. Our previous metrics was put in place in 2012 and we believe the granularity that were provided by those previous measurements were important at that time and has served its purpose. But now we're opting to go with a higher level of guidance with operating ranges for ROAA, ROTCE and tangible equity as our current guidepost. For ROAA, we're targeting a 1.45% to 1.65% range. As you can see, for the third quarter, we're operating high in that range at 1.62%. We've also introduced ROTCE and tangible equity ratio, these two new measures that we'll continue to highlight for you going forward. And you can see we're in the range on ROTCE and it's at higher levels with the tangible equity ratio. Our goal is to maintain these ratios in the top quartile of our peer group over time. And finally, we  count this chart for (00:27:31) we continue to believe that we're a top quartile grower of EPS and tangible book value within our peer group. We're laser-focused on rapid, reliable growth in EPS and tangible book value. Our tangible book value was up by more than $5 a share in the last year, or slightly over 20%. And as you know, our incentive systems are designed to take every person and focus them tightly on EPS growth. As I've mentioned a number of times before, our belief is banks that can rapidly and reliably grow EPS and tangible book value over time will produce the best shareholder returns. As you can see on this chart, growth here has been both rapid and reliable. The slide that you're looking at here is the same slide that I used to close the quarterly earnings call in January and used it to try to set expectations for 2019. In the third quarter, I think we hit the bull's-eye. To the first bullet point, we had a 14.5% linked-quarter annualized rate of growth for core deposits and took our cost of deposits down 11 basis points during the quarter. To the second bullet point, we had an 11.3% linked-quarter annualized rate of growth for loans. To the third bullet point, we had a year-over-year growth rate for adjusted EPS of 19.8%. To the fourth bullet point, we've exceeded our aggressive hiring plan on C&I and private bankers in conjunction with BNC merger. We've also had several success across the entire footprint and considering all types of revenue producers, including not only the relationship managers, but other revenue producers like brokers, mortgage originators, insurance agents and so forth. We've hired 67 year-to-date while not damaging the EPS growth rate or the efficiency ratio. That speaks to the fifth bullet point as well. And to the last bullet point, we continue to grow tangible book value up 20.6% year-over-year. So, Joelle, we'll stop there and take questions. Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions.  Your first question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, Jared. Hey, Jared. Just maybe if I could start with on the deposit side, another quarter where you're able to see deposit growth outpaced the loan growth. Do you think that we've turned the corner now? And if we look at whether it's year-over-year average deposit growth or quarterly deposit growth outpacing growth, should we expect to start to see that loan-to-deposit ratio come down and do you – you feel like you've gotten sort of permanent traction there or is there still going to be some more quarterly fluctuation? Yeah. I don't think we'll see the loan-to-deposit ratio go down. We should expect to see deposit growth through natural swell in the fourth quarter. I know I've got something like – we're talking about on the call, I've got that one large depositor whose balances will come down some in the fourth quarter. He's transferring much of that deposit into our wealth management unit. So, we'll have those kind of fluctuations. But as far as will we see deposits outstrip loans in the fourth quarter, I can't really speak to that. I think we've got a lot of energy around deposit growth. I think our folks were focused on it. So, we anticipate fourth quarter having a swell though. Okay. And then on BHG that's great color, and I mean obviously it was good color on the Investor Day as well. Can you remind us as we look into 2020 with portfolio more on the balance sheet, I guess, a couple of questions; one, where do you think that reserve – and I know they don't necessarily call it the reserve but their recourse accrual. Where does that ultimately go as they build out that balance sheet as they say in that 4.5% range or what, should we expect to see that grow? And then where does the revenue split between gain on sale and net interest income sort of flow by the end of 2021, so – also those funding lines are in place? Yeah. I think for gain on sale to match interest income is going to take at least all of 2020 and probably into 2021 before we get to like a 50/50 split that I think I almost talked about on the Analyst Day. As to the recourse accrual – recourse obligation at 4.5%, some of that amount is tied up in prepayment losses. So I doubt with the on-balance sheet numbers you don't necessarily need to create a reserve for prepayments because those revenues haven't been recognized yet. So, they're 4.5%. I don't know for the on-balance sheet loans whether or not they will need to be that elevated. Does that make sense? Yes. Yes. Okay. That sounds good color. Thanks. And then just finally on the – for me on the incentive comp, so are you close to accruing at sort of 100% based on goals or could we continue to see that drift up as we go through the end of the year? Yeah. We're at a 115% of our target at the end of September. We think we've got a good shot at maintaining that number here in the fourth quarter. As far as what the fourth quarter accrual looks like, it'll look a lot like what we accrued in the second quarter going into the fourth quarter, we believe right now. Okay great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Thank you. And your next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Jennifer. Hi. A couple of questions. Harold, you had a pretty steep increase in other fee income from second quarter, third quarter. Anything unusual in there? And is that a good run rate going forward, or is it more like second quarter? I think it'll be a decent run rate going forward. We have some swap revenues that we booked this quarter over the second quarter. So, I'm not anticipating a big drop going into the fourth quarter. Okay. And Terry, could you talk about the rationale for acquiring Advocate Capital, and what you like about the business model, and your interest in other types of specialty lending company. Thanks. Yeah. So, Advocate Capital is a targeted financier for finance attorneys. It is a great business and great business model. You could see they originate high-quality loans at higher yields. Not dissimilar to the way BHG does it. It's a value-added approach. In their case, the value add is that they provide accounting software that enables finance attorneys to recapture the interest expense and in the settlement proceeds. And so that's the thing that requires specialized accounting mechanism to get done. That's the value that they add. And so as a result of doing that, they're able to capture the financing specifically for cases, however, they have blanket liens on all receivables of the firm. So, again it's a value-added approach to produce a higher yield from a high-quality borrower. As you know, we like those kinds of businesses. The appeal is that it's a business we understand, we know how to underwrite those loans not that we're the experts, they are. But again, it's just a business that we understand and our approach is always to make sure you get some value add, not to compete on price. And so that's what this business does. I think part of the honey for us on this transaction is they've only been providing lending products but we believe that we can perhaps enhance some of their lending products. But more important that we sell the full suite of treasury services and we've gotten issues underway right now to initiate gathering deposits through  that client set (00:36:59). So, on a standalone basis, we feel like it's a handsome transaction, and then when you add revenue synergies that we believe we'll get out out of it, it's a very handsome transaction. Will the leadership team stay in place there, Terry, and are they locked up for a certain period of time? Yes. The leadership team does stay in place and they are locked up – Harold, I believe, for three years? Three years, Jennifer. Thank you very much. Welcome. Thank you. Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Hey. Good morning, guys. Hey, Steve. Nice quarter. Nice quarter, as usual, it seems. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of growth trends in your markets. I know to hit your targets, you don't really depend on the underlying growth of the markets; you depend more on your hiring activities. But I'm curious kind of how that dynamic will play out in terms of if you're expecting to see your – or are seeing still overall market growth or more of your growth is truly dependent today on the new hires. Yeah. Steve, let me make sure I'm clear. I don't have detailed information here where I can say, okay, here's the percentages, how it breaks down, and so forth. But I don't mind to give you what my gut feel is for how that works. I think over time always the biggest portion of our loan and deposit generation is a function of market share takeaway. And so, that is tied to higher-grade bankers having to move their books of business, as you know that our belief is that it takes probably four years' time on average for them to consolidate that book of business. And so, again the people that have been hired, say, over last four years are still in the process of consolidating their books, taking market share, and that would be the biggest part of the growth both of loan and deposit by far. I think if you're looking for what is just the market condition, I think our relationship managers would say that just the volume growth is probably slower today than it would have been several quarters ago. I don't think it's dramatically slower, but I think it would be modestly slower than three quarters ago, just in terms of pure economic loan growth – pure economic demand. Okay. Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks. And then, maybe Harold, if we're looking at the core NIM, it looks like that was helped slightly, obviously, by Advocate Capital but may have been down maybe in the 10-basis-point sort of range ex that. And with the detail you gave in the slide deck around new loan yields, it looks like those were pressured down maybe 35 basis points or so quarter-over-quarter on new yields. So, how much downside, I guess, do you think we have from here in that core NIM based on what you're seeing on new loan yields and continued expectations for Fed cuts? Yeah. Assuming – we've got one Fed cut built in our model for December. We believe that our margin – the GAAP margin is pretty close to being stabilized. There is probably some more dilution to go here in the fourth quarter but I think bond yields will stabilize. If we get two more rate cuts next year, then, we'll probably have some lags, but we think that we'll be able to drag these deposits down to help offset that. So, assume one rate cut in December, we've probably got anywhere from, call it, 10 to 15 basis points of NIM contraction at a GAAP level. And with that, our purchase accounting will obviously be less impacted. Okay. And are you – I know you've got that $38 million estimate for 2019 accretion. Are you discussing at all yet what you expect to see in 2020 from an accretion standpoint? We haven't gotten that yet, it'll probably be coming out pretty quickly. We went from $64 million down to $39 million, so there will another probably meaningful drop, you can kind of guess where that might hit. Okay. And one last clarifying question if I could. On the expense run rate, I mean, you were more like a $133 million or so this quarter. If we took out the 7.5% of where you think the accrual rate will revert back to 2Q levels. Is it fair to assume you think expenses will be in that kind of mid to high $120 million level in 4Q? Yeah I think that's a fair number. Great. Well, thanks for the time guys, appreciate it. Thank you. Your next question comes from Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey, Brett. Hi, Brett. Wanted to go back to deposits and just talk about the piece of lowering the deposit costs and – I know the CD book, part of its wholesale. Can you just talk about with the pace in the fourth quarter, be 5 or 6 basis points on interest-bearing cost basis. And then, possibly higher as we go into the first quarter. Can you just give us an idea of the magnitude as you roll the CD book and grow the core deposits as well kind of what you're expecting on that? Yeah, I think we should realize a meaningful decrease in average deposit rates going into the fourth quarter – or for the fourth quarter. We were at 1.25% in the third quarter an average deposit rates. We probably will be maybe as much as, call it, 10 to 12 basis points for that for the fourth quarter. And then, that will extend into the first quarter of next year. So, we're thinking we've got anywhere from 15 to 25 basis points of deposit cost reduction here over the next, call it, six months. Okay. That's good color. And then the other question I had was just, Terry, you talked early in the call about the sloppy environment. I'm just curious if there are things that you're straying away from or you think is risk in the environment. And as we think about 2020 in particular, do we see balanced growth in CRE and C&I or can you give us maybe color on what – some color on what you're more emphasizing given the current environment? Yeah. I think, I would say that if you just – if you were at the Monday morning meetings where we meet with all our sales force, the messages that you would hear would primarily be around deposit acquisition and lowering the cost of funds on the existing book. So, that's where most of the energy and emphasis is. When you think about the credit risk and so forth in there, I think we communicated in the past the broad areas of concerns which would be hospitality in particular and, to a lesser extent, multifamily and urban core. But again, we don't have a hard stop on anything with the exception of hospitality. And that, I would say, is primarily just because we've got all of that we want, it's not because we think the credits were necessarily difficult, but just from a portfolio management standpoint, we are at or above our concentration guidelines. So, that's the only thing that's got a hard stop on it. Again, I think, if you – just to maybe help you with some insight for us, just go back to the way we grow our loan book is to hire people, and so people are moving their books, and that's where loan growth comes from. And so it's – there certainly are times when we're saying, okay, we'll not take any more of this asset class or that asset class, but it's really more driven by the books, that the various relationship managers that we hire control. Okay. Appreciate all the color. All right. Thanks, Brett. Thank you. And your next question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Your line is now open. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning. Hey, I wanted to circle back on, I think, Jared's earlier question just around the incentive comp. did you say you're currently accruing at 115% or 150%? 150% or 115%? 115%. Okay. So... We have – Tyler, for just your information, we have a cap at 125%, so we can't go any higher than that. Yeah. Okay. So, I guess, that would put you guys at around kind of a $41 million expense – incentive comp expense at the baseline, and then just trying to think about 2020, what that number could look like, should that kind of grow in the mid-teens kind of range off of a 100% accrual just given the hiring and... Yeah, I think so. Okay. I think your math is good. So that's probably not a bad number. Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the spot deposit cost at the end of the quarter of 1.17%. I'm just wondering, Harold, if you'd be willing to share the spot margin at the end of the quarter, at 09/30. Yeah, I wish I could. I don't know – necessarily know if I've got it. I can probably calculate up – calculate a spread, but we still believe going into the fourth quarter, we've got some dilution in the margin coming. So, I'll just leave it at that. Okay. That's fair. Maybe just a minor one within the margin. Just geographically, where are the market-indexed deposits located? My assumption was that it was all in the CDs for some reason, but I'm just curious if you could share where those are – or just across the deposit product types, where those are at? Yeah. I think they're all over the place. I think they're in interest-bearing checking accounts, I think they're in money market accounts. I don't think there's – they're not – they're to larger depositors, by and large, I am not saying there's not some smaller depositors in there, but they're primarily to bigger – to the larger depositors. Okay. Thanks. And just lastly, just given the transition of BHG over the next several quarters from the gain on sale to the balance sheet. Do you think you can maintain your profitability targets within that range over the near term as you kind of digest that transition at BHG? Say that one more time, Tyler. So, I'm just wondering with the transition of BHG and the revenue outlook you gave there with the step down coming in the fourth quarter, and then the year-over-year 10% growth, 2020 versus 2019, I'm just wondering if you can still maintain the ROA and ROE within the range that you've given just over the near term as you digest that transition. Yeah. I've not run those calculations for them specifically, but it seems like the profitability metrics will be more difficult given the size of the balance sheet. The ROE numbers probably not so much, they'll probably be fairly consistent. But with the ROA numbers, I'm not sure. Okay. All right. Thanks, Harold. Thank you. And your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hey, guys, this is Anthony Elian on for Steve. Hey, Anthony. Hey, Tony. Hello. So, just a follow-up for me on  (00:49:25). So appreciate the color you provided for the allowance account on a go-forward basis. Have you calculated what your estimate is for the day one impact to your reserve levels? Yeah. I think the day one impact will be that, call it, into that 70 to 80 basis point threshold. So, we'll probably be somewhere close to where we are at the end of the third quarter as of the end of the fourth quarter barring any unforeseen challenges the fourth quarter presents. But it's looking like that day one adjustment will be the delta between the 48 basis points that we're at and, call it, 70 to 80 basis points we'll be in, yeah. Got it. Yeah, after tax. After tax, yeah. And next for me on expenses. So, came in a little bit high because of the incentives this quarter. Would you still expect to improve the efficiency ratio for full year 2019 versus 2018 inclusive of the incentives in the third quarter? Yeah, give me a second. I think you – there are probably – what we're looking at now going into 2020 is we don't plan for an outsized incentive accrual. So, we'll have that savings in the plant we're looking at. We still think we've got some operating leverage to create a lower efficiency ratio. But it won't – I don't think it'll be meaningful. I don't think it'll be a head-turner. I'll just probably put it like that. Got it. And finally for me, your expectation for GAAP NIM to decline 10 basis points to 15 basis points for the December rate cut. Is that a decline for the fourth quarter specifically or is that the full impact from the December rate cut, so, sometime in early 2020? That would be for the December rate cut in the fourth quarter. I don't – we're not planning on absent any rate cuts in 2020, and we've just not done sensitivity analysis around additional rate cuts in 2020. But going into that once – we think the fourth quarter will be fairly close to the bottom on our margin – on our GAAP margin. If we get more rate cuts in 2020, which is I'm not naïve, I think there's strong likelihood to that. Then we'll have to go through and recap where we think our margins will go with those. We just haven't gone through that sensitivity analysis or we have I'm just not ready to talk about it too much right now. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Stuart Lotz with KBW. Your line is now open. Hey, guys, good morning. How's it going? Hey, Stuart. Most of my questions have been answered already, but I guess just one follow-up on the expenses. I appreciate the color on the incentive comp and kind of where you see that run rate going forward. But just looking at this quarter, occupancy expenses were down about $3.5 million. Anything onetime in there and is that kind of the run rate we can expect going into 4Q? Now, we had the write-off in the second quarter of those – we had some branch assets, some other assets that we charged off in the second quarter, so that was primarily the reason for the reduction. Okay. Got it. Appreciate the color. And then, just one in terms of capital, now with the increased buyback authorization, you got $30 million left before yearend, do you expect to eat through that before we get to the $100 million in 2020? And in terms of, do you have a plan in place? Is that kind of – how should we kind of model that utilizing that buyback for 2020? Yeah. I think you should probably, and not to be curt, just assume that we've got $130 million left and I've got five quarters to spend it, and I fully intend to spend it. So, that $30 million, does that expire at yearend? The $30 million expires in the first quarter of next year. Okay. Well, the share price will dictate a lot of that. Yeah. And a lot of people ask these questions about what those share prices might be for us to do the buyback. And to be honest with you, we'll – I think the overriding statement here is that we're going to spend the money. Got it. I will take that  (00:54:45). All right. That's it for me. Thanks for the color. All right. Thank you. And your final question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Hey guys. Hi Brian. Hey Harold. Just a few clarifying points. The comment on BHG with their step-down in 4Q to a more normalized level. If you go back to your first quarter level and you're kind of in the low-90%-s, your expectation when you were talking earlier is that we have looked at that full-year number and 10%-plus growth in 2020 is how to think about BHG even with this transition in the model. Is that correct? I think so. I think that's right. Okay. I just want to make sure I heard what you said. And then just as it relates, I think you made comments about the GAAP margin. And given that accretion was a little bit higher this quarter, when you look at fourth quarter and the core margin in your impact, I guess how you think about the core margin which was what, maybe kind of the mid-320s this quarter, how do you see the core margin in the fourth quarter playing out with the rate cuts and in your outlook for one more in December? Well, if I get – if I get 10 basis points to 15 basis points in contraction in my GAAP margin, just call it as we sit here today, that – the core margin shouldn't contract that much because we're not anticipating as large of a purchase accounting hit to our contribution in the fourth quarter. We were at $11 million here in the third quarter. We were at $8 million in the second quarter. So, we just – we think the fourth quarter is going to be less than $8 million. Okay. And from an accretion standpoint? Right. I got you. Okay. And the impact from each – when you guys look at it today based on what you've seen with your relationship managers, I mean, your expectation, Harold, from a – for each 25-basis point rate cut, I guess what do you see as the impact to the margin as you look forward, I guess, if we look to 2020 and potentially seeing more rate decreases out there? Yeah. I think as we see more rate decreases out there, we will get closer to what we were doing back, call it two years ago. We'll find our way back to deposit rates that were significantly lower than where they are today. I've got you. Okay. And then just your last comment or your earlier comment about the efficiency ratio. I guess I just want to make sure that as you're talking about 2020 versus 2019 as far as kind of maybe holding its own or staying flattish... That's right. Full year to full year. Right? Okay. All right. And then, just a final thing for me was just on M&A. I guess, you guys have talked about this in the past, Terry, you've outlined it. Any changes in kind of what you're seeing on the M&A front today or following the addition of Advocate here any other non-bank things you're looking at, or is it more bank specific today? I would say, so let me just sort of recap what I think – what I hope we've said before or I think as what Rick or Joe, which is we sort of communicated to the markets we want to be and we've communicated kind of what our M&A criteria are. We have said they are not very many deals that would meet that threshold. And so, as we – and I think that's particularly exacerbated by relatively low share prices. Our currency is not as strong as it has been and other periods of acquisition. We've said we'll go to these expanded markets, which have changed, based on our acquisition around de novo basis. And I think we've said on the de novo basis is probably have more people today than in any time in our history. But call it, it's just a tremendous volume of people and talent that are in play. And so that's sort of what we think about bank M&A I wouldn't just get your heart stop. No never. But again, I just think the level of expansion might be the best route for our company to take. I think in terms of non-bank deals to be very honest with you those are a little more opportunistic. Again, in the case of Advocate Capital that's a company that we now own over a very long period of time. We participated in their credit over an extended period of time. And so, again, when we could find companies that have some value add in terms of financial services to clients, those are the ones  that have appealed on us (00:59:53). And again, with an emphasis on their ability to grow at a rate commensurate with ours. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it, Terry. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Your next question is a follow-up question from Stuart Lotz of KBW. Your line is now open. I'm actually good. Sorry about that, I guess. All right. Thanks, Stuart. Thank you. And your next question is a follow-up question from Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Your line is now open. Hey, sorry about this guys. Thanks for taking the follow up. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that the cadence of the margin expectations and Harold, I'm not trying to pin you down, but just, I guess, thinking about it out loud. So, the margins should have – be lower following the September cut. Then you've got the 10 basis points to 15 basis points hit from the December cut that you kind of expected to see, and then there's some accretion headwinds in 2020. I'm just trying to put that to the expectation that the margin should bottom in in the fourth quarter. Can you just – am I understanding that correctly? Can you walk through just the cadence of that? Yeah. I think that's right. I think we believe right now, barring any additional rate cuts in 2020, we think the margin will kind of flatten out in the fourth quarter, that's going to be – we're going to have to get serious on – more serious on deposit cost reduction. So I think we can do that. And we think our fixed rate loans will likely not see further call it reduction in their loan yields. So, right now, that's our call – that's our model. Okay. The 10 basis points to 15 basis points, that is from the December cut. Is that right? In terms of just what you're assuming internally? So, I think most of the 10 basis points to 15 basis points is going to come from the September cut, and we think we'll be able to cover a lot of the rate cuts from December going into 2020. Got it. Okay. That clears it up. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Q3 2019 Earnings Call",
         "Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review on the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.  This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12:30 PM Eastern through Wednesday, October 23, at 12 midnight Eastern Standard Time. I will now turn the conference over to Jean Thompson (sic) [Jen Thompson], Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. You may begin. Thank you, Polly, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Thanks, Jen. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions. I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter we earned $1.15 per share. Despite a more challenging interest rate environment, we reported record levels of revenue and net income driven by healthy loan and deposit growth and continued momentum across our key businesses. Credit quality remains stable. Turning to capital management, our book value per share increased 10.6% from a year ago, and during the quarter we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the third quarter we delivered a return on average common equity of 15.3% and a return on average assets of 1.57%. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.4%. Positive operating leverage drove improvement in our efficiency ratio on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 5, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. As expected, average loans grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 4.7% year-over-year excluding the fourth quarter 2018 sale of FDIC covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. Strong residential mortgage and credit card loan growth supported both linked quarter and year-over-year performance. Commercial and industrial loans grew 0.4% sequentially and 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. Paydown activity picked up in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital market conditions. New business activity remains healthy although paydown activity is likely to continue at elevated levels near-term. Commercial real estate loans decreased on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This quarter, commercial real estate contributed a 33-basis point drag to linked quarter average loan growth and an 89-basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. Turning to slide 6, deposits increased 1.4% on a linked quarter basis and grew 6.0% year-over-year. Compared with the prior period, we continued to see migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. That migration along with deposit growth momentum in both our Wealth Management and Corporate and Personal Banking divisions helped drive average savings deposits up 8.4% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 7, credit quality remains stable. On a dollar basis, non-performing assets increased 2.7% versus the second quarter and decreased by 2.5% compared with a year ago. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned was stable at 33 basis points compared with the second quarter and modestly improved versus 36 basis points a year ago. Slide 8 highlights third quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $1.15 compared with $1.06 a year ago. Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 0.5% compared with the second quarter and increased by 0.8% year-over-year, which is in line with our expectations. Both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from healthy loan growth offset by the impact of declining rates and a flatter yield curve. Our net interest margin declined by 11 basis points versus the second quarter, in line with our expectations. About 4 basis points of the decline was due to higher cash balances, primarily reflecting changes in policies related to deposits by the European Central Bank. Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. Middle single-digit year-over-year growth in each of the three payment fee lines, credit and debit card, corporate payments products, and merchant processing, was driven by higher sales volumes. As a reminder, processing day count will end up affecting year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth comparisons in several quarters in 2019. In the third quarter, three additional processing days versus a year ago benefited revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, two fewer days will be a drag on year-over-year growth. We continue to expect low single-digit growth of credit and debit card fee revenue for the full year. Commercial product revenue increased 11.1% from a year ago, primarily due to higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue related to strong capital markets activity. Mortgage banking revenue increased 56.3% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 40.3% and mortgage application volume increased by 53.1%. Refinancing activity represented about 40% of production in the third quarter of 2019 compared to about 30% in the linked quarter. Refinancings represented 51% of applications in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in deposit service charges reflected the impact of the sale of our third party ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in other revenue was partly driven by the inclusion of the related transition services revenue which will decrease over time as well as higher equity investment income and a gain on sale of assets. Turning to slide 11, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected higher personnel costs, partly due to higher variable compensation related to business production within mortgage banking and the capital markets business line as well as increased medical costs. Professional services expense increased primarily due to business investment and enhancement in risk management programs, while higher technology expense growth was primarily tied to business growth initiatives. The decrease in other expense primarily reflected lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects and lower FDIC assessment costs. Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.6%; this compares to our target of 8.5%. As previously discussed, our goal has been to manage the capital level closer to our target once we had clarity related to adopting CECL and the final capital rules were promulgated by the Federal Reserve. With the recent release of the final rules, we plan to make a request to the Federal Reserve to increase our share repurchase program to enable us to begin reducing our common equity Tier 1 ratio from 9.6% to approximately 9.0%. I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the fourth quarter we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect mid-single-digit fee income growth on a core basis year-over-year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2019 on a core basis, in line with our previous guidance. We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the fourth quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the third quarter. Loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Thanks, Terry. The record results and industry-leading returns that we delivered in the third quarter despite a more challenging interest rate environment is a testament to our well-balanced business model, our numerous competitive advantages, and our risk management discipline. As we head into the final quarter of 2019, we feel good about our loan and deposit trends and our ability to continue to gain market share across our franchise. As indicated on slide 13, we are seeing good digital uptake trends. As loans are increasingly sourced through our digital channels, we expect better customer experience, higher account and volume growth, and improved operational efficiency. Our core fee businesses are performing well. Investments made over the past few years in our payments and mortgage business lines are delivering anticipated results in the form of improving sales and volume growth. Our scale and differentiated service model is helping us win new business and expand existing relationships in our trust and investment services business which is driving strong asset under management and fee growth. Importantly, we are deepening relationships across our entire franchise as we bring the power of one U.S. Bank to each of our business customers and consumers. Credit quality remains stable and we are not seeing any early indicators in our portfolio that causes concern. However, we are mindful that at some point the industry will experience a credit downturn, and we remain disciplined in terms of origination quality, and our long-term strategy remaining within our defined credit box regardless of the competitive environment. In closing, I'd like to reiterate the message I delivered at our recent Investor Day. We are in a position of strength and we'll continue to leverage the core competencies and competitive advantages that got us to where we are today. However, the world is changing rapidly and we are adjusting and investing for the future so that we can continue to deliver the industry-leading growth and returns our shareholders have come to expect from us. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment they bring to the job every day. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator? And your first question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Matt. [Technical Difficulty] (00:12:36-00:12:52) Okay. And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, John. Good morning, John. Hi. Terry, was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the request for the capital increase. Just over what timeframe you might be looking to do the 9.6% down to 9%? Is that over the course of a year or a couple months or – and again, what gave you the – what was the clarity you're looking for? Was it CECL and the tailoring I think you mentioned? Yeah. Well, with respect to the second part, I think that we've now been through parallel runs for a couple different quarters and the outlook from an economic standpoint is still relatively solid, and so I think we feel comfortable that we have a good range and it's consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day, and then obviously the final rules coming out is helpful. From a timing standpoint, it won't be accelerated. I think it'll be bringing that 9.6% down to 9.0% really during the 2019 CCAR cycle, so by the end of the second quarter. Okay, got it. So it is, for this cycle, to do it by the second quarter of next year? Yes, yes. Okay, got it. And then wanted to ask you guys just more broadly about your outlook just in terms of kind of generating positive operating leverage in what's proving to be a difficult – more difficult rate environment. As you turn the corner into 2020 is that a goal and is that 100 basis points kind of a bogey still? And Terry, you had mentioned at Investor Day that 2020 was a tougher year when you're talking about your three-year targets. Yeah. And then – and maybe also Terry, if you could just kind of clarify. I think at Investor Day you said part of that outlook is you thought your net interest income might grow faster than your fees, and maybe if you could just give a little follow up color on that. Yeah, so a lot of different questions there. I mean, certainly in terms of positive operating leverage, it's a balancing act between short and long-term and we always kind of take that into consideration. 2020, as I said at Investor Day I think is going to be a challenging year because of where interest rates are today versus where they were a year ago. I mean, the long end of the curve 10 years I think down 150, almost 150 basis points from where it was last year so the landscape certainly has changed relative to when that guidance came out. Right now, I think our outlook with respect to positive operating leverage is to achieve that in 2019 on a core basis. And as we kind of think about different initiatives, the second thing we will take into consideration is the fact that our – we continue to transform from a digital perspective. Derek talked about kind of a do-it-yourself sort of a focus, so I think we're going to end up looking at a lot of different things that we can do in order to try to manage expenses as prudently as we can. But I think a part of it is just what happens with interest rates, I mean, as it's so volatile right now it's hard to really know and having an outlook that's much beyond a quarter is pretty tough. Coming back to net interest income versus fees, that guidance or those comments were really focused around what we think between now and three years out where that growth is going to come from, and I think part of that is an assumption that once we get beyond 2020 the interest rate environment starts to normalize and either stabilizes or starts to come up. And so I think that's the part of the thought process between where that mix is going to come from. And I just reiterate, John, that the theme that we talked about – this is Andy – talked about at Investor Day continues to hold which is delivering in the short-term while investing for the long-term. So we're going to manage short-term performance, understanding the rate environment and the economic environment but deliver on what we talked about in terms of positive operating leverage but at the same time investing for the long-term growth that we're seeking. Got it. Thank you. Sure, John. Yes. And your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Good morning, Betsy. Hey, good morning. Hey, Betsy. Hi. One follow up there on the tailoring rule. There's also a benefit I think to the LCR and how you report, calculate that, and carry cash around that. And I'm wondering does that have any impact on how you think about either the portfolio that you're holding or your ability to be more competitive for loans because you can value non-operating deposits or any other benefit from that that maybe we could get a little under the hood on? Yeah. So with the rules related to LCR coming out, it was essentially kind of reducing it to the 85% level. And as we talked, that really helps free up liquidity probably in the range of $11 billion to $15 billion, kind of in that ballpark. And we're still formulating kind of what our game plan is, but I think that we'll look at kind of remixing the investment portfolio in order to be able to both extend duration and possibly enhance the yield a little bit. We may look at reducing our debt level in the wholesale market, and I think that a number of those different actions would be beneficial to the company. And it's going to be basis points; it's not going to be a major change I think in terms of net interest income just based upon kind of where the yield curve is, etcetera. But we're looking at all sorts of things. Right, and I get that. Every little bit helps though just because... Yes, it sure does. Yes, sure does. And does it impact at all the competitiveness with regard to commercial lending or not really? I don't think so. Okay. I mean, we end up driving from a competitive standpoint based upon what the pricing is in the marketplace and I just don't see it impacting that a lot. Okay. And given our debt rating and our low cost of funds, we're already in a pretty good position regarding loan pricing. Got it. Okay. And then, Andy, just separately, at Investor Day really interesting kind of sidebar tech showcase that you had, and I want to just understand how you're thinking about the offering that you've got for merchant acquiring merchant services and understand where you think there's more that you can do there to expand your offering either to other verticals, take what you've got in your restaurant, hospitality, etcetera, to other verticals or if there's more that you can do with adjacencies on some of the things that you've been adding to over the past year or so. Yeah. I think it's a three-pronged strategy. One is a continued focus on e-commerce and ISVs which we've made great progress in over the last year and we'll continue to focus on it going forward. Secondly is the focus on certain verticals; you named a couple, airlines, hotels, industry, healthcare. And thirdly and importantly and probably the biggest opportunity is this combination of banking products and services together with merchant products and services. The fact is all of our merchants need a bank, many of our small business customers need a merchant provider, and our ability to weave and put those products together in a comprehensive set that helps the customers run their business and give them information I think is the key to our focus and one of the areas I think where we see the most potential. And is it primarily US or is it also Europe? I know you have a more global footprint in this business. Yeah. So the first two would be global across the board. That combination of banking and merchant processing would be principally in the US. Okay. Thanks. You bet. And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Good morning, Ken. Hey, Ken. Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Just a couple fee follow ups. Obviously mortgage banking was very strong and I'm sure built into your outlook for the fourth quarter growth. But can you just talk about how much more pipeline you expect to pull through on the mortgage side and what you're just seeing in terms of the gain on sale outlook and the loan officer side of the equation there? Yeah. So if you think about mortgage banking, I mean obviously it was a very strong quarter from refinancings. When we end up thinking about the fourth quarter, it's very dependent upon where long-term rates are. With the rates kind of back or coming up a little bit most recently, it probably will not be as strong but I think it'll still be a good year-over-year story. From a mortgage banking perspective, the application volume is – it was strong in production, it was strong in the third quarter; we continue to see that momentum. The other thing, Ken, is – and we've talked about this – is we've been over time making good investment in mortgage loan officers on the retail side of the equation, enhancing that. The digital platform that we talked about has a very high percentage of application capture and that just helps and it helps because of the speed to market and our ability to be able to service those customers and get the loans booked. We went through the last, what I would say, cycle of refinancing and our processing times were relatively short compared to competitors and certainly what we have experienced in the past and it's all because of those investments. Got it. And a second question, and I know this comes up from time to time, but inside the other you always mentioned that the PE gains are there and we know that the ATM agreement is in there as well. Can you help us just understand magnitude of the PE gains even on a comparison basis, if not the number? And then also just how the ATM services is – how much is that in revenues and expenses today and how does that work going forward? Thanks, Terry. Yeah. So in terms of other revenue, and it is a lumpy category, it ends up going up and down depending upon what's happening within the various categories, it includes a lot of different things and equity investment is just one piece of it. But if we end up looking at the overall increase on a year-over-year basis, I would break it down kind of like this. About half of it is related to the transitional services revenue and about 25% of it is related to equity investment, and then it's kind of a combination of a lot of other things that are kind of driving that. So when we think about it, and because I know this question is out there, when we think about other revenue, and we've talked a little bit about this, over the course of the last eight quarters it has ranged anywhere on a quarterly basis from $160 million to as high as $300 million, and where we end up looking at, kind of what is a core reasonable level, that $200 million range is kind of in that ballpark give or take. It'll be up a little bit some quarters and down a little bit in other quarters, and that's how we kind of think about it. And then could you just – on the expense side of the ATM is that a decent part of the growth on the expense side as well, the services agreement? Yeah. It is – that service agreement was really negotiated in order to be able to cover the cost, and so the cost level associated with making that transition service agreement is fairly similar to the revenue that we're generating. And from a timing standpoint that will start to go away as conversions are taking place between now and the end of 2020. Got it. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Ken. And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Hey, Mike. Hi. I know we just had your Investor Day. You're talking about positive operating leverage driven by the digital transformation, so I guess I have a front office and kind of a back office question. The front office question, I guess you closed, what, like 150 branches in the last year but still had decent deposit growth. So how much growth are you getting through digital channels or some sort of metric that you can give us? And then the harder question, the back office, I mean you're retooling the inside of the company. Can you give us any metrics like data centers, the peak, where you are now, where you expect them to go or what percent of your applications you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else about kind of the internal retooling too? Mike, I'll start and then Terry can add on. So from a sales perspective, as we think about the digital initiatives, the revamping of our app, and the focus on the digital capabilities, it's focused on a couple of areas. One is insights and improving the ability to connect with the customers. But secondly it's also the ability to improve sales activity, and you see some of our loan stats in the deck that we provide as part of the earnings call. Well, I'll tell you that both loan activity from a sales perspective as well as deposit activity is growing quite rapidly, and we will see a continued movement of more sales activity. Transactions is already high as you know digitally but more sales activity to digital channels I think over time which will allow for continued opportunities on the expense side of the equation. And if you think about the back room? Yeah. So, I mean, what is the back room or even within the branches and a big part of the decision around closures related to branches and reinvestment in branches as well is really kind of that intersection of our employees or people with digital and our customers. And you know obviously the customer behaviors are changing. The amount of transaction activity that's happening in the branches is significantly less than where it was, and in fact 80% of it, roughly 70%, 80% of it goes through the digital channel today. So that gives us the opportunity to really reconfigure the branch network both in terms of size and numbers, etcetera, but also to change the focus from a service-oriented type of location to something that's much more either sales and/or advice-focused. And so I think those trends are going to continue; I don't necessarily have specific metrics. On the deposit side, I would say that there's still room and opportunity for the percentage of sales from the deposit perspective to continue to grow. And I think Derek at Investor Day had said when you think about the opportunity from a digital perspective from sales, and we would include deposits in this, is that should get us closer to that 40%, 50% over time but it'll take a while for us to get there because of the customer adoption that has to take place. Okay. And then as far as the back office, do you have any metrics on number of data centers or how many apps you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else just on the inside of the company? We haven't disclosed the number of data centers but I will tell you, Mike, that we continue to migrate activity to the cloud. And Jeff von Gillern spoke a little bit to that in Investor Day, but most of our new activity and development will occur in the cloud which offers a number of advantages both from a capacity as well as a cost standpoint. All right. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Mike. And your next question comes from Scott Seifers with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning, Scott. Hey, Scott. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just Terry, maybe some updated thoughts on the margin given that the noise from some of the transitory stuff in the third quarter should presumably be settling into the fourth quarter. I guess, one, when – and apologies if you said this – but when do you have any additional rate cuts baked into your own outlook there? And then just as we go forward, are we still thinking kind of $40 million to $45 million sort of all else equal impact from each rate cut? Yeah. Well, let me maybe kind of talk a little bit about kind of our guidance, and hopefully these will kind of get to some of your points. So our guidance with respect to low single digits is really kind of looking at the implied market rate in terms of where they're at in the first couple weeks here of October. And kind of implied in that is an assumption that rates are going to decline, and our assumption is that it will be in a 25-basis point cut in both October and in December, and I think there's still questions as to whether December occurs. The long end of the curve, I think we're assuming that it's roughly kind of where it is right now. So that's kind of the assumptions that we're baking into kind of our perspective regarding margin or net interest income. From a margin perspective, it's down about 11 basis points in a linked quarter. There's about 4 basis points that's really related to those cash balances or building the balances. And so when we think about the fourth quarter, we would expect our net interest margin to decline but kind of in the range of that core level which is 7 to 8 basis points. Okay. So 7 to 8 basis points of margin decline in the fourth quarter? In the fourth quarter, yeah. And I think that the other thing is it's kind of interesting. If you think about the third quarter, the third quarter from an average perspective, short-term rates are actually up about 29 basis points, 30 basis points while the long end was down about 100 basis points, a little over 100 basis points. In the fourth quarter that'll be the first quarter on a year-over-year basis when the short end is down, kind of in the range of that 40 to 50 basis points and the long end is down 150 basis points. So in the industry that's why people are looking at it and just we would expect fourth quarter to become more challenging as we go into the quarter and into 2020. Okay. And then so with that just so I understand, with that 7 to 8 basis points, presumably that kind of moderates as we would look at additional rate cuts or is that sort of a new proxy? I just want to make sure I'm sort of understanding that. Yeah. I mean, I would say that given the fact that it is so volatile right now and we don't really know where rates are going I hate to look out beyond the fourth quarter. Okay, fair enough. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thanks, Scott. And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Erika. I wanted to follow up on John's line of questioning. So even outside of mortgage, the fee income trends are quite strong, payments up 5% year-over-year, trust and investment management up 2% year-over-year, And I'm wondering as we tie that back to your long-term revenue targets, is a 5% fee income clip over that three-year period too optimistic or about in line with what you're thinking? I guess the reason I'm focusing on fees is because like you said, Terry, nobody has any idea on what the forward curve is going to look like, right? I mean, the probability of October changed over the past two hours. So I'm trying to think about the contribution of fees and I have a follow up on balance sheet growth. Yeah. Well, maybe just kind of again, and this kind of ties a little bit to Investor Day and some of the guidance associated with that, the outlook for fee income in part will depend upon what happens with rates, I mean the puts and takes with respect to mortgage banking, and so it's all kind of a function in terms of what happens from a rate perspective. But I think we're confident when we think about the investments that we've been making both in the payments space of the business and our corporate trust and some of the digital capabilities, our capital markets business, all of those we feel like we have a position of strength at this particular point in time and that momentum we'll continue to carry. But, I mean, there will be puts and takes. It kind of depends upon what happens in the environment. Consumer spend continues to be strong. We don't see anything in the short-term, but where that ends up turning when get into 2020 is anybody's game. And on the balance sheet growth contribution to those long-term revenue targets, fully acknowledge that 2020 is going to be challenging. If the rate curve doesn't normalize as you think but doesn't necessarily get worse than what's in the current expectation, is there enough opportunity in terms of delivering all of the bank into your current customers with regards to loan growth? In other words, that implies to me that we would need mid single-digit loan growth over that three-year period in order to potentially mitigate some of the net interest margin volatility or lack of help from the yield curve rather. Yeah, maybe a couple things. The targets that we set are kind of based upon where we think the growth rates are going to be as we get into the second and third year. I've tried to be clear that that's not our expectation with respect to 2020 and it's not necessarily a compounded rate over the three years because of the challenges that will happen in 2020. But when you end up – when we think about the balance sheet right now, and again this is all kind of dependent upon what happens in the economy and that's a little bit hard to predict, but consumer spend and consumer confidence continues to be strong, as in business activity continues to be strong. I think it's moderated somewhat because of tariff policy and that sort of thing or trade policy, but generally I think the economy is solid. And when we end up thinking about 2020 from a loan growth perspective, we think that some of the trends that we're seeing this year will continue. And as we talked, third quarter loan growth of about 4.7% on a core basis, we think that's achievable. And I think from U.S. Bank's perspective, we have the lowest cost of funds in the industry and we have some competitive advantages from a pricing perspective that will enable us to be able to achieve those type of things, so I feel reasonably confident. Yeah. And Erika, if you think – if you step back and look at the third quarter, our earning asset growth was just under 5%, our deposit growth year-over-year was just about 6%. So thinking about the balance sheet growing in that mid-single-digit I think is about right. Yeah. Got it. Great. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. And your next question comes from Vivek Junjay (sic) [Vivek Juneja] with JPMorgan. Good morning, Vivek. Hey, Vivek. Good morning. Hi. Sorry, we've been jumping on multiple calls. I'm apologizing if I'm making you repeat something. The other income, did you give any sort of way to think about what's the sort of run rate that seems reasonable? Yeah, we did talk a little bit about that. And maybe just to reiterate, we end up looking at it, Vivek, and when we think about it we end up looking at that level. On a quarterly basis, it's gone anywhere from $160 million to $300 million and that's a function of the lumpiness that exists across a lot of different categories of income within that including equity investments, etcetera. But if I were to – when we think about kind of that core level on a quarterly basis, $200 million plus or minus is kind of where we believe that is a reasonable kind of range. And if you remember in the past, I had said somewhere between $175 million and $225 million, and that's kind of in that ballpark. So when you end up looking at the year-over-year for the third quarter, about half of that growth is related to the transition servicing agreement that's tied to the ATM business, and so that goes away over time during 2020 tied to when those conversions occur. Together with the expense. Together with the expense. And the expense is pretty similar to the increase related to the transition service agreement from a revenue point of view. And then another one which is positive operating leverage. Your previous guidance used to have the 100 to 150 basis points which went to 100 basis points. Are you thinking full year 2019 given everything going on, you've obviously got positives on mortgage banking, other income running higher but then NII softer, is it still closer to 100 basis points or do you think given where rates have gone that's going to be harder to get to? We're consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day, Vivek, which is somewhat below 100 basis points but still positive operating leverage. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Hey, Matt. Welcome back, Matt. Hi. Thanks. Sorry about that before. Just stepping back kind of bigger picture on this whole operating leverage question, you've got the best revenue growth year-to-date I think of the big banks, about 4%. It seemed like the expense growth is also the highest. And I guess I'm just conceptually wondering like is that the cost of doing business, like to get that much revenue growth that's the expense growth that you need or is there still some catching up in terms of infrastructure or some of the stuff that you were working on a few years ago or is there some trying to get ahead of kind of – to help drive revenue growth in the future? And obviously I'm not looking for specific numbers, but just conceptually some people would look at you and say, okay, the revenue growth is really good but the expense growth was a bit higher and it might just cost that much to generate that much revenue growth. So maybe if you could just comment on some of that. So I'll start, Matt, and Terry will add on. So first, from a big picture standpoint three big puts and takes. Number one is we're going to continue to optimize a number of initiatives from an operation standpoint the way we're delivering products and services, the way we're operating in the back room, and all those things will allow for some saves because that's a positive. Secondly, we're going to continue to invest for the long-term in the digital initiatives we talked about at Investor Day. So that's going to cost a bit more; a lot of that's already in the run rate. If you look at the third quarter specifically though, there were a couple of areas of revenue growth, specifically mortgage and capital markets, that have expenses related to commissions associated with them and that was one of the reasons for the little higher expense growth. Yeah. I mean, the thing I would just kind of maybe add to that because we see that in mortgage and we see that in capital markets specifically, but from an optimization standpoint, and we talked about this in Investor Day, very focused on as the customer behaviors are changing making sure that we're staying in lockstep with that, and I think there is both opportunities in front office from a branch perspective and we'll continue to look at that. And as I said, we may accelerate or increase some of the activity associated with that but it's going to be tied to what happens from a customer standpoint. And then as we continue to move to a digital platform, I think there's back office opportunities in terms of optimization. And then the other thing, and this kind of gets back to the digital activities that Andy was talking about, we're making important investments in all of our lines of businesses and we want to and will continue to do that because it's important for us to look both short-term as well as long-term. Okay. That's helpful. I think sometimes we're also focused on the absolute level of operating leverage, and the fact of matter is call it 80 bps of operating leverage with 4% revenue growth is a lot better than 1%-plus operating leverage with 1% revenue growth. It's just the way the math works so okay, appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, no, that's right. And that 0.8% positive operating leverage on an efficiency ratio of 54 is a lot different than 1% on 62. So part of it is the starting point. Thanks, Matt. And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Hey. Good morning guys. So you guys addressed a lot of my questions. I was going to ask you to speak to some of the loan growth trends which pretty pronounced not only in terms of the absolute level balance sheet growth but just the mix with commercial on an end of period basis, commercial growing 3% and consumer 7% even with home equity declining so the core is even faster than that. So I guess a couple parts though. Maybe you can address how much of that growth is related to exogenous factors or is dependent on a strong macro environment continuing and how much of the growth is a function of things you're doing at the company level to deepen relationships, used analytics and whatnot? And I guess the second part of my question though is around CECL and whether – do you guys even – do you guys consider the impact of CECL when addressing this growth because a lot of the growth is occurring in lending segments that are going to be disproportionally impacted by CECL longer-term, longer weighted average lives and higher loss content like cards. And you, I think yourself Terry mentioned at the Investor Day that you'll have a higher ALLL. To maintain that ALLL ratio you have to provision more. But with this mix shift, that ALLL ratio will continue to migrate upwards. And is that something you guys think about or do you guys just say that hey, that's accounting noise and the economics of this lending activity is the same; it doesn't really matter and over the life of the loan the loss is the law. So just kind of whether the CECL impact on your growth is something you guys think about and how we should think about it in terms of modeling it? Yeah. Good question and we kind of talked a little bit about this in the past. When we think about loan growth and where it comes from and kind of our focus within the company, we really think about it more on an economic basis than we do on an accounting because I do think there's a lot of accounting noise that occurs within CCEL for a lot of different reasons. One is that every company is going to have their own forecast with respect to what happens in the economy and all the things that we've talked about. So we really think about it more from an economic standpoint. In terms of loan growth, again this comes back in terms of what we're seeing today and what we see today is that consumer habits continues to be strong and consumer spend is strong, and those things should tend for good growth from a consumer perspective. And even on the business side that, while it may moderate, it's still a very solid business. So some of it is driven by macroeconomic, other especially as we kind of think out on a longer-term basis is driven by initiatives. We started an ABS lending sort of platform a year ago but this focus, and Andy talked about it, we have merchant and the merchant acquiring side of the equation and small businesses, and there is a significant opportunity for us to be able to leverage both of those. So when we think about loan growth, we also think it's tied to some of our initiatives. Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you very much. Thanks. And your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Good morning Gerard. Hey Gerard. Good morning, Gerard. Hey, Gerard. Good morning guys. You guys have been very good at sharing with us the competition in commercial real estate lending and what's going on in the different loan markets. We hear from many of the smaller commercial banks that they're building out their treasury management products. Are you guys seeing any increased competition in that part of the commercial customer base that you deal with that use those products? Sure. I would say it's not any different than we've seen historically. I would say probably the changes occurring in treasury management and you'll continue to see it going forward is the migration and the use cases related to the real-time payment rails that have been developed and the new products and services as a result of that. So I think that is going to continue to be a change. And if you think about our capabilities in treasury management combined with our corporate payments, I think you're going to continue to see those things coming together and changing with these new rails that have been developed. And do you think – speaking of that, Andy, do you think Zelle will play a role on that on a go-forward basis as Zelle goes from a P2P to possibly a B2B? Well Zelle will start to use those new rails as a component of their mechanism for sure; that's one. Number two is I think Zelle has a lot of opportunity to grow in different aspects and there are also use cases, requests for payment and other things that are coming on the Zelle side. So you're going to see changes on the business-to-business side related to the real-time rails. You're going to see continued migration and changes and enhancement on the consumer side related to Zelle. And at some point some of those things, particularly the small business, may come together a little bit. Great. Yeah. And then the other thing, Gerard, I would just say to that. I think the challenge or the competitive landscape is going to be one based upon who is able to make the investments in connecting the rail, real-time rail or Zelle or whatever might be the case to the customer, and that's where our area of focus has really been around the use cases that create a value proposition to the customer and that investment is very important and it's area of focus for us. That's it. Absolutely right. Thank you. Thank you. And then to pivot, you guys have been very conservative in your construction lending. The portfolio is about, what, $10.7 billion down, just under 5% on a year-over-year basis. But there seems to be recently a resurgence in housing. Today the National Association of Home Builders, their market index rose, beating consensus and there seems to be recently some pickup in activity here. Are you guys seeing that in any of your markers and are there opportunities for you to capture some of that growth? Gerard, we have a housing capital group that does focus on home builders and we are seeing good growth there. West Coast and South principally is where our focus area is and that business is doing well and growing. Some of the other aspects of commercial real estate and some of the declines you're seeing are really a function of some of the credit components that we're seeing our competitors move to that we're not comfortable with. So we have some positives but we have some negatives and we're sticking with our core customers and within the credit box that we participate in. Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right. And there are no further audio questions. Are there any closing remarks? Yes. Thank you for listening to our earnings call and please call the Investor Relations department if you have any follow up questions. That concludes our call. And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, and thank you for joining the Bank of America Third Quarter Earnings Announcement. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call may be recorded. I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thanks for joining the call to review our third quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents. They're available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com's website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio, will review more details of the third quarter results. We'll then open up for questions. Please try to limit your questions so that we can get to all the callers. And for more information on the forward-looking comments we may make, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or the SEC filings. With that, take it away, Brian. Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter of 2019 results. These results reflect our success and the US economy continues to grow at around 2% GDP level. In that kind of economy, our job is simple: Drive solid customer activity, manage risks well, manage expenses well all while investing heavily in our competitive advantage. That's what we have been telling you, It's been what we call responsible growth. The investments we are making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach are evident across every line of business results in respect of customer base as you'll see in the materials. Today, we reported $5.8 billion in after-tax net income, and $0.56 per share for the third quarter. Those results include a previously announced $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge. This charge relates to the investment in our merchant – Bank of America merchant services joint venture from 2009 that negatively impacted our EPS by $0.19. That charge, however, positioned us to meaningfully invest and integrate our payments platforms and our commercial side businesses over the next several years. Excluding that charge, third quarter net income was a record $7.5 billion after tax and EPS of $0.75 per share. On this adjusted basis, net income increased 4% from the third quarter of 2018, while earnings per share increased 14%. This reflects an 8% reduction in average diluted shares from third quarter of 2018. Returns after adjusting for the impairment charge were strong. Return on assets, about 123 basis points; return on tangible common equity, 15.6%. So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results to the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity, costs, and operating leverage at an enterprise level. These are the items that we focus on for you that allow us to drive our competitive advantage. But first, some general context around the operating environment. Despite the repeated discussions or the continuing discussions around a potential recession in the United States, I wanted to offer some data from our customer base which represents the activity of a substantial portion of American consumers. Our annual customer outgoing payments on a consumer side of our company are nearly $3 trillion or about, when compared the U.S. economy, about 15%. Consumer payments year to date are up 6% compared to the same period in 2018 through nine months. For the third quarter, that pace was a solid or slightly increased from earlier in the year. This means the U.S. consumer continues to benefit by strong employment prospects. Now, interesting on the commercial side clients, at roughly $325 billion in average U.S. commercial loans outstanding, we do see a lot of client flows as the market leader in the United States. Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of 2018 with good middle market utilization rates. And importantly, our small business segment also grew 6%. As such, we are the largest U.S. commercial lender and the small business lender in the United States according to FDIC data. This solid activity means the commercial customers continue to fair well. These are tangible examples that the U.S. economy is in solid shape despite the worries and concerns about trade wars, capital investment slowdowns or other global macro conditions. Now let us turn to slide 3. Across nearly every line of business, we are seeing strong customer activity. You can see that on the slide. I won't take you through all the statistics here, but let me highlight a few. On the consumer business on the left-hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average from the industry average for many periods. It's actually dramatic that we're gaining market share and not just in balances, but year to date, we've seen something that's interesting to us. We've had a 2% growth in a number of net checking households, a $700,000 increase. This is the fourth year of good growth in net checking households after a decade of consolidation of accounts, relationships and other changes to our business that began a decade ago to reposition. It is also record levels at primary accounts and record levels at total balances and average balances in those checking accounts. 92% of our customers we have the primary checking account in the household, and the average balance is – reaches $7,000. Now, through a renewed focus on growth in our Wealth Management franchise – Andy Sieg and Katy Knox are leading the charge – and we've seen net new Merrill Lynch and private banking relationships up over 30% plus in each case. And we're expanding the franchise by bringing our retail franchise, our Consumer Banking franchise, to markets we have long established Wealth Management or commercial client coverage. Paul is going to cover the continued growth and digital uses across our client base, which provides an important dual benefit of strong customer service and lower cost structures. Now, on the Commercial and Corporate side, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, as well as Institutional Investor coverage we have, we're also growing the client bases. We have been investing in the client-facing teammates in our Commercial Banking for a few years, and we have increased our investment banking coverage, especially in the middle market. And we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office. As you can see, these efforts are deepening relations with 3% growth in solutions per household, customer relationship and commercial. This investment has led to an improvement in our client coverage and investment banking market share. Earlier this quarter, my teammate, Tom Montag, highlighted some of the gains we were making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference. We expect to see that – we've seen that continued success and we expect for it to continue in the future as we continue to bring our capabilities to our great Commercial Banking franchise in United States. Let's turn to slide 4. This increase in client activity can be seen in the growth in deposit loans. On slide 4, we look at the deposits. Average deposits grew $59 billion or 4.35% year-over-year. For four years now, we have grown deposits compared to the prior year, for every one of those quarters, by more than $40 billion when compared to the year before, all while we've improved the mix of deposits. Deposits with our consumers grew $38 billion in total or 4%, reflecting the value clients place on the relationship benefits offered by the convenience of our network, the value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique Preferred Rewards program. Global Wealth Management was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash in lieu of investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018. Our Consumer Banking deposits grew by $22 billion or 3% year-over-year. More importantly, you can see in the right-hand – upper right-hand side of the slide that these came from checking balance growth. One additional point we focus on here is the long-term trend of deposit growth even in a moving rate environment. When the Fed started raising rates at the end of 2015, many of you had questions as whether our deposits could continue to grow and what rates we'd have to pass through to customers. Since the end of 2015, our average Consumer Banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, 75% of that coming from checking accounts. These balance are either no interest or very low interest  on a (00:08:41) core relationship in the households of America. Our rate paid remains low due to that superior mix of deposits. Now, when you look at Global Banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior Global Transaction Services capabilities. As we move to slide 5, we see the loan side of the equation. Overall, average loans are up nearly 4% year-over-year despite selling about $9 billion of non-core consumer real estate loans out of the All Other category over the last year. Average loans in our line of business grew $52 billion or 6% year-over-year, as both consumer and commercial loans both grew at a 6% pace. Middle market borrowing, as I said earlier, continued to complement large corporate financing. As you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, we continue to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible loan growth in our Commercial businesses in all our business segments. Within Consumer, you'll note the strong residential mortgage growth but also the more stable credit card balances which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable – promotional balances down while driving core balances and our relationship especially in Preferred Rewards capabilities. Within Commercial, I want to highlight a couple of areas of activity. It's important to understand as you think about Commercial clients in the state of the U.S. economy. First, as I said earlier, small business lending. Over the last year, we've grown small business loans 6%, regaining our market position as the number one lender to small businesses in the United States. Supplying capital to small business is very important as they're the key driver of employment in the US. As we continue to innovate around capabilities and offerings to an important client base, another portfolio within our commercial loans and leases book is our global equipment financing portfolio. Growth in this portfolio is a sign that commercial clients are investing capital in the US economy at a faster pace than the overall economic growth. This portfolio is $65 billion and it grew $6.5 billion-plus or 11% in the past 12 months. This reflects investments by clients in equipment to drive their business, invest in renewable energy products. These are just a couple examples when our stable lending portfolio is growing and supporting clients in a real economy and growing the size of smaller competitors' entire lending portfolios. As we look to the expense side of the equation on slide 6, we've been driving a responsible growth. Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which means we self-fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary costs, to keep expenses relatively flat while we continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new teammates. Slide 6 shows the two-year expense trend here. I'll talk about the expenses in slide 6 excluding the impairment charge we took in our investment in Bank of America merchant services. We have been operating a tight range of $13 billion to $13.3 billion with only one exception for the last few years. So we've been able to operate at $53 billion annualized expense base despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure, buildings and people and philanthropy and other costs. At $13.1 billion this quarter, we were basically flat compared to quarter 3 2018 despite elevated litigation costs of about $350 million compared to a fixed quarter run rate of about $100 million per quarter. Regarding head count, year-over-year head count went up. It went up in the sales professional category by 1,700 people. We offset that cost through reduction in other teammates. As you look to the next slide, slide 7, you see the familiar operating leverage trend which has been a highlight for the firm's culture, funding investments through operational earnings. Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings. We're able to keep operating leverage relatively flat. Essentially, expenses and revenue grew about $500 million – less than $500 million each. On a more core operating basis, taking account the elevated litigation, you could see operating leverage even in this difficult NII environment. As I've said before, generating operating leverage does get tougher. We told you that over the last several quarters after four successful years of keeping expenses, declining and holding relatively flat. This will continue especially as we work through periods of interest rate cuts, but we remain focused on our mission to continue to grow revenue faster than expenses. The question we ask ourselves is how much flexibility? And the question you ask us is how much flexibility we want to leverage from initiative spending on technology or infrastructure or hiring, or we just keep – or do we keep investing to build our market share momentum? As we talk to the investors who own substantial portions of our stock, they continue to tell us to invest in our client customer successes, to take advantage of our strong position and continue to invest in times. But even with that, you can see in this chart that we maintain our discipline around operating leverage. With that, I'm going to turn over to Paul for a few details in the quarter. Thanks, Brian. I'm starting on slide 8 with the balance sheet. Overall, compared to the end of Q2, the balance sheet grew $30 billion, driven by loan growth which ended the quarter more than $9 billion higher. We also grew the balance sheet in Global Markets to support additional client activity. Liquidity remained strong as average liquidity sources were unchanged, linked quarter. Shareholders' equity declined $3 billion, driven by a $2 billion decline in common equity, as positive OCI from lower rates and net income totaling $7 billion was more than offset by $9 billion of capital returned to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. The remaining $1 billion decline in equity resulted from the redemption of preferred stock in Q3 after issuing lower yielding preferred shares in Q2. With respect to regulatory metrics, we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements. Regarding CET1 ratios, given the reduction in capital I just reviewed, our CET1 ratio, standardized, decreased to 11.4%, which is nearly 200 basis points above our minimum requirement. And as mentioned in our SEC filing, the impairment charge recorded this quarter reduced regulatory capital but had no impact on our capital plans announced in July. Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly as a result of increased client activity and higher loan balances across the businesses. Lastly, our TLAC ratios also remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide 9 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII was $12.2 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q3 2018, GAAP NII was up $126 million or 1%. The year-over-year improvement reflects solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year. As you know, lower rates are a headwind. The Fed cut short-term rates in July and September, and average long-end rates are down over 100 basis points year-over-year. However, versus the linked quarter, GAAP NII was flat. There were two primary negative impacts to NII in the quarter. First, lower short-term rates reduced yield on floating rate assets. And second, because of lower long-term rates, we experienced faster prepayments on mortgaged-back securities increasing the level of bond premium write-offs. Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt, and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits. In addition, Global Markets NII benefited from lower funding costs and a shift in mix of client activity. While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines. In fact, sales and trading revenue in the quarter which includes both NII and trading account profits was down slightly versus Q2. With regard to deposit pricing, we were disciplined. First, note that customers who have borrowed from us on a variable rate basis benefited from an approximate 30 basis point decline in LIBOR on a linked quarter basis. At the same time, we lowered the rates on interest-bearing deposits by 5 basis points to 76 basis points. Roughly half of our $1.37 trillion deposit booked in our Consumer Banking businesses, where our customer pricing remained relatively unchanged, while the deposit rate we pay in Global Banking and Wealth Management declined 12 basis points versus Q2. As you know, in our banking book, we have more variable rate assets than variable rate liabilities given the quality of our deposits, particularly in Consumer Banking. This makes us asset sensitive in our banking book, or perhaps it would be more descriptive to call us liability-insensitive. In any case, this asset sensitivity increased compared to Q2, driven by the forward curve at the end of September which was lower than the curve at the end of Q2. Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018. That expectation has not changed despite the lower long-end rates and the expectation for another short-end rate cut in Q4, nor have we changed our expectation that Q4 NII  (00:19:08) to the Q3. In Q4, we expect the decline in short-term rates will more fully affect yield on our variable rate assets. In addition, given the decline in long-end rates over the past couple of quarters, reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages is expected to dilute current portfolio yields. However, LIBOR rates have reduced the cost of our long-term debt and the funding of our Global Markets business. This, plus loan and deposit growth are expected to partially offset the headwinds. Turning to asset quality on slide 10, we saw no meaningful change in asset quality which continues to be strong. We have maintained our responsible underwriting standards for years now, and we remain disciplined again this quarter in a relatively solid US economy. Similar to Q2, we sold some non-core consumer real estate loans where the sales price was above our carrying value due to prior charge-offs. This resulted in recoveries that reduced net charge-offs and provision expense in both Q3 and Q2 this year. Recoveries in Q3 and in Q2 were $198 million and $118 million, respectively. Including these recoveries, total net charge-offs in Q3 were $811 million compared to $887 million in Q2. Adjusting for the charge-offs – excuse me, adjusting for the recoveries, excuse me, net charge-offs were just over $1 billion in both periods and the net charge-off ratio would be 42 basis points in Q3 and 43 basis points in Q2. On that adjusted basis and comparing to Q3 2018, net charge-offs were $77 million higher, reflecting modestly higher commercial losses and seasoning of card losses. Provision expense was $779 million and included a modest $32 million net reserve release. The prior-year period included a $216 million reserve release, driven in part by energy releases. On slide 11, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. And as you can see, asset quality remains strong. Consumer nonperforming loans declined as a result of loan sales. And in Commercial, ratios tracking nonperforming loans and reservable criticized exposure remained near historic lows. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 12, Consumer Banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth. Earnings grew 5% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. Revenues grew 3%. We believe our efficiency ratio of 45%, which is one of the lowest among our peers, is driven by our digital delivery platform and simplified product offerings which enables not only ease of use, but also efficiency. Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace, and client activity remained strong with respect to loan and deposit growth as well as consumer spending. Again, this quarter, we added salespeople, expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers as well as small businesses. And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposits year-over-year declined to 150 basis points, nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid which is now 11 basis points. Deposit growth was up $22 billion or 3% and centered in low-rate checking. Loan growth was up 7% year-over-year. The low long-term rate environment continued to generate momentum in consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion. Asset quality in this segment remained strong as the net charge-off ratio was 118 basis points, down modestly from both last year and the previous quarter. In addition, we saw origination spreads improve in both mortgage and consumer vehicle lending during the quarter. Consumer Investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, as strong client flows were partially offset by market declines. Turning to slide 13, note that our 3% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by both NII as well as fees. NII benefited from deposit and loan growth. Card income was up 4% year-over-year as we experienced solid spending levels, partially offset by Rewards which continue to be a headwind. Each quarter, we show you the improvement in the consumer digital statistics which are highlighted on slide 14. Customers continue to transact and interact with us in person as well as through digital channels, so we continue to invest in both by adding financial centers and renovating existing ones, as well as enhancing and adding capabilities to our number one ranked digital banking platform. In fact, over the past year, we have opened 98 financial centers, renovated 562, and installed nearly 1,000 ATMs, and remain on track to hit our buildout targets. This includes opening financial centers in three new major US markets in the past year where we had previously no retail presence. And remember, while many are new markets, additions from a retail perspective, other lines of businesses like Commercial Banking, Merrill and our Private Bank have been serving customers for decades in these markets. Turning to digital, in the third quarter we saw nearly 2.5 billion consumer interactions across all channels, with digital accounting for more than  $2 billion (00:25:34) (00:25:35) and digital sales now represent 26% of total sales. And by the way, our digital and physical worlds are increasingly connected and synergistic. Digital appointments are a great example of that. 13% of our financial center platform traffic is now driven by appointments set in advance. This allows us to better prepare and staff for the specific needs of our customers and improve their experience Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 15, strong results were aided by growth across AUM, loans and deposits and generally good market conditions in the quarter. Client balances are approaching $3 trillion as a result of flows and market valuations. Referrals across the company remained strong. Net income was $1.1 billion and grew 8% from Q3 2018. Pre-tax margin was a record 30%. The business created nearly 300 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased 2% while expenses declined 1%. Within revenue, positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher. Asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures. Transactional revenue declined modestly versus Q3 2018. With respect to expenses, investment in sales professionals, technology, and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs. Mobile channel usage among Wealth Management households grew 45%. Moving to slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the Private Bank. Strong household growth contributed to higher client balances, which exceeded $2.9 trillion. AUM flows were nearly $6 billion in Q3 or $21 billion in the past 12 months, boosting AUM balances to a record $1.2 trillion. On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year, driven by client growth and a 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds. Average loans were 5% higher year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in mortgage and custom lending. As you turn to slide 17, before I review the slide, and as I've done in the past, I want to provide summary information on Global Banking and Global Markets on a combined basis to allow comparison against competitors that may not break out these businesses separately. So, on a combined basis, these two segments grew revenue to $9.1 billion and earned nearly $3 billion in Q3, generated return of more than 15% on their combined allocated capital. Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking, the business earned $2.1 billion and generated return of more than 20% on allocated capital. Earnings were strong, up 3% from Q3 2018, driven by an increase in investment banking income and leasing-related gains. The year-over-year growth in earnings was mitigated by the absence of prior-year reserve leases primarily from energy exposures. Growth in investment banking fees was the largest contributor to the 8% improvement in revenue year-over-year. Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services. Expenses were up 4% as we continue to invest in technology and client-facing associates. Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year, as you heard Brian mention earlier and Tom discussed at an investor conference last month, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the past year. Our steady progress with clients is reflected in both our improved fees as well as market share rankings and league tables. IB fees in Q3 were more than $1.5 billion for the overall firm up 27% year-over-year. Advisory was particularly strong at approximately $450 million as we advised on five of the top ten transactions completed in the quarter.  Owing (00:30:11) to our strength in leadership in credit underwriting, activity in debt capital markets was strong with some record weeks of debt issuance. In Q3, we continued to add regional investment bankers with a focus on expanding our geographic coverage in the US to match our coverage model and market leadership in commercial banking cross the US. One of the reasons for growth in deposits in Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities within our Transaction Services platform. Referring to slide 19, note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page. Treasurers are looking for the same type of convenience as consumers, and our consumer and commercial teams work closely together to leverage technology advancement and drive usage and adoption of mobile and digital solutions. We now have over 500,000 CashPro users and mobile CashPro users doubled year-over-year. Mobile payment approvals by these users were $144 billion over the past 12 months, nearly doubling year-over-year. Switching to Global Markets on slide 20, as I usually do, I will talk about the results excluding DVA. Global Markets produced $858 million in earnings. When comparing results year-over-year and quarter over quarter, note that both prior periods included similar sized equity investment gains that were noted in previous earnings calls. And in both cases, these gains were not included in sales and trading results. Year-over-year, revenue was down 2% as the segment's share of improved investment banking fees and the modest improvement in sales and trading did not offset the prior year's gain on an equity investment. Sales and trading improved 4% year-over-year. FICC was flat with Q3 2018 while equities improved 13%. Fixed revenue showed improved results in mortgage trading and municipal trading but was weaker in FX and credit products. The improvement in equities to $1.15 billion was driven by growth in client-facing activities as well as continued – as well as we continue to invest in our equity financing products. In 2019, in equities, we added new clients and increased our market share with existing ones. Benefit derives from increased scale have improved the efficiency of our balance sheet as well as return metrics. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year as we continue to invest in technology, plus Brexit preparedness continued to add expense. On slide 21, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products. Finally, on slide 22, we show All Other which reported a loss of $1.6 billion. Results here included the joint venture impairment charge. Excluding this charge the segment would have reported a profit of roughly $100 million. A few other items impact the results here. First, provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion. Second, the elevated litigation expense Brian mentioned is booked here. And third, the effective tax rate this quarter was 16% and included discrete benefits booked here and related to the resolution of several tax matters. We continued to expect the effective tax rate in Q4 of around 19% excluding unusual items. Okay. With that, let's just open it up to Q&A. We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, I'll ask the question and you can decide not to answer. But just, if there is any help you can give us on sort of the NII outlook beyond 4Q. I know there's a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve, and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here. Thanks. Sure. So, let me start with the premium amortization. I'm not going to give you any precise number, but if you think about the extra day we had from Q2 to Q3, the increase in premium amortization in the quarter more than offset that. In terms of – but going forward, unless long-end rates fall meaningfully from here, we wouldn't expect that level of increase in premium amortization in Q4 even next year without significant increase – significant decrease in long-end rates. In terms of the outlook for 2020, obviously, that's going to be highly dependent on future Fed activity on deposit pricing across the industry. We don't think it's really prudent right now to provide specific guidance at this point. You have our thoughts on – I'm sure we're going to be talking about Q4, and you have our thoughts on that from our prepared remarks. You'll also going to have our asset sensitivity disclosures. So, the only thing I would remind you is when you think about Q1, we will have one less day of interest, which impacts NII by about $80 million. But we'll get that day back in the third quarter. Right. So, maybe just a follow-up on that just on the balance sheet growth. It seems like both loans and deposits have accelerated a little bit. You indicated some pretty strong trends in sort of new account growth in both Consumer and Wealth. And coupled with sort of a lower rate environment, do you see deposit growth picking up across – you had good in commercial across the Consumer franchise broadly whether it's wealth or traditional banking? Yeah, I think we have, if you go back many quarters ago, we discussed – our thought process is to tell our teammates the price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster than the economy, which means  your axiomatic (00:37:07) point there is you're getting share at all times if the economy is growing less. So, they've been doing that. We are staying very careful and disciplined. There were some adjustments made on the Wealth Management business. If you look back last year, we had some growth there that we slowed down because it was a little too tied to bidding too much for rate. They changed that process. They flattened out. Now, they're growing again. On the commercial side, the changes of interest bearing and non-interest bearing and the fees for services and all that stuff, calculations change. But I'd say you should expect us to continue to grow at the rate we're growing now or faster because frankly, we've been very disciplined about how we've been driving against core checking accounts on the Consumer side, core checking and savings accounts in the Wealth Management business and obviously, GTS business. And so, I'd expect it to continue to grow maybe faster than 3%, 4%, 5%. But the thing about that is, that is incredible amounts of new customers at very advantaged pricing that we can put to work. Great. That's great. Thanks. I think one thing, Jim, just to... Yeah. ...as I said in my prepared remarks, there was a lot of discussion when the Fed started raising rates, what would happen? And what I said back there was consumer increased their deposit balances by about $145 billion since the first Fed rate increase and now there's been two decreases, right? So, think about that machine just churning out growth and growth and growth. 75% of that was checking balances. That's the real encouraging part of the story in Consumer. All-time customer satisfaction, high in those businesses. All-time employee satisfaction, high. All-time customer growth rates, high for 15 years or so. And you just take that and play it out. It's pretty important. Yeah, it seems like it could be a good leading indicator. Thanks. Now our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Oh, hi. I'm a little stuck on slide 7 with the efficiency. And you mentioned all the investing that you're doing. So, are you willing to go to negative operating leverage with the investments? Like you had the new salespeople in the branches and you had more deposit growth. You have new regional banking coverage. You have more investment banking. So, the investments are paying off. So, what's your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year? You're not giving specific guidance. But more generally, what's the role of technology inside the firm that's enabling this operating leverage? For example, how many data centers do you have and how many are you going to close? What percent of your applications do you expect to migrate to the cloud? Just a little bit more color of what's happening behind the scenes that enables your operating leverage and your expectations for continuing that. Yeah. And, Mike, those are good questions. I think we are going to invest in the long-term value of this company and our clients. And so if this quarter we were sort of flattish on operating leverage, if we happen to go negative, I'd argue then that was the right things to do based on everything we're assessing at the time. You do it. These quick changes in rates obviously have an impact that you then outgrow with the volumes coming in and producing the value, but that takes some compounding through the quarter. So our attitude in talking to our investors is if we're gaining share and doing the right things, keep going. But the real key is back to sort of your second question which is we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment and the changes the way this company operates that continue to push through. And so two-and-a-half years ago, we said we'd operate this year on $53 billion and change in expenses, and we hit that number. And a lot of you had us in at $57 billion or something like that. Next year, we told you we'd be in the low 53s again and we still are sticking to that. And so that's – three, four years out, you're saying, how can you plan that with all the investments we're making? That is because we know we're making investments at the same time they're taking out cost. The cloud journey for Bank of America is an interesting one. We started about really the new BAC framework. For those of you who remember that, it came out of that, in just early days is simplify and improve. We had 200,000-plus servers. Those server count is now down to 70,000. The first decision we made was to actually create an internal cloud. Those servers were operating about 30%, 60-some data centers, very much dedicated by line of business, by operational unit, by risk or whatever. We took all that away and built common architecture. So the lion's share of our applications run around 8,000 servers. We still have 70,000 servers but those are more dedicated for very specific things and we'll continue to work to take them down. We're down to 23 data centers, so it's been around the company for a while now. We took a $350 million charge a few years in the second quarter of 2017 to pay for part of this changeover. But in that timeframe, we've reduced expenses by basically around 40% or $2 billion a year on our backbone. And so at the same time, if you looked on pages 14 and 19, you can see just over the last couple years the volume of transactions. So we're up 86% in mobile logins, we're up 39% in wire transactions and things like that. So what you've had is this scale effect that we've been able to internalize, and our provision in these services from what we can get in the external cloud is still 25%, 30% cheaper which we expect to change, honestly. And so we're working with potential providers to take the next step which was discrete data centers and resources to internal cloud, save a ton of money, then use that power to actually negotiate with third parties to how they might help you and support you. And that's going on with Cathy Bessant and her team right now and Howard Boville runs this for us. But so far, we're still cheaper. And so far, we have to make sure that the external providers are safe, sound, leave the data just for us to use with our customers, don't mix it with our people's data, etcetera. And that discussion negotiation goes on as we speak. But we don't need to own the hardware. We just need to find out who can provide it the right way. Well, thanks for providing data that others have not provided yet. So just one follow-up then. Again, still behind this is you're getting the operating efficiency while you're making investments. You're doing stuff behind the scenes like this. So if you've gone from 60 data centers to 23 data centers, how much further do you have to go? If you've gone from 200,000 servers to 70,000 servers, how much more do you have to go? And what percent of your applications do you expect to migrate to the cloud over time? The last question I'd leave to people with more expertise. But, Mike, in the spirit of constant improvement, I never give people a number that I'm satisfied with and you shouldn't either. In other words, if we think we can – we're at X for Howard and the team in this case or any of our businesses, you can improve it every day. So that is the cultural change we made in this company and, frankly, the stability of having not had any acquisition activity since 2009 and anything other than organic movement. You can plan these things out and execute them, and some of these things take three to four years to get done. So you have to be patient, you have to be consistent, you have to keep allocating investments to them to cause a change to happen and then be disciplined about the cost coming out the other side. But I'll never tell people we're done because then they'd stop working at it. All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks very much. I'm curious now that you'd taken the charge on the merchant servicing JV. I'm curious about the go-forward, like can you talk a little bit about what is built? What do you want to build? Is there going to be an impact on expenses that we'll see and how soon we'll see progress? And what we'd see? Just, yeah, curious to learn more. Sure, Glenn. Let me start with a high-level comment and then I'll let Paul – because remember, many of you don't probably remember that Paul ran GTS for a while and had as part of his portfolio. But he can hit some of the details. But philosophically, we wanted to control our destiny to be able to provide this service to our clients in a much cleaner way, and we had a great partner in FDR and, at some point, that was good for what was going on in the world, then it has changed. So we're making a change. So a lot of the discussions on terms of where we take this, the team is working with FDR closely to unwind the venture as per the contract, et cetera. But it's been a good relationship. We expect that to continue in various ways. But on the other hand, we had to get control of our destiny, the sales force, the implementation. Paul, why don't you hit some of the pieces in terms of the numbers and  with that, can (46:05) sort of what impact on expenses and things like that, revenue? Yeah. I mean, I guess in terms of expenses, I would remind you that the accounting for BAMS doesn't change until the JV actually ends in June. That's the first point. And so when you get out to Q3 2020, we'll begin reporting our share of the revenue and our share of the expenses versus today where we record that share as net earnings in the other income line under the equity accounting method. Right. As we sit here today, given all we have to do between now and then, we're not disclosing specifics. There's a lot of work to do and the bottom line impact is really not that impactful. As we get closer to I think the actual dissolution, we'll give you some more guidance. Do you have a lot to build in terms of being able to service clients and deliver everything that you want to deliver to them? Everything that you're doing now, I'm assuming your current partner is doing, so I'm just curious how much of that you can do behind the scenes as you lead up to June 2020. I mean, we're working on our plans and we have a fair amount to do. But as you think about technology spend and incremental build cost, I would – that's going to be prioritized within our normal $3 billion or plus a year that we're investing. Okay. Brian, maybe one just high-level one on loan growth. I think growing loans, core loans 6% in a 2% world like you described would be considered great by most metrics. Just curious if you think that's sustainable, if we're going to sustain this 2% world. Yeah. I think, ebb and flow, and you've seen it otherwise. If you look at that one page on the lower right-hand corner, it shows you across 6% to 3% to 6% for Commercial. So what have we been doing that's helping drive that? One of the major things we did is I think if you calculate it, we have four segments which go against commercial lending. The Small Business segment in our Consumer business, the Business Banking segment, the Global Commercial Banking segment which most of you call Middle Market, and then our GCIB for large companies. If you look across those segments especially in Small Business, and importantly in Business Banking and Global Commercial Banking, Ather Williams runs Business Banking and Alastair Borthwick, those guys have been investing in head count and people and relationship management. And a precise number for each of them, but think 25% more bankers today than there were three years ago, which gave us an opportunity to divide the portfolios of clients further so people had less clients to get more depth to relationship. And that's why you see the statistics about the key products per relationship. And then secondly, with the capacity we added to get new relationships, all consistent with our credit. So we often get asked you're growing consumers for loans. We're not – we always ask ourselves, okay, are we sticking to our credit standards, and we've been able to do that. So I think it's sustainable in mid-single digits, maybe 6% is a little higher, maybe 5%, maybe 4%, maybe 6% if the economy's at 2%. But this taking market share because of the deployment of the capabilities into the Middle Market and Business Banking franchises, along with some of the work that is anything on with investment banking and others is a good place to be. And it's a three or four-year investment. It takes about three years to get a commercial bank or coming in our franchise up to speed, honestly. And then on top of that, there's a fellow named  Robert Slicer (49:53) who runs a group that does the underwriting process for the whole enterprise behind all these businesses. And we've invested tremendously in the technology and in support of that group for their underwriting capabilities, turnaround time, all the things. And that is allowing us to, frankly, have as we're told the fastest turnaround time of banks, large, small, or bigger or smaller. And so we feel that we're creating the kind of competitive advantage that this franchise has embedded in. Awesome. Thank you, Brian. Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Hi. Wanted to follow up on Jim's questions around NII, Paul. You mentioned the full-year outlook for the 1% hasn't changed. The prior outlook for the fourth quarter was to be around $12 billion. You came in a little bit higher this quarter. Just as we think about jumping off pointing to next year, are you still thinking about a fourth quarter NII around that $12 billion? Is that a fair reading of your disclosures and things like that? Yeah, that's a fair reading. Okay. And then just could you remind us how to read those disclosures and think about the impact of another Fed cut from here? There's some differences to the 10-Q disclosure you mentioned prior, like it's only the banking book, it's relative to the forward curve. How should we net all that and think about what one rate cut is if we're going to model that going forward? Sure. So you'll have our sensitivity disclosures and our normal filings. But when you look at them, you're going to see that over the next – and if the Fed were to cut rates by 25 basis points – and remember that disclosure is beyond the forward curve which has three rate cuts in it, right? But if you look at that disclosure, you'll see that full 100 basis points would equate to around $3.3 billion on the short end. You just divide by 16, and you're going to get the impact on a quarterly basis of about $200 million. But it's going to be a little bit less than that because, again, that forward curve includes three rate cuts and then you're talking about 100 basis points on top of that. And so you'd literally be – that forward curve will literally – I mean that sensitivity disclosure literally means you'd should be at zero interest rates. And, obviously, the next rate cut will not going to be at zero interest rates. So it's not going to be the full $200 million when you do the math on that disclosure. In addition, as you point out or allude to, that's just our banking book. And if you include Global Markets which is modestly liability sensitive, that decline would be even further mitigated. Okay. So something I think you've said maybe before in the $125 million to $175 million or something less than $200 million. Yeah, it's going to be less than $200 million. And I'd even tell you it's going to be meaningfully less than $200 million. John, so these things – I know you guys would like us to round it out to 6 digits each time and give it to you for the next years, but the reality is we gave you an estimate for this quarter, last quarter – I mean, fourth quarter, the current quarter, and we gave it to you last quarter. And in fact there's been more rate cuts and we are still holding the same guidance of $12 billion and change. And that shows you that we're managing the heck to try to avoid some of these impacts and how it  piles (53:28) deposits and better growth in deposits when maybe estimating that. So there's a lot of estimation. But we're trying to get it thematically as Paul has talked about over time, but it's not this imprecise. There's just a lot of moving parts that frankly we've managed better than we thought we could. I totally get it. And I totally appreciate it, Brian. Just with that, one more nitpick, Paul. Just from the third to the fourth quarter, $12.3 billion this quarter. The pressures that you have in the fourth is kind of the combination of the LIBOR and then also the premium am. Is that why you could come down a little more than $200 million in the fourth quarter, and, again, subject to all the caveats? Look, as you're thinking about the second quarter to the third quarter, remember we have one extra day. We had a second rate cut that came at the end of the quarter. So as we sit here today, we don't have that extra day. We've got two rate cuts fully baked in that are going to affect asset yields, plus you've got in that forward curve, so everything we're talking about here assumes the forward curve. You've got another rate cut. I already told you that I thought that the premium amort would not be significant, anywhere near as significant as it was second quarter to the third quarter. We're going to have loan and deposit growth. We're going to have – we're going to – again, as Brian just said, work hard on all the other levers we have like deposit pricing. And so you get to – I'm not giving you guidance. I gave you kind of how to think about it based upon those sensitivity disclosures. But that's why it's a little bit different going from 3Q to 4Q versus Q2 to 3Q. Okay. Great. Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Good morning, Betsy. Hi. Good morning. The question that we get with everybody we speak with is around how you're thinking about the competition in retail brokerage with some of the e-brokers obviously going to zero  commission (55:42) cash and options, and different players, different price points there on different products. But just wanted to understand how you think about that. I realize it's a small piece of the revenue line you've got. But just want to see if you think that this is at all something that you need to address in the marketplace. So Betsy, let me take that, because as you remember right, I had that business when we introduced zero dollar commissions in 2006. So it's not a new concept to Bank of America. And so about 87% of that current commission – current trades are zero dollars in the area in the Merrill Edge and the self-directed platform that's been true forever. So this is not a change to our operating strategy. But we don't focus on trying to drive a pure trading type of thing. We think about the relationship and the Merrill Edge and things like that. So if you look at the consumer investment assets on page 13, you can see they're up $20 billion year-over-year. We're driving a whole relationship into these managed portfolios. That's based on financial advice, too. Yeah, we still have a very confident, capable,  (56:56) competition. We have a very strong platform that grows also. But the zero dollar change won't affect us much largely because we frankly entered this 13 years ago. Right. That's with preferred accounts. Yeah. And so when people look at page 16 and they see the brokerage rev line there, it's like $700 million this quarter. That is really commission on other things than stocks and options. Is that a fair way to read it? That's really not relevant here because that's in the Wealth Management business. Where this stuff shows up is actually back in the Consumer side because Merrill Edge is in that area, and that's where the lion's share of this is. So that $700 million is the financial advisory team under Andy selling things, the closed end funds, muni bonds, the stocks and a lot of other things. So that's been under pressure for years, and as you well know it's a constant change of fighting the average yield for the total client assets in that business. But that's not affected by this decision. Got it. And you'll see us push a little bit on some of the qualifications to open up this capability in other set of clients. But we only have 13% less to go. Got it. Okay. And then just separately, one more question on NII, Paul, if you don't mind. But in the quarter, the Markets NII helped out this quarter, I believe, and just let me know if I'm reading that right. Yeah, yeah. You're reading it right. Markets NII went up this quarter. And we've said that the Markets business is liability sensitive, so it does help NII if rates decline. I just would point out that we really manage that business looking at total sales and trading revenue, not NII. And although the trading book is liability sensitive, it is really important to remember that client activity and product mix in Global Markets can vary quarter over quarter and will drive sort of income statement geography which can produce an increase as you saw this quarter in NII or maybe reduce NII in another quarter with the offset that is going to be in trading account profits. So that's why the real key here is to focus on the sales and trading disclosures as opposed to the mix between NII and trading account profits. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Saul Martinez questions with UBS. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. I'll also ask a question on NII. The one – it seems like obviously third quarter is a little bit better than maybe expected and you're retaining the 1% growth in – kind of applies $12 billion for the fourth quarter. You obviously have had rates come in, long-end come in, forward curve's pricing and at least two more rate cuts, but it also feels like maybe you're a little bit more optimistic then about the NII trajectory than you were maybe earlier this quarter. Is that a fair reading, Paul? And if so, I mean, what makes you a little bit more optimistic about your ability to sustain NII? Is it just that loan growth is coming in better, you've been able to reprice deposits a little bit faster? What gives you a little bit – what makes you a little bit confident that your NII trajectory could be a little bit better than what you thought maybe even a couple months ago? I think we do feel good, and I think we feel that way because we've seen how our teams are performing in a different interest rate environment. We've seen how our teams and our clients by the way have reacted to appropriate adjustments on deposit pricing given the change in LIBOR. But remember, all of our clients are getting a huge benefit in what they're paying on their loans. So it's appropriate to adjust deposit pricing. I think we're obviously growing loans and deposits well. We've deepened relationships and we've improved our capability to service on both the loan and deposit side. So I think it's just another quarter under our belt where rates were different and we've seen how the teams have performed and we're feeling good. Okay. Now, that's helpful. And on the deposit cost side, you did – I mean, obviously, the interest-bearing deposit costs were down 5 basis points and it seems like that's going to be – given the limited scope in Retail, Wealth and Commercial, you're being proactive there as you should. But you're coming from a lower starting point on deposit cost than most of your competitors to begin with. So I mean can you just talk to how much more room you feel like you have as we get further along in the rate cycle? How difficult does it become? Or does it become more difficult to be more proactive in terms of lowering your deposit cost? I think back in the earlier discussion that sort of general guidance we give our teams is you have to get a 3% – in the current economic environment, we want to see 3% in core growth and deposit, and you have to then price to achieve that both, and then also at the same time achieve your goals on NII and things like that. So I think we try to be consistent. We value relationships. We focus on the core. On the Commercial side, the GTS relationships sort of drive the economics in the business as you well know. On the Wealth Management side, we're driving not only the investment cash but all the transactional cash. And you have to think of those as two separate executions, and putting teammates investing – by putting teammates into the Merrill Lynch offices, we can help the clients, associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that which helps. And then on the Consumer side, obviously, it's just the power of the brand and the franchise and digital competency. But we don't let people off the hook either way. We want them to grow. We want them to grow with the pricing that if somebody comes in and says, I can grow by issuing a bunch of term CDs at premium price, we say that's kind of interesting, but that doesn't qualify for what we want. And then if you look at it by business, you're seeing we decide the movements as rates moved up and following, you're seeing as you stabilize and even come down a little bit, you're seeing them able to continue to grow and managing rate paid carefully. And should we expect non-interest-bearing deposits to grow disproportionately in this environment? It seems with lower rates, things like higher yielding CDs become less attractive and this is a – for a bank like you, to national bank and a great franchise and a national franchise, it seems like a pretty attractive environment, work environment for you guys to take share and suck up demand deposits at maybe a faster rate than some of your peers. I think, yes, we expect to grow at a faster rate than our peers. That's kind of axiomatic when you're getting the shares really. But if you look at the slides on the deposits, you can see that growth in Consumer drives the equation on the non-interest-bearing and very low interest cost deposits. And the team there are doing – and the team have done a good job of they've gone from 6 basis points to 11 basis points. That's due to mix. And as Paul said earlier, we are liability insensitive to some degree because we have  some of (01:04:49) the mixed deposits. But you've got to remember, at $700 billion, 11 basis points, so $700-some million a year of cost. There's only so much price leverage in there. So we say just keep growing and grow in the right categories. Yes, they have CDs, and the CDs grew year-over-year. The only thing I will add there is I think you all know this but if interest rates are lower, then deposit rate paid is less important relative to all the other things people – reasons why people invest with us, or I should say deposit with us. So theoretically, you might see more deposit growth in a lower interest rate environment because trust is more important, the deep relationship they have with us across Preferred Rewards and other things we do with them. And mobile, the online capabilities, the nationwide network of financial centers, our global GTS capabilities, those all become more valuable to customers if rates are lower. Great. Thanks so much. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Hey, guys. Just a quick one. Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder and rate environment where it is. But as you look ahead and you've done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments? Like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that you haven't – maybe still haven't yet attacked that could still provide that underlying support? Thanks. Sure. I mean, we have the Operational Excellence platform which Tom Scribner had and now he's moved over to work on part of the Operations group under Cathy. But Anne Walker has – she has some improved. This is an ongoing program which has literally every manager in the company, a couple levels down from my team, constantly working on coming up with the mapping of the process, improving the process and asking for investment to help improve those processes. So there are areas where we're very digitized and very – no paper and very electronic, and you can think of that in some of the Consumer areas. There's areas where we're still just now getting the benefits of major investments. You may think about the underwriting area and Commercial that I talked about earlier that we're now bringing the people, the teammates on to the platform to drive it. And so all our platforms have major improvements available to them, even though we're very efficient and our efficiency ratio in each of the business units are industry-leading, part from our scale and part from just the discipline of our teammates. And we look at deployment of the relationship management talent. We're getting the calls and the customer visits and the productivity out of that. We're looking at – we continue to work on our real estate configurations that were down 50 million square feet in real estate from the start of 2010. And yeah, we don't satisfy ourselves in the occupancy rate. Can we push it up? Can we densify the space? The new building we built in New York will be all sort of this new modern style of work environment that will allow us to make economic a higher rental cost. And you look at every aspect of the company and continue to look at managers, we're down 10,000 managers over the last three or four years. That continues to drift down as we continue to look at what a manager does and how we test that. But if you let attrition work for us and by not hiring and making sure we're plentiful on hiring, we can drive it out. And so everyone wants to say what's the silver bullet? The answer is everywhere there's opportunities, and we don't know how far this goes with machine learning or artificial intelligence. These things you hear about are still in their infancy of being applied. And by the way, we spend $1.5 billion of data work over the last five, six years largely around all the CCAR stuff but ultimately – and some of the work we're doing. But, really, to get all the data rates, so actually the bots and things that can operate are operating on good data. And that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and we're still in early days;  Courts (01:09:12) that we invested in the Markets business. So it's from one side of the company to the other. And going to the earlier comment, what target do you have, the answer is that we don't have a target except to improve every month, day – the day, month, week and quarter. And we'll continue to do that. Thanks a lot, Brian. Our next question will come from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks. Just two quick questions here. On the Wealth and Investment Management, I heard that you were bringing down the noninterest expense. Can you go into a little bit more detail if there's still more that can be done on expenses in there? I mean it's surprising to see the positive operating leverage with the expenses down. Yeah. We have the pre-tax margin if you think about it. Once you pay the talent, teammates we have in the financial advisory platform and the private banking platform, you're working on about half the revenue. And we're getting 30% of that to the pre-tax line. So the idea is you've got to improve at all directions, not just expenses, and its efficiency expenses, simplification of product, especially for the clients with 500,000, 600,000, continuing to add straightforward products that are digitized on both the way they're delivered and the way they're – statement and everything. And then making the advisors able to handle more clients and that allows us to get more efficiency. Real estate configuration, there's a lot of paper still in this business just because the history of it. So they're probably in the first inning of – really it's a very digital business in some ways when you think about trades and how they go through, but it's a very paper intensive business in other ways. The way we do AML-KYC refreshes, we're going to recognize the team that took several hundred thousand hours out of the – or several thousand hours out of the work to do that. It's just a thousand things. But importantly also by driving the growth in loans and deposits and stuff, that is less – it creates more free tax profit margin frankly off the strength of the bank's balance sheet and the size of our company. And that gives us unique positioning. So we're running the industry-leading margins and we know we can continue to push them up. It is a very slow thing and we don't change the way we pay people. We really focus in on working around and making all our teammates ability to have a great career, make more money and serve their clients better while we keep making the place more efficient. And then a separate one, for the US cards, I mean, pretty solid, the gross interest yields still tick up in the quarter despite the rate cut and change in prime rates there. Was there something unique going on that allows you to kind of expand deals? The card portfolio, right? Correct, card portfolio. Yeah. Look, we've been focused on profitability. We have been careful about growth as we're growing. We're adding a million new cards a year, and again with a focus on profitability. So we've reduced – we've sort of scaled back on people we think are trying to game the system or just going after promotions. So that's improving the profitability overall. I think you saw that in the  RAM (01:12:46) that you're referencing which is up year-over-year. And that's mostly being driven by NII – I mean, NIM growth in the card. Great. Thanks. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, Matt. Good morning. If we look at your expenses ex the impairment and the legal cost, it's about $12.7 billion. Obviously, after you annualize that, it's below the $53 billion you're talking about next year. And I know there's some seasonality in the first half of the year that drives costs higher. But I guess, first, is there anything in the $12.7 billion that's kind of not sustainable or unusual? And why isn't there may be some downward flexibility to $53 billion? You mean to our benefit? You're saying to our benefits? Correct. Correct. Yeah. I think it's just the third quarter was just a little bit of timing. We're increasing our investment in people, in financial centers, in marketing. But it's not even throughout the whole year. So you've got to think about the guidance we have given for the full year as opposed to just any given quarter. Okay. So just some ebbing and flowing there? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, just ebbing and flowing on marketing and other areas which will rebound investments. We expect some of that to rebound in the fourth quarter. And Matt, that's why, maybe go back to that earlier page in the deck, why we should – if you think about the last couple years, there's always ebbing and flowing but we're showing that we're kind of holding it here. And as you look over the next couple years, we think we can hold it here. And then at some point, we'll start growing and we're trying to grow the – we're trying to spend 3% more a year but only grow the expense base 1% is kind of a long-term picture we're trying to take. Maybe 1% to 2% and with revenue growth that's 3% to 4% in a normal environment, that gives great operating leverage, and EPS growth, that's the long-term view that we keep holding to. When interest rates move quickly, those are things that  we deal with (01:14:53) but over time that's what you're trying to achieve. And so you can take that as where the general operating principle we push our teams towards. Okay. And then just separately, you talked about deposit growth potentially of 4% or 5% accelerating a little bit from where we're at right here. And then you talked about loan growth potentially being in the, call it 4% to 6% range. As you think about the overall balance sheet, should it grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and you'll see a little bit less earning asset growth? Yeah. Look, on the specific point, are there opportunities to bring down debt? There's a little bit of opportunity there. Our TLAC ratios are probably a little bit higher than we want them to be. But that was because we were adding a new bank in Dublin, adding a new broker dealer in Paris, and by the way, splitting up our broker dealer here in the US for resolution planning. So we have a little bit of opportunity there. I wouldn't make too much of a big deal about that. Basically, our balance sheet is going to grow as we grow deposits. With all that deposit growth going into loan growth, we still have the non-core portfolio running off a little bit. And whatever doesn't go to loans is going to go into the securities portfolio. And then you have the Markets business, which are also, because of the financing activities and equities, not a lot of risk, but notional growth to the balance sheet that you've seen. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And we will take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi, Brian. Hi, Gerard. How are you? Good. First, I just want to thank you and Bank of America for the continued support of the Bank Analyst Association Meeting you guys did at dinner every year like you're doing this year. So thank you very much. We really appreciate that. No problem. The second point, credit is very good for you folks and the industry. Can you share with us when you look out over the next cycle, where are you guys spending extra time today just making sure that you don't take your eye off the ball because of some potential problems that could be on the horizon? Well, Gerard, you asked the question of Paul and I and Jeff Green, our Chief Risk Officer, and, importantly, our Enterprise Risk Committee led by Frank Bramble of our Board of Directors. We keep saying how do we make sure that we're sticking to our knitting, so to speak. And you do that by – you see  on the scope (01:17:30) industry limits, country limits, leveraged underwriting limits. You pick, just limits after limits, house guidelines, exceptions. So I think one thing I think my peers and I would say is with stress testing and other things, you're required to think of the worst of times and hold capital for it. So I think in the industry generally, that has had a good – a great impact in terms of us all thinking through the long-term impacts. But importantly, the data and the capabilities that we built starting 10, 12 years ago are just tremendous. So when we asked the question we can actually see in very discrete areas where's our exposure to this or that or the other thing. And that's important because then you can manage at that level, and team under Jeff has done a great job of sort of bringing that data at the fore and making sure we're always watching all the different pieces. So Mick Ankrom who is in charge of credit risk of the company, I'll call him up after the Houston hurricanes a couple years ago. I said, Mick, what's our exposure? He said, what ZIP code do you want it for and which product do you want it for and do you want the card versus mortgage or people have both? And all that's just  (01:18:47) I think this is on like a Saturday night or something like that, not saying he doesn't have more fun things to do, but it's – so I think that allows us to keep track a bit. It's just all those limits and those granular limits and then the intrusion of the underwriting process requires really for any reasonably sized loan a risk manager to specifically sign off along with a banker. On a Commercial side and Consumer side, the parameters of that buy box with risk in doing that, it's kind of eaten in the system. It's not something people argue about or think about. So our real estate exposure is limited by a limit that Jimmy DeMare presents, and as the head of the real estate exposure for the whole company from the line side and supported by the team on the risk side. So it's just – 30 years I've been around this business, you just see the granular – well, we used to say, what do we have and people have to run out and look? Now, you have it and then you can manage a lot more effectively on a go-forward basis. Very good. And then pivoting a bit, you touched on it in your prepared remarks about the regional bankers that you guys have been hiring here in the states. Tom talked about it at a conference recently. You had good numbers in your investment banking area this quarter and are taking some wallet share. Is it because of hires that you're making across the globe, or is it because some of your competitors are still struggling to really get back into the old groove of what they were let's say 10 or 12 years ago? Yeah. I think that Matthew Koder and the team have realized we had the capabilities of franchise tools. We just needed to really drive the calling effort. And he's done a great job of doing that. Alastair Borthwick and Matthew together have been working on building out this Middle Market team which is good. It's not only just pure investment banking, everything is M&A or maybe debt capital markets, it also – the exposure plays a lot into the Markets business, hedging fuel cost or hedging interest rate risk or currency risk. The average midsized US company is engaging all over the world, and that's a competitive advantage only a few of us have is to be able to deliver in India for a midsized company in the United States and help them think through that or other places. So I think the team has done a good job there. We work very closely with the Wealth Management team in terms of referrals and coverage of the Entrepreneur segment, thinking of a private banker, a financial advisor in Merrill Lynch and their clients, working with the commercial. We measure that, we goal it. It has to come sort of naturally by money in motion or transactional activity. But the awareness, the capabilities and the coverage, they've done a good job. And so we will always be susceptible to the biggest deals that activity slows down, all of us have that issue. But that underlying Middle Market is just a lot more companies, 10,000, 5,000 companies that you can – that there's just a lot higher probability of one of them doing something on a given day than the top thousand companies. Very good. And thank you and I look forward to seeing you in three weeks. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Gerard. And there are no further questions at this time. So I'll turn it back to Brian. Thank you very much for your time and attention and thank you for attending our earnings call. I think the themes for this call, and you heard them in the Q&A and the earlier presentations, are the years of investments that the team has made and managed are paying off. We're using loans – our loan and deposit growth above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes, which all of you are focused on and should be. We still continue to make sure we stay dedicated to responsible growth to make sure the credit risk and market risk we take on is consistent with how you expect us to manage it. And we continue to manage investments and expenses and run that sort of dual brain side of saying we can grow our investments and we can also continue to manage our expenses carefully and relatively flat. And then on top of all that, over the last few years, our ability to have sustainable predictable earnings and the excess capital is coming back to you along with 100% of the earnings at levels which are unprecedented among our peers. So that's helping drive down the share count and helping produce EPS growth that we need. So consistent with responsible growth. And we look forward to seeing you next time. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning and welcome to the First Horizon National Corp. Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aarti Bowman of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Allie. Please note that the earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation we'll use in this call are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.firsthorizon.com. In this call, we will mention forward-looking and non-GAAP information. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking information for a number of reasons outlined in our earnings materials and our most recent annual and quarterly report. Our forward-looking statements reflect our views today and we are not obligated to update them. The non-GAAP information is identified as such in our earnings materials and in the slide presentation for this call and is reconciled to GAAP information in those materials. Also, please note that this webcast on our website is the only authorized record of this call. This morning's speakers include our CEO, Bryan Jordan; and our CFO, BJ Losch. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer, Susan Springfield, will be available with Bryan and BJ for questions. I'll now turn it over to Bryan. Thank you, Aarti. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'm pleased with our third quarter strong financial results. We showed good balance sheet trends, improved efficiency and remained disciplined with expenses. The third quarter demonstrated that our countercyclical business mix helps us produce good returns even in a challenging interest rate environment. Fixed income revenue was up 66% from last year helped by lower rates and greater market volatility. Average daily revenue increased to nearly $1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Our mortgage warehouse business was also helped by lower rates, with loans to mortgage companies up 84% year-over-year. Our results show that we're delivering on the key strategic priorities outlined at our Investor Day last year. We're strengthening our dominant position while profitably growing our new markets in specialty businesses in Tennessee. In the third quarter, we saw good balance sheet momentum across our markets, with average loans up 10% year-over-year. We're also improving our funding mix, growing customer deposits to replace wholesale funding. I'm particularly pleased with the customer deposit growth in our key markets. In the third quarter, we showed solid revenue growth and controlled our costs, resulting in an improved efficiency ratio on an adjusted basis. Our cost saves are enabling us to reinvest into the company with better products and better technology for our customers. The current operating environment has slowed somewhat, but our markets across the Southeast remained good economically. Overall, our customers are in good financial position and they remain reasonably positive about the economy and growth prospects. Over the past 12 to 18 months since completing the integration of the Capital Bank merger, we've focused on growing our businesses. We've executed on the opportunities that are attractive markets offer. At the same time, we've been implementing plans and making investments that better position us to provide products and services in an increasingly cost effective and convenient way. Our actions have enabled us to deliver solid improvement in our earnings power this year and positioned us for the long term. I'll now turn the call over to BJ to go through the quarter and then I'll be back for some closing comments. BJ? Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on slide 6 with our financial results, which demonstrate continued execution on our key priorities laid out at our Investor Day last November and strong growth momentum from our newer markets we entered with our Capital Bank merger. We had another very good earnings quarter in 3Q 2019, $0.35 on a reported basis and $0.43 adjusted for notable items. We saw strong revenue growth, up 2% linked quarter, driven by fee income in both our fixed income and banking businesses. FTN, in particular, continued its strong 2019 performance with just under $1 million of average daily revenues in the quarter. We saw very strong broad-based loan growth in both our markets and our specialty businesses with overall loans up 5% linked quarter. We saw healthy core deposit growth with strength in key markets such as Middle Tennessee, South Florida and the Carolinas. These strong customer flows enabled the continued positive mix shift in the deposit base. And this customer growth coupled with good pricing discipline allowed us to both grow customer deposits and lower our deposit rate paid by 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Strong loan growth and deposit pricing discipline helped to mitigate continued macro interest rate pressures as well as lower accretion, resulting in only a modest $3 million decline in net interest income through the quarter. Expense control remains a key focus and we delivered another good quarter-on-quarter expenses with efficiencies offsetting reinvestment in the business and higher variable compensation supporting the strong revenue growth in our fixed income business. Total expenses were up 2% due to some notable items that we've listed out on the bottom right of the slide. The primary drivers were restructuring expenses related to our efficiency actions, resolutions of legal matters and some acquisition-related charges primarily related to legacy legal and employment agreement matters along with fixed asset impairments. Other than rebranding, which we'll officially roll out in late October, we would expect a much lower impact for notable items in the fourth quarter. Turning to loan growth on slide 7, you can see that after the Capital Bank systems conversion mid last year, we've seen materially improved balance sheet momentum. Total loan growth stands at 10% year-over-year, much higher than the 3% to 6% growth we discussed at Investor Day last November. And the growth has been in the key markets and specialty businesses that are our most profitable segments and the ones that we are very focused on growing. Looking at the loan growth in more detail on slide 8, you can see that our strategic focus on growing those areas have clearly paid off. Linked quarter specialty loans grew 11% and were up 23% year-over-year. As expected, loans to mortgage companies delivered more strong growth with linked quarter increases of 32% and year-over-year increase of 84%. Bryan mentioned earlier the business offers countercyclical benefits since lower rates help drive volume. And while refinancings were higher in the third quarter, the purchase market remains very strong as well. In fact, purchase volume outpaced refi volume with the purchase refi mix at 56%, 44% respectively. We continue to grow market share and maintain competitive pricing through our ability to provide balance sheet capacity, expert knowledge, and flexibility to our customers. As you can see in the bottom left of the slide, not only did loans to mortgage companies grow in the specialty businesses area, but all other lines of businesses also grew linked quarter as well. Specialty loan growth in aggregate, excluding loans to mortgage companies, was up 4% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year. And our key markets, Middle Tennessee, South Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas, delivered a solid growth as well at just under 2% linked quarter with a 7% increase year-over-year. Shifting to deposits on slide 9, you can see our continued emphasis on growing customer deposits resulted in a solid deposit growth across key markets and specialty areas. If you look at the bottom of the slide, we've seen excellent deposit growth across all areas; 21% deposit growth year-over-year in specialty businesses; 10% growth in key markets; and a very healthy 6% year-over-year in Tennessee. In the key markets, in particular, our focus on South Florida is paying off with a 16% growth; Middle Tennessee, growing double digits; and our Mid-Atlantic market, primarily in the Carolinas, growing 8%. Non-interest-bearing deposits were also up 4% linked quarter due to a consistent dedicated focus on building primary relationships across our consumer and commercial customer bases. By continuing to shift our deposit mix and manage our deposit rates appropriately, we saw another decline in our deposit costs, which were down another 3 basis points this quarter. Turning to slide 10, if we look at NII and the margin, we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet to optimize both NII and NIM drivers in various rate environments. And as you can see, our core net interest income was up due to strong commercial loan growth as well as lower deposit costs. The overall NII and NIM decreases were largely due to a large step down in accretion as well as the impact of declining LIBOR rates. While the lower rate environment is affecting our NII and NIM like others across the industry, our unique business mix is providing the expected countercyclical offset that others in the industry do not possess that help support our overall earnings. Within the net interest income line, our loans to mortgage company business benefits from falling rates through higher volume. And then, our fee income businesses could benefit from lower rates specifically our fixed income and derivatives businesses, we saw strong performance. Moving to slide 11, we see some of the key drivers of another great quarter for fixed income. Linked-quarter again, average daily revenue was about $1 million a day, up 15% from last quarter and up 83% year-over-year. The decline in interest rates, the sentiment towards continued lower rates, and market volatility all favorably impacted activity in the quarter. Other product revenue increased as well with customers continuing to execute rate swaps, resulting in higher fees in our derivatives business. And in addition, we are very pleased that the hard work that Mike Kisber and his team at FTN have done to reduce fixed cost over the last few years have improved our profit margins on incremental revenue growth from prior levels. Based on the key drivers of revenues in fixed income, we expect earnings in the business to continue its strength in the current market conditions. Turning to expenses on slide 12, you see that our strategic focus on optimizing our expense base to both improved efficiency and enabled incremental investment is paying off. We've demonstrated disciplined expense management on a core basis year-to-date. And in addition to benefiting from capturing the full year benefit of merger cost saves in 2019, we've taken additional actions across the franchise this year to achieve approximately $80 million of incremental efficiencies with about $15 million reinvestment. We've reduced structural cost meaningfully by rightsizing our spend across all areas of our business, rethinking how we deliver services to our customers based on what they want, and improving processes to take out unnecessary cost. With the $80 million of cost reduction and avoidance we'll achieve this year, we will have saved about 7% of our gross expense base while starting to invest a meaningful amount in growth markets such as South Florida as well as needed areas such as technology, digital banking, customer experience, and treasury management. Turning to asset quality on the next slide, loan loss provision remained relatively stable linked-quarter. The regional bank provision was up through to strong commercial loan growth and modest grade migration offset by continued net reserve releases in the nonstrategic portfolio. The linked-quarter uptick in net charge-offs which related to two commercial credits, and we're still seeing overall credit stability in our portfolios with charge-offs still at historic lows and credit quality remaining strong. To sum up, we're controlling what we can control and delivering on the key priorities we laid out last November at our Investor Day. We have a strong balance sheet momentum with good loan and deposit growth in key markets and specialty areas. We're implementing cost savings to reinvest into the company to further enhance our earnings power. Credit quality is stable. We're deploying capital smartly. And our countercyclical businesses such as fixed income and loans to mortgage companies are providing the unique offsets that we expected in a declining rate environment. Wrapping up with the outlook slide on slide 15, you'll see that our outlook for the year for return on tangible common equity, efficiency ratio and credit quality remain unchanged. However, we've increased our ROA outlook to reflect strong revenues on higher fee income coupled with the ongoing expense discipline. As have others in the industry, we've lowered our NIM outlook for the full year due to earlier Fed rate cuts than previously expected, as well as our updated expectation of two additional Fed rate cuts this year and subsequent further declines in LIBOR. Again, the impact with NIM will be somewhat offset with loan growth that is likely to exceed our prior outlook of 3% to 6% for the year as well as the countercyclical offsets in our fixed income business. Due to our strong organic loan growth opportunities, we've been able to put more capital to work in an accretive fashion and we expect CET1 levels to be in the 9% and 9.5% range for the year. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan and he can make some closing comments. Thank you, BJ. We feel very good about our outlook for the remainder of the year and we're very encouraged by the momentum we see in the fourth quarter and going into the turn of 2020. The economies across our footprint continue to be good. Our customers are generally optimistic and we're well-positioned to continue growing our balance sheet, improving profitability and controlling expenses. Thank you to all of our colleagues for all of their hard work in the quarter, building our business and serving our customers. With that, Allie, we'll take now some questions. Great. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Hey, good morning, everybody. Good morning, Steve. Hey, Steve. I'd like to start on the NIM guidance. So, if I look at the 3.25%, the new estimate of full-year 2019, it implies a fairly sharp drop coming here in 4Q, maybe 7-basis-point range or so. BJ, is there another large step-down in accretion coming in 4Q, or is this margin pressure from the assumption that we get to two rate cuts in the quarter? Hey, Steve, good question. So, you can see from second quarter to third quarter, we had a fairly large step-down in the loan accretion from about $12 million in second quarter down to about $6 million in the third. I wouldn't expect that big of a step-down in the fourth. It'll probably continue to come down modestly, but this was quite a big step-down. I think it's more related to our now-current assumption for two additional Fed rate cuts in the fourth quarter. As you know, Fed fund futures have been moving all over the place, but as of this morning, the futures actually imply only one rate cut, the rest of this year in October, and then not another one until August of next year. But to be more on the conservative side, we're assuming two rate cuts. And so, we would continue to assume that there will be further pressure on the margin in the fourth quarter. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the fixed income business, if I look at the $1 million ADR, nice to see it back to the low-end of the historical range, market volatility was really high in August. Is this where you saw the bigger pickup in volumes, or the short-term rates just moved lower? Are you just seeing a sustained increase overall of trading volumes? I would actually say it was pretty consistent. If you look at month-to-month-to-month for the quarter, I think, July was just under $1 million, August was right around $1 million, and September was slightly above $1 million. And so, it was fairly consistent. But the interesting thing to see was the number of days that we had above $1 million was about 42% of trading days in the quarter above $1 million. 75% of trading days were actually above $750,000. So, we had very consistent volume throughout the quarter in terms of what we were seeing. So that gives us a lot of encouragement that going forward, at least in these current market conditions, this kind of performance can continue for FTN. Okay. That's helpful. And just finally, BJ, on CECL, what's the anticipated impact day one and how do you think about ongoing provision impacts from CECL? Thanks. Sure. So, we haven't yet disclosed our impacts for CECL. We'll probably do that with our fourth quarter earnings announcements. But we have done a significant amount of work, of course, as you can imagine. And so, we expect much like the industry to see more of an impact on the longer-dated assets, more on the consumer portfolios, less of an impact on the commercial portfolios. So, we will generally, I believe, be in line with what we're seeing across the industry, but we'll disclose that upcoming in the fourth quarter. Okay. Terrific. Thanks for all the color. Sure. Next we have Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Good morning, guys. Good morning. Good morning. I guess, BJ, if you could help clarify around the efficiency plan, so you expect $65 million of net savings through the restructuring, rebranding, all of that that's going on. When we look at the $276 million expense run rate for the third quarter, how much of that is baked in? How much of that comes through in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to think to as we look into next year where – how we should think about just core expenses ex any capital markets volatility? Yeah. So, if you look across – if you look at slide 12, that kind of gives you a pretty good view of the relative stability quarter-to-quarter of our expenses and that's with materially growing fixed income. So, we've been taking cost out of the organization, particularly during the first half of the year, some of it being offset by variable comp with FTN. But also towards the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we are reinvesting in the business. It's not just all drop into the bottom line. And so, more of our reinvestment is hitting in the latter part of the year So, I expect the expenses to be in this range, give or take $5 million in the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing. We have very, very good expense discipline which we're proud of, but we will be reinvesting in the business as well. Understood. So the net $65 million of savings one way or the other are reflected in these numbers? Correct. Just making sure that we got that right. Understood. That's right. It's come in across the year. That's an all-in number relative to what our run-rate was at the beginning of the year. And then just tied to that, when we think about the cap markets against the efficiency ratio ex the legal was about 71%, 72%, can you give us a sense of like how we should think about operating leverage if ADRs continue to get better into next year like does it fall into the 60s or is there a natural trough in that business when you think about it? Yeah. That's a good question. If you do take out some of the legal matters and really look at both last quarter and this quarter, the business roughly has a 50% margin on the incremental revenue that we're generating right now. I alluded to in my opening comments that Mike Kisber and the team out there have done great work the last few years on taking out fixed costs and other costs that weren't supportive of revenue. That 50% used to be a 60% margin a couple of years ago. And so now, we're getting much more leverage. So, incremental 50% margin will of course help overall the 70% efficiency ratio that we see today. So as fixed income move higher, we would expect the efficiency ratio to continue to get better. That's helpful. And if I can, just one follow-up to Steve's question on the margin. I guess to be clear, you assume October and then December rate cut in the guidance, and it implied about a 3.15%, plus or minus, margin for fourth quarter. Can you talk about the outlook going forward given the dynamic of what you're seeing in terms of the product mix shift, like, is there a point where you can defend the margin despite the additional rate cuts, or do we need rate cuts to stop before the margin drops? Yeah. So, the 3.15%, plus or minus, I'd probably be a little bit more on the plus side than the minus side for that in the fourth quarter, because I think we are doing a good job defending the margin with our deposit pricing discipline. We are seeing good volume, particularly in loans to mortgage companies based on the rate environment. So, we do have pretty good offsets, but LIBOR declining and the Fed outlook certainly is a headwind. Deposit pricing dynamics are still very competitive, no doubt, but you have seen with the Fed cutting rates more and more banks, whether it's online or the traditional banks being a lot more thoughtful and a lot more disciplined around deposit pricing in general. And so, I think that's incrementally helpful and supportive of the margins, but overall declining LIBOR is going to be more of a headwind that we have to deal with, although, again, remind everybody of the unique countercyclical offsets that we have in our business, some of which are in net interest income and net interest margin like loans to mortgage companies, but others like our fixed income business and our derivatives business are going to show up more in the fee income line, such that our EPS can be potentially more supportive than, than maybe some others that are just levered to the margin. Ebrahim, This is Bryan. I'll add to BJ's comment. I think, fundamentally, when you step back from what's going on with the interest rates, there seems to be a fundamental disconnect between the expectation of lower rates and what's going on in the underlying economy. And, as I indicated lower, it clearly has slowed a little bit and, I think, some of the impact is driven by tariffs or the expectation of tariffs. And, I think, there's an awful lot of talk about lower rates and the impact. But if you look at even the dialogue at the Fed, they have a bit of a mixed discussion about whether they need to cut and whether they don't. We don't fundamentally see that rates need to go a whole lot more – go a whole lot lower based on economic activity. As BJ said, we've built in an expectation for a couple of cuts. But fundamentally, the business underlying our markets is still very good. Consumers are good. Borrowers are good. Borrowers are confident. And, generally speaking, we see a lot of momentum in our footprint. And so, while we think that, like everybody else, we're going to see a negative impact if the Fed cuts rates on our margin, we do think there's a lot of underlying momentum in the business lending and customer activity. And then, as BJ said, we have a bit of a countercyclical balance that that helps us overcome some of that. So, we, we look at these rate cuts and see them as a headwind, but we're still very optimistic about our outlook. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Morning, Ken. Obviously, your loan growth just is awesome this quarter and I was a bit – I was hoping to get a little clarity. When you think about 2020, obviously, loans to mortgage company is very strong. I mean, is that something that can continue into 2020? I mean, I guess, sort of two questions: one of them, the loans to mortgage side and then the other one just kind given that economic uncertainty. I mean, I think you just spoke very positively about the healthy borrowers and what they're seeing. So, I guess it implies that you do see some of that strength continuing but it just seems like it's a tough pace to continue. Yeah. I'll start and then let Susan pick up. Ken, I think that the loans to mortgage company is going to depend on for the next couple of quarters what refi activity looks like and there's still a huge number of potential refi opportunities out there with the way the 10-year has dropped and to the extent that mortgage originators lower rates as volumes start to subside a little bit, I think it can make it steady. We would acknowledge very readily that that is a bit of a cyclical business and that at some point those balances will trend down. But I do think fundamentally in our warehouse business, our team has done a really an outstanding job of building market share and building a very strong business. So, I think we've improved share. I think we'll run at higher balances. But I'm still optimistic about the opportunity to grow loans in our existing footprint on a broader basis. You see in the data, we had good growth in our specialty businesses. South Florida, our Florida region, what's going on in middle Tennessee, mid-Atlantic are still very, very good economies, and we see good opportunities there. There's one point in there that sort of underscores my next point, which is if you look at our Commercial Real Estate business, it was down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. So, we look at the opportunity to grow the balance sheet in a very disciplined thing. We think it's important that we not stretch our credit standards, that we not take undue credit risk to grow the balance sheet. So, we're going to continue to try to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. But, at the same time, we're going to continue to be very disciplined in the way we use our balance sheet and make sure that we're keeping a good credit structure, and we're keeping a strong pricing discipline as we as we look at opportunities. Susan? Yeah. For the mortgage warehouse business, we've added 49 clients over the last two years to the client count mortgage warehouse. And so, being able to continue to expand that market share has been important for us as we think about growing that business. We've also had great opportunities over the last couple of quarters with rates doing what they're doing to expand existing relationships too. In addition to that, the mortgage warehouse team has added some very talented relationship managers from other entities who have relationships. I was recently on a call, and we were able to bring in a client that we've actually been calling on for several years. And because of the RM that we hired, they finally decided to come on over. So,  (00:31:16) that business will continue to be good. As Bryan mentioned, rates to do impact it but I feel good about the fact that we've expanded market share with new clients as well as with existing clients. And then to add onto what Bryan said more broadly outside of mortgage warehouse, we do believe there are opportunities to continue to grow and I am pleased with the discipline that I see. We have monthly calls with lines and with credit leaders and we talk about business they're winning and business they're choosing not to compete on. And I think that's very important if we continue to build the balance sheet for the long term. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just my second question, in terms of deposit costs, so I think your core deposit was down by 3 basis points this quarter. When you think about your NIM guidance for fourth quarter, how much of that is dependent on a sort of set assumption about what your deposit costs are? And I guess what I'm asking is how much visibility do you have in those deposit costs currently in terms of what you know is rolling off, in terms of pricing given the October rate cut versus how much more variability could there be if the industry is less aggressive on deposit pricing? Yeah. So I think and we have very good visibility into deposit costs. We know obviously exactly what we are offering from a base rate, from a promo perspective, what vintages are, what's rolling off, what our rate guarantees are, et cetera. So we've seen two quarters now of step downs on deposit pricing as the Fed has cut rates. We would expect to be similarly disciplined in the fourth quarter if they continue to cut rates. We've done a very good job on the commercial side moving those rates down. I would expect that to continue. And I think we can do a good job, maybe even a little better job on the consumer deposit side managing rate. So I feel very, very good about our deposit discipline in the face of continuing to grow deposits in a reasonable fashion, particularly in those key markets. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, John. So, back to the loan growth question, and I appreciate the color around both the warehouse, as well as the other businesses and how it's holding up. I know more broadly you're looking at the loan growth coming in above your 3% to 6% level for 2019. For 2020, factoring in the mortgage warehouse, is it still fair to assume a mid-single-digit range, and then – or is it something that could be close to the low-single digits just given later cycle in some of the macro backdrop indicators that we're seeing? Thanks. Yes. So, John, I think, like we talked about, we continue to see strength in the fourth quarter continuing into next year. Right now, we are in the midst of our strategy planning which we do with the management team and the board at this time every year. And so, we actually have pretty good visibility into what the execution plans are for next year across the businesses. And like Bryan and Susan said earlier, sentiment is pretty good. We know where we want to focus, which is key markets and specialty businesses. We understand where the niche opportunities are. And so, we expect to be able to continue to grow. Now, can we do 10% year-over-year every year? That's difficult, but I think that we can continue to sustain some of the momentum that we've seen the last couple quarters for quite some time. Clearly, the toggle is going to be loans to mortgage companies which, for the foreseeable future and with rates doing what they're doing with refi volumes, how they're acting, we think that that can have continued strength, at least for the next couple of quarters. So, we feel very good about our loan growth prospects. Okay. And then, on that same topic, outside of the warehouse, are you seeing any impact to borrower sentiment? If we look at the ISM data, we're seeing some softness there and some CapEx pullback. Any indication that you're seeing that yet? We've really – we've kind of had a couple of customers that were impacted by tariffs and, so obviously, their sentiment is not real good due to the impact on their business, not just particularly on a couple of clients that we've talked to. Sentiment and, I think, Bryan said this earlier, sentiment is still good and people are cautiously optimistic at this point. So, I don't think I'm necessarily – not necessarily exuberant, but optimistic, and they're talking with our bankers about opportunities to acquire companies, building these facilities, investment in equipment. So, there's still opportunities for our clients to grow. John, this is Bryan. Okay. I would add to what Susan said that there are a very few customer meetings that don't some way come up – tariffs don't some way come up and, whether that impacts their business or not, it does come up. So, it is affecting sentiment to some extent because people are talking about it. If you look at borrower financial statements, balance sheets, they continue to be very good. And, as Susan said, while that they're competing for labor at higher rates or higher costs they still are fairly optimistic. And so I'd say on the whole, look, it's not without some headwinds, and then tariffs do come up and higher cost particularly around labor affect people, but generally speaking people are still pretty positive right now. Okay. Great. And if I could just ask one more follow-up. On the credit front, can you just give us a little bit more color on those two commercial credits that drove the higher charge-offs? And then I know that your nonaccruals came down, but can you give us a little more color around what happened in criticized assets for the quarter and maybe delinquencies more broadly? Thanks. Sure. So, on the two credits where we had a charge-off, one was an energy credit and they did not – really the drivers of that were two things. They had inadequate production and they were not able to successfully complete an equity raise. So, we did take a charge this quarter on that credit. The other was a healthcare credit that owns and operates specialty – a surgical hospital, the ambulatory surgery centers, and their real issue had to do with they were bringing their accounts receivable collection in-house and were very delayed in getting billing out, and you may know medical receivables become difficult to collect the longer they go out, and they also had some acquisitions. So, we took a charge on that credit as well. As it relates to our just general outlook, again, we've had a couple of downgrades with two companies related – lumber companies that have some tariff issues. We've had a restaurant that had some reputational risk franchise issue. So, all of these are specific to those credits, so I'm really not seeing anything broadly. As it relates to criticized balances, they were up about $70 million quarter over quarter. But they're at the same level at this point that they were at fourth quarter of 2018. So, it's really not elevated. As you know, there's going to be some lumpiness from time to time. And then non-performing loans did come down. That was specifically related to the mortgage warehouse client that we identified last quarter. We were actually able to successfully move that into held for sale. We also took a charge reversal on that mortgage warehouse client this quarter. Last quarter, we charged off $4 million and look to recovery this quarter of $2.5 million on that mortgage warehouse client. So, feel good about that. And then lastly, you mentioned delinquencies. Delinquencies were really stable across the book with the exception of you probably saw a little elevation in C&I, I think $22 million for the quarter. $6 million of that has already been resolved and we're also expecting – I'm actually expecting roughly $9 million payoff to come in this week. So that $9 million was really the driver of the elevation in the delinquencies and C&I. So, overall, I feel very good about where we are as it relates to our asset quality. Our next question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning. Good morning, Brady. So, another great quarter in the mortgage warehouse. So, I was wondering, the yield of the mortgage warehouse, I think it was around 5.5% last quarter. With the pickup in volumes, I was wondering if there was any large change in that mortgage warehouse yield quarter over quarter? Yeah. So, it is based on one month LIBOR. So, with one month LIBOR coming down, the yield came down so that the yields are roughly around 5.30% now versus the 5.50% last quarter. What I would tell you is very interesting is as we've gotten more volume this quarter we've actually gained a bit more pricing power as well particularly towards the end of the quarter. What we saw across the industry and some of the market participants were actually backing away from some volume and having some capacity constraints. We were able to step in and serve those clients very well. And so, we saw a significant increase obviously in our volumes, as well as our pricing holding up pretty well. So, again, as Bryan and Susan have said, this business is incredibly well-managed. We have very little customers. We're gaining them every day. And so, we're very bullish on the prospects of this over time. We've also had – the yield was also slightly impacted by average dwell time went up two days quarter over quarter and because of the way we do book fees on those with a slight impact on yield due to just a massive volume in the whole system that really is what led to a slightly increase dwell time. All right. That's helpful. And then, one more on expenses, I mean you talk about kind of the net $65 million taken out. I mean, I think if I look at that slide last quarter, it was a net $30 million so you'll – that number continues to go up. But longer-term as you look out the next couple of years, is there more opportunity to continue to get efficiencies, or are you close to the level where operating leverage just won't be as great as it has been the last couple of years for you guys? Brady, this is Bryan. As we look out, we think there are two compelling things on the expense side that we've got to keep both focused on. And one is making the right investments in our business on products and services, and the other is paying for it by driving efficiency in our existing operations. And so, as BJ said earlier, we have demonstrated over many years that we have the ability to continue to think about our business and drive efficiency in the way we operate. You may or may not have noted, in the last couple of weeks, we closed another 20 or so – 22 branches. So, we're constantly trying to make sure that we're providing high levels of service and customer experience and doing it with the most efficient infrastructure we can. And so, while I don't know what the demand for investment will be, we think that we've got the opportunity to pay for a substantial, if not all of that – substantial portion, if not all of that, by continuing to think about how we reposition our infrastructure and use technology to get more efficient for the long term. Got it. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Good morning. Hey, Marty. Hey, Marty. As I always do, I have more of a layered question that I want to kind of walk through. Going into the year, First Horizon was really well positioned. You're kind of at a seasonal low with mortgage companies. Fixed income was at its kind of cyclical low. So, those are kind of deltas that can kind of kick in, which we've seen over the last two quarters which should have been expected given what you saw with the interest rates and then the seasonality in mortgage company. That's generated about $0.08 of growth from the first quarter to where we're at now in the third quarter out of about the $0.09. Now, some of that has been offset by loan loss allowance that's been ticking up as well. So, if you net that out, let's say that's about $0.05 or $0.06 out of the $0.09. So, my thing now is as we kind of go through this inflection point and we look at the seasonality of mortgage, now you still have the refis that could take a couple of quarters to burn out. But if you kind of go through that next dip, you kind of see that seasonality. If you look at what's happening in fixed income as much as you had rates down, we still have on the back end of your little table there, yield curves are going to be flat to inverted. The economy is still relatively positive given all the loan growth that you've talked about. So, those things are really negative. And the positives I think are more related to cash flow. In other words, rates came down on mortgage, prepayments have kicked up, and so cash flow is creating some of this temporary uptick in the fixed income side. So, if the allowance – my three questions are really, if you look at the mortgage company seasonality, that's kind of a headwind. If you think about sustainability of fixed income, that looks like an incremental headwind as we go forward. And then lastly, when we look at the allowance, have we kind of gotten to a new level or this is just elevated because of what we have with the two credits that we charged off this particular quarter? So just trying to get the level of those three things because that really was the dynamic that we went through in the last two quarters. So there's a lot there, Marty. I know it. I know it. Sorry. So I guess I'll start on the mortgage company in FTN and maybe Susan can give her views on loan loss provision. But I think on the two countercyclical offsets which we've said before, yes, they are up because sentiment and the rate environment are down. If the reverse had happened, maybe they wouldn't have been as strong but our margins would have been better and we would have gotten more incremental income from some of the great loan growth that we've seen. So I kind of see them as counterbalances to continue to help us over time in any rate environment or any economic environment continue to improve our earnings. So I don't necessarily sit here and say, well, gosh, yeah, this has been great, but it's going to be a headwind. We kind of look at the totality of our business mix, which is why we like it working together to allow us to figure out ways to continue to grow the business. And as Bryan just articulated, we are constantly trying to think ahead about how we continue to do that particularly around, let's say, expenses knowing that we have to take out more costs to be able to reinvest or any of those types of things. So we are constantly tweaking and managing to continue to grow, and we'll continue to do that the best we can. And then as it relates to the allowance, we believe we're adequately reserved. And we just – as each quarter comes, we take a look at what's going on in the book. At this point, I feel very good about our asset quality, Marty. And so, if we did have the two larger charge-offs this quarter, I'm not – I feel very good about the fourth quarter and the outlook for 2020 assuming the economic conditions remain stable. Hey, Marty, this is Bryan. The other thing that when you went through and you're sort of doing your reconciliation I didn't hear you pick up was yields on loans were down about $0.03 in the quarter just due to lower rates. And the old adage that every dark cloud has a silver lining, I'm not sure that every silver lining has a dark cloud. And I wouldn't work too hard to work out all the cyclical stuff. I mean, at the end of the day, we have a balanced business model. We understand that the mortgage business will ebb and flow. We understand that fixed income business will ebb and flow. Our outlook for today continues to be positive simply because of what we see in customer activity and what we believe about the rate environment. And so, I don't think they're – as you described, I don't think they're a headwind for 2020 as we sit here today. Yeah. My worry was just that some of these positives kind of are more temporary, whereas some of the negatives could be more permanent. So, that's what I was trying to size up, but appreciate you all's willingness to go through that. Thanks. So, are you fairly bearish on long-term rates and that they're going to be this low and go down from here? No. Well, what we generally think is that rates are going to tick down, but they're going to kind of stabilize in a range. So, there's not going to be as much volatility. So, I mean, look at your market volatility and where your  (00:51:20) moderate, I think it's going to flip back once we kind of get into a level, and it's just going to kind of be stuck in that level. So, if that kind of goes low, the yield curve is still going to be flat. If you look at the economy, it's still relatively positive, and the direction of rates kind of stabilizes. So, it's not going down anymore. It's not going up. It's not going down. So, if you have that, then you really don't have the prepayments that you got on the mortgage-backed side. And then, the refis eventually kind of burn out so that mortgage piece, while it's positive right now, it doesn't have any lasting duration to it. And then, Susan, on the credit side, the only thing that we were at last year was we still had releases of loan loss reserves. Our re-provisioning was in the, let's call it, $3 million to $6 million range. Now, we're kind of stepping up to a $10 million to $15 million range. So, you're just kind of looking at those things happening, the dropdown in rates, the net interest margin doesn't get any better, the allowance and provisioning stays higher. And then, some of these things that we've got that had been helping us over the last couple of quarters just kind of burn out over the next, let's call it, two to three quarters. So, that's the balancing act I'm trying to do as I was looking at it. Coming into the year, wow, we were positioned perfectly. I'm not sure now, with the teeter and totter of those things, how that all works out. So, that's what I was trying to size up. You must be fairly bearish on the industry as a whole because we've got these countercyclical things and, as we've acknowledged a couple of times, clearly, there is a cyclical nature. But if the consumer remains strong, rates stay strong, purchase activity and the housing finance ought to be good, I think there's a – I wouldn't be as negative as you sound like you are this morning. Well, I'm not negative. I'm trying to just balance out the things that are particular to you. So, that was really the issue just in First Horizon. And so, generally positive because I think credit costs stayed low for the duration here, so the cycle stays positive. Loan growth still stays in – what you're doing in the core bank with deposit growth and loan growth, that's generating a couple of pennies every quarter. So, you're getting that kind of progression underneath that. First Horizon, we've always had this volatility to have to deal with. I'm just trying to size up what I've experienced over the last three decades in this process. So, that's what I was trying to get at. Got you. Yeah. I think, Marty, just to add one more thing if I could. As I look at our business, we've got excellent customer activity loan growth. We've got positive deposit growth and positive mix shift into key markets. We've got really good revenue growth from fixed income and fee income in the business. We've got excellent expense discipline. So, it's hard for me to see what we're not doing right and how we're not taking advantages of the opportunities we have with our countercyclical offsets today, while also making sure we're looking to the future and making sure that we can continue to put up solid earnings numbers and returns. The two things that I heard that I think are helpful in the sense of what I was trying to be more constructive on is the fact when Susan said you added more mortgage lenders, so that's a part of the core business growth. If you look at the expense when you're coming through the restructurings so you should get some more expense savings. So, there's probably some levers that you got on the back side to help compensate for maybe some of this burn out that I was kind of anticipating. We're optimistic about it. Good discussion. Thank you. Our next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. I wanted to touch on Capital. I saw you guys taking down the CET1 ratio. You're at the floor now. Can you just give us some updated thoughts on buyback appetite here because it does sound like you have decent loan growth on the comp still? And then if we layer in sort of an industry average, CECL hit, you could go below that 9% level. Just trying to get your updated thoughts on what the buyback appetite is? Yeah. Hey, Casey. So, as you obviously know, CET1 denominator is period-end assets and we saw a significant run up in the last week of the month in our loans to mortgage company business. So, I would have expected a week before the end of the quarter that our CET1 would have been probably 30 basis points higher and the period-end assets ran up so much and brought it down to 9%. And that's exactly why we have the capital levels that we do to allow us to take advantage of organic growth opportunities like that. So, we did repurchase about $30 million of shares in the quarter which we felt really good about. We'll continue to try to be opportunistic with share repurchases if we can but always our first priority is to support customer growth and loan growth. And so based on what we've talked about today, we still feel good about our loan prospects going into the fourth quarter. So that will be our primary way. We'll put capital to work and if there's any excess that we feel is there, we'll put it to work in a different fashion. But right now, we're probably are in that the 9% to 9.5% range in the fourth quarter and feel really good about that. Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up on the mortgage warehouse yield, it sounds like it's still a accretive to your loan yield. So if it's dilutive to your NIM as you guys point out on slide 12, is that has to do with more I guess the funding side of that growth? Yeah. I mean just the easiest way to think about it is the loan yield that we talked about, the $530 million funded at, let's call it, one-month LIBOR since it has such short duration. And so, if you do that math, it's just right on or slightly below our margin and that's how we calculate it for the  waterfall. (00:58:10) Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Bank. Hey, guys. It's actually  Steve (00:58:21), on for Jennifer. Hey. Good morning. Hi,  Steve (00:58:24). Good morning,  Steve (00:58:25). Hi. So I just wanted to kind of check up on your Nashville progress. How are loans and deposits growing there? Do you guys have any goals for growing it further? Yeah. This is Bryan. We had very good growth in Middle Tennessee. It's one of those handful of markets that we continue to emphasize. I mentioned a couple of others earlier, our Florida region, mid-Atlantic,  (00:58:56) our Houston market, we still see good growth opportunities in all of those. The Middle Tennessee has been a tremendous growth engine for the economy and on the State of Tennessee as a whole. And we have been very successful in seeing good strong customer acquisition and customer growth there. And the team that we have in place led by Carol Yochem is doing a fantastic job. It's commercial. It's business banking. We're doing a really good job in the private client space. Our music industry business continues to be good. So, we're very optimistic about the ability to continue our Middle Tennessee growth, as well as some of these other markets, and we think that's going to be a bright spot for quite a while. Perfect. And just a little bit on kind of merger interest, I mean, are you guys talking at all? I know you probably may not have the multiple to do something big, but just kind of wondering what you're thinking there. Well, look, we can't ever comment on specifics. And as BJ pointed out earlier, we have a capital base, we have capital generation, and we look at it in three buckets and those three buckets are very simply supporting customer growth and customer activity which has continued to be very strong, putting it to work in an M&A context or repatriating it to the shareholders. And over the last several quarters, we've seen strong balance sheet growth and we've seen the ability to buy back some stock. So, we'll continue to evaluate all those opportunities and try to be smart about how we manage capital. Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Hey. Good morning. I want to go back to the margin discussion on slide 10. If the world gets a little more bearish than the 50 basis points down that you have here, would the beta be better necessarily and then would the momentum that you have in the other businesses continue do you think in the next year? Hey, Chris. So, I think if there are multiple rate cuts beyond, let's say, the 50 basis points, I do think, in my opinion, that banks would get a bit more aggressive even more so than they have been on managing deposit pricing because of what the yield curve looks like and short and long-term rates. So, yes, I think there would be further opportunity beyond the 50 basis points. It's very interesting, I know you look at it as well, but Fed fund futures have been all over the map, and I've heard all kinds of sentiment about, well, it's going to be 100 basis points of reductions from here over the next four quarters. Like I said earlier, futures as of today would only imply one cut in October and not another one till August next year. So, it's hard to tell. We are trying to manage the balance sheet as well as we possibly can to mitigate those things, and the way we're doing it is strong healthy loan growth, managing pricing discipline, and deposit mix as well as we possibly can, and using those countercyclical businesses to provide offsets that we can as well. So, we'll see how it works but we like how we are positioned. Great. That's helpful. Then, just a quick follow-up. On the fixed income business, are we best to look at operating leverage year over year and not look at just what happened last quarter? Just you seem to have had good operating leverage, looking at it from a year ago. Yeah. So, Chris, like I mentioned earlier, I think a pretty good rule of thumb, generally speaking, is probably a 50% margin on incremental revenue in the business right now. Again, the team out there has done a great job of eliminating as much cost that wasn't customer-enabling as possible, so 50-basis-point margin would probably be a good way to look at it. Our next question comes from Garrett Holland with Baird. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. First, maybe on the securities portfolio. It's trending a bit lower in recent quarters, which makes sense given the strong loan growth. But where do you expect that portfolio to stabilize, and where are the new money yields for securities as the yield is coming a bit, too? Yeah. So, it was down, I don't know, $100 million this quarter. It's based, as you said, on what we're seeing in terms of loan demand, so we'd much rather put money to work on the loan side. We expect loan growth to continue. In the securities portfolio, we've generally just been reinvesting cash flows for the most part, mostly back into mortgage-backed securities. Yields are lower, generally speaking, than what we're seeing in the aggregate portfolio right now and modestly. So, you can see, if you look at our financial supplement in the yields and rates section, you can see what the yields are doing, and they've been modestly coming down, as you might imagine, with the yield curve. So, I don't see a material impact nor a change in our strategy to manage the securities portfolio, it'll just be based on how much loan demand we have and what kind of reinvestments we have. That's helpful. And I wanted to get your thoughts on deposit mix going forward, specifically market index deposits and the relative attractiveness of those funds as rates do move lower? Yeah. So, interestingly, they were clearly a headwind as rates were going up. They are a tailwind in terms of deposit cost as they come down. Long-term, we want customer deposits versus market index deposits. So, we will continue to manage those down as we continue to build customer deposits. You saw in this quarter though they were actually up and that's because we saw excess cash coming from the brokerage firms that we do have contracts with sending more money into our facilities. So that happens and it helps to fund our loan growth at lower costs. So that was helpful to us. The long-term, we'll continue to try to manage it down from these levels. Our last question today comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. Good morning. This is actually Timur Braziler, filling in for Jared. Just one more for me. Bryan, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the operating environment has slowed somewhat. Can you just frame that comment? Are you seeing that on the commercial side kind of ex the mortgage warehouse business? Are utilization rates down? If you can provide any additional color on that comment, that would be great. Yes. It's really just a sense of talking to customers and our bankers talking to customers, and so it's not a scientific measure. It's sort of is consistent with job growth which is by historical standard is good. It's not as great as it was. You see expectations around the economy and GDP growth falling and that's consistent with the dialogue that we're having with our customers. As I said and I would acknowledge that some of it may be a geographic in where we do business. The Southeast is still relatively strong in my sense and we don't see or hear anything from customers that that is as negative as what you would read in the ISM either services or industrial. But we do think it has slowed a little bit. That said, against the backdrop, as we pointed out, customer balance sheet continue to be strong and they continue to be forward leaning. So, all in all, we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to grow in a somewhat slower growth economy. And look, at the end of the day, if we're down from 3% to 2%, that's still not a bad place relative to where we've been for the last 10 or 12 years. We're still fairly optimistic. I would just add, just look at our numbers and look at the broad-based growth that we're seeing. So, as Bryan said, there might be a lot of discussion and sentiment out there. But the numbers are there and we still think that the growth prospects are very strong across all of our business lines, across the key markets that we're in. We have great people and so we're optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the firm. Look, I think, at the end of the day, customers are people too whether they're consumers or whether they're running big businesses and all day long they're told that the interest rates are down, and inverted yield curve means a recession, and the politicians talk about how bad everything is and the impact of tariffs. And so, that's going to weigh on sentiment to some extent. But at this point, we don't think it's out of balance, and we don't think we've talked ourselves into a recessionary track. Not to say that we don't do that over the next several quarters, but at the end of the day, the balance sheet trends and momentum continue to be fairly good. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bryan Jordan for any closing remarks. Thank you, Allie. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and our quarter. Please let us know if you have any questions or anything that you want to further follow up on.

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q3 2019 Ally Financial Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To help reduce any background noise – I'm sorry. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Daniel Eller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, operator, and we appreciate everyone joining us to review Ally Financial's third quarter 2019 results. This morning, we have our CEO, Jeff Brown; and our CFO, Jenn LaClair, on the call to review our results and to take your questions following prepared remarks. You can find the presentation we'll reference during today's call on the Investor Relations section of our website, ally.com. I'll direct your attention to slide 2 of the presentation where we have our forward-looking statements and risk factors. The contents of today's call will be governed by this language. On slide 3, we've included some of our GAAP and non-GAAP or core measures. These and other core measures are used by management, and we believe they are useful to investors in assessing the company's operating performance and capital results. Please keep in mind these are supplemental to and not a substitute for US GAAP measures. The supplemental slides at the end include full definitions and reconciliations. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Jeff Brown. Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. On slide number 4, I'll cover highlights from third quarter. Let me begin by saying that in the midst of continued market volatility, Ally's financial results were solid again this quarter reflecting the ongoing execution of our long-term strategy. We remain pleased with performance across our auto and deposit franchises, where customer growth persisted, flows remained robust, and pricing trends were accretive to results. Progress in our Ally Home and Ally Invest offerings continued, where trends affirm, we're meeting the preferences and needs of our customers. Adjusted EPS of $1.01 increased 11% year-over-year, our highest quarterly result since going public. Core ROTCE of 12.3% remained solid. Revenues exceeded $1.6 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year while our risk profile remained steady. In auto, we originated $9.3 billion of loans and leases in the quarter, a 14% increase versus 3Q 2018 and we decisioned 3.2 million applications, despite some slowdown in new light vehicle sales, used vehicle sales remained robust. The shifting dynamic at the consumer level, our auto finance platform is well-positioned to capture, evidenced by the higher year-over-year originated volume across all of our major lending categories. Our originated yield on new retail loans was 7.51%, essentially flat year-over-year, while average benchmarks declined 135 basis points. Competition continues to ebb and flow in the space, but we remain – we see rational behavior where underwriting standards remain thoughtful and balanced overall. Within our book, trends remain steady and healthy when looking at indicators of a consumer's ability to pay, including term, FICO, LTV, DTI and PTI. We stay diligent in managing our risk profile and as you would expect have priced accordingly. With two Fed rate cuts behind us and continued easing actions forecasted, we would expect retail origination yields to trend lower over time,  (00:04:29) is well below the 100% level we observed as rates rose. Ally's scale and broad reach remains unparalleled across the industry, evidenced by our market-leading position. Over 90% of franchise dealers in the US now interact with Ally, providing us with the added benefit of real-time insights into consumer behavior and market trends. Our dealer count has consistently grown over the past five years, leading to a record 3.2 million decisioned applications in 3Q supportive of healthy volumes and continued expansion of risk adjusted returns. Credit performance remained in line with our expectations this quarter as retail auto net charge-offs of 138 basis points moved modestly higher by 6 basis points compared to the prior year. We continue to see a healthy US consumer. Jobs are prevalent, unemployment is at a 50-year low, wage growth continues to outpace inflation, and debt service levels remain well-managed. While consumer confidence recently moderated a bit, overall levels are near the highest they've been over the past two decades. Beyond the consumer, we're monitoring business and manufacturing trends, including trade developments but remain constructive on the GDP outlook, which continues to expand although at a slower pace. In our Insurance segment, written premiums were $357 million in 3Q, our highest level in five years fueled by sustained growth channel increases and ongoing expansion in our retail and wholesale product offerings. Turning to deposits, we surpassed a $100 billion in retail deposits this quarter ending the period with a $119 billion in total balances and adding 72,000 net new customers this quarter surpassing the $1.9 million mark. With another quarter to go this year, we've already exceeded full year 2018 growth in balances and customers growing by $12.2 billion and over $290,000 respectively. Over the past decade, Ally has averaged 19% annualized retail deposit growth, nearly 7.5 times the retail deposit industry growth rate. We've done this by relentlessly focusing on the customer and being true to our brand with high value, straightforward innovative digital offerings. Customer loyalty is evidenced by our strong retention levels and consistent vintage performance, which Jenn will provide more details on in a few minutes. Two-thirds of our customer balances are from mass affluent, high net worth individuals while 60% of account openings are from the millennial cohort, establishing a banking relationship with us at an early stage in their financial journey. This presents us with the opportunity to continue deepening the relationship over time. The increasing desire for convenient, seamless products and exceptional customer service go hand-in-hand with the core tenants of our philosophy. We're applying the same framework to the broadening array of consumer products we offer and look to offer in the future. Corporate Finance posted another solid quarter with HFI balances ending at $5 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year. The team remains focused on responsible growth in cultivating a diversified portfolio with compelling returns, while prioritizing credit and operational risk. Ally Home DTC originations were $800 million during the quarter, 4.5 times higher than what we originated in the prior-year period. Our partnership with Better.com has accelerated our ability to deliver a best-in-class digital experience for our customers. During the third quarter Ally Invest accounts grew 21% year-over-year ending at $346,000. In early September, we rolled out new product offerings including a managed portfolio with zero advisory fees, along with over 500 commission-free ETFs. And we recently announced commission-free trading, an industry trend we had increasingly been anticipating. Invest brings enhanced value to our customers and increases deposit stickiness. Year-to-date, around 40% of account openings have been from existing customers and retention levels for these multi-product customers is higher overall. We closed the HCS transaction earlier this month and we welcome 85 Charlotte-based teammates to Ally. We look forward to building upon momentum the team has established, leveraging the growing desire of consumers to use alternative digital payment sources in a seamless manner. And we were pleased during 3Q to receive an investment grade rating from Fitch, an acknowledgement of the significant progress we've made and the strength of our enterprise. Let's turn to slide number 5 to recap some of our quarterly metrics. Across each of the four measures shown here, we continued our strong progression in 3Q. While not always linear, the long term trend of improvement has been consistent. Adjusted EPS in the upper left of $1.01 per share increased from $0.91 a year ago. In the upper right, adjusted total net revenue increased by nearly $100 million year-over-year, while deposits grew 18% to $119 billion compared to 3Q 2018. On the bottom right, we continued building tangible book value, increasing to $34.74 per share, up 21% versus prior year. I'm confident we have the right business strategy and the right people to continue building on our momentum while remaining mindful of potential risks on the horizon. With that, I'll turn it over to Jenn to walk through the details on the quarter. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our strong results in Q3 continue to reflect the consistent progress of our business model grounded in a relentless customer focus and operating discipline. Let's begin a review of our detailed financial results on slide 6. Net financing revenue excluding OID of $1.195 billion increased $31 million linked-quarter and $67 million year-over-year. The steady expansion of NII was driven by auto optimization where portfolio yields continue to move higher and new origination pricing remains above 7.5% and the dual benefit of growing the deposit book where rates moved lower and continuing to replace higher cost wholesale funding. Despite the volatile rate environment, we expect NII to grow on a year-over-year basis over the next several quarters, though seasonality will drive some linked-quarter fluctuations, which we expect in Q4. Adjusted other revenue of $424 million grew $31 million quarter-over-quarter and $32 million year-over-year driven by solid investment gains and revenue growth from insurance. Provision expense of $263 million increased $86 million quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal seasonal trends, and $30 million year-over-year as asset levels grew and net charge-offs moved modestly higher. Auto net charge-offs increased by 6 basis points year-over-year, remaining consistent with our expectations. As we've discussed in the past, we have been originating in pricing to a 1.4% to 1.6% net charge-off range. We expect to outperform this range for full year 2019 due to strong used vehicle prices and macroeconomic factors at or near historically strong levels. We remain confident in the overall performance of the portfolio and our outlook remains the same. Losses will continue trending towards the stated range of 1.4% to 1.6% over time, which is fully accounted for in our underwriting, pricing, and collection approaches. Noninterest expense declined $43 million linked-quarter, reflecting the seasonally lower weather losses, and increased $31 million compared to the prior year. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter, something we've done every quarter this year as year-over-year revenue growth of 7% outpaced expense growth of 4%. Efficiency gains are a direct result of leveraging our scale and the investments we've made over the past few years in opportunities aligned with our long-term strategy. We expect to continue prudently investing for the future, which will result in expense growth with the parallel objective of driving improved efficiency over time. Looking at our key metrics for the quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS were $0.97 and $1.01 per share. Core ROTCE was 12.3%, including elevated OCI reflecting declining rates since year-end. Adjusted efficiency ratio of 45.3% improved 70 basis points year-over-year. Given our progress year-to-date, we remain on track to achieve the full year 2019 guidance we provided in January. This is despite the significant shift in rates and expected Q4 impacts related to the HCS acquisition of $25 million to $30 million not included in our original outlook. Turning to slide 7, I'll review balance sheet and margin. We generated revenue expansion again this quarter through a continued balance sheet growth and optimization. Like most banks, we prefer a steeper curve but we are positioned to deliver expanded net financing revenue over the near-term as we are not overly dependent on rates. Average earning assets grew 6% year-over-year primarily in capital efficient categories. We expect earning assets to modestly grow moving forward through measured auto expansion and consumer loans, ongoing diversification and capital efficient mortgage assets, prudent corporate finance growth and continued but slower investment portfolio growth as we've neared our 20% objective. On the funding side, average deposits grew nearly $18 billion year-over-year, financing earning asset growth of $10 billion, the roll-down of $2 billion in unsecured, and $9 billion lower secured funding. Net interest margin excluding OID of 2.72% increased 5 basis points linked-quarter and was essentially flat year-over-year. As we've said for some time now, we expect NIM to stay relatively stable for full-year 2019 compared to 2018. But as we move into 2020, we expect balance sheet dynamics to drive NIM expansion. The Retail Auto portfolio yield of 6.66% increased 8 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 46 basis points year-over-year resulting in another quarter of improving portfolio yield. As JB touched on earlier, we're monitoring competitive dynamics and benchmark activity but continue to expect increasing portfolio yields at around 10% of our retail auto book reprices each quarter. Keep in mind we've generated six consecutive quarters of new retail origination yields above 7%. The Lease portfolio yield was 6.24% for the quarter. Our used car index remains essentially flat year-to-date outperforming our 3% to 5% expected decline for the year. While industry off-lease volume of 4 million plus units is at the highest level in 20 years, the consumer has continued to exhibit strong demand for used vehicles. We see this as a reflection of their healthy overall financial position, improved quality and durability of used vehicles, and an increasing difference in average transaction price between new and used cars, which recently exceeded $13,000, a 50% increase versus 2011. The Commercial Auto portfolio yield declined 16 basis points linked-quarter and increased 19 basis points year-over-year. Keep in mind this is a floating rate asset that closely tracks one month LIBOR trends on a lag. On the funding side, deposits grew to 74% of overall funding while unsecured balances declined 8%. While we expect to periodically issue for parent liquidity purposes, overall balances will continue to decline as another $3 billion is scheduled to mature by the end of 2020 with an average coupon of 5.8%. On slide 8, we'll cover some deposit highlights. In the upper right, total deposits ended above $119 billion driven by retail growth of $2.7 billion while customer retention levels remained strong at 96%. Q3 marks the 39th consecutive quarter of  (00:18:56-00:19:26). Operator, are you there? Yes. We're here. Okay. We had a technical difficulty but we're going to pick up where we left off. I'll resume on slide 8 where we're covering deposits highlights. In the upper right, total deposits ended above $119 billion driven by retail growth of $2.7 billion, while customer retention levels remained strong at 96%. Q3 marked the 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage growth in our portfolio on a year-over-year basis. Year-to-date, around two thirds of balanced growth has come from new customers, while the remaining third was sourced from existing customers adding to their balances. We've seen an increasing array of competitive offerings from both traditional and emerging players in the digital space. But our customers and balances continue to demonstrate strong loyalty to Ally, reinforcing our value proposition and the long-term stability of the platform. From a flow of funds perspective, the majority of net inflows continue to come from traditional banks where there is around $4 trillion of balances earning under 50 basis points. In the bottom left, retail deposit rates declined 8 basis points linked-quarter, reflecting pricing actions over the past several months. As the Fed continues to ease, we expect the cumulative data to be higher than what we observed as rates increased a positive catalyst for the overall NIM trajectory. But our pricing decisions will remain balanced as we focus on maintaining the trust and loyalty we've earned with our customers over time. On the bottom right, we added 72,000 net new deposit customers during the period, which was our strongest third quarter and resulted in 23% year-over-year growth. The strategic value in customer and balanced growth aligns with our strategy and positions us well as we remain mindful of our 75% to 80% deposit funding target. On slide 9, we've included a chart demonstrating the stability of our deposit vintages over the past decade. Our customers consistently keep their money with us and grow their balances. Our industry-leading growth has been achieved even as we've widened the gap to top rate payers on our Online Savings product, which you can see at the bottom of the chart. And the pricing action we took last week positions us as the lowest among large direct banks, while our rate remains competitive in the broader context of the deposit industry. Let's move to capital on slide 10. CET1 of 9.6% increased linked-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting earnings growth and our disciplined approach to managing risk-weighted assets, which grew by 2% year-over-year compared to average earning asset growth of 6%. We continued repurchasing shares during the quarter, reducing shares outstanding by 20.7% since mid-2016. And we closed HCS earlier this month and expect an associated capital impact in Q4. As it pertains to CECL, we currently estimate day 1 reserves will increase by 105% to 115% driven by consumer auto. We have been proactive in planning for CECL given the phase-in to the capital position of 25% annually over the next four years. Following CECL implementation, we expect increased volatility and go-forward earnings as we move to the life-of-loan reserving and have potential fluctuations in macroeconomic assumptions. Even as this represents a material increase to our existing reserves, the underlying risk profile of our balance sheet has not changed. We plan to absorb day 1 and navigate the ongoing impacts of CECL through prudent balance sheet management while we continue to prioritize strategic capital deployment including investment and accretive growth opportunities, share buybacks and dividends. Let's turn to slide 11 to review asset quality details. Consolidated net charge-offs were 83 basis points this quarter, an increase of 8 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by retail auto. In the top right, consolidated provision expense was $263 million, an increase of $30 million compared to the prior year due to higher asset balances and moderately higher auto net charge-off. In the bottom left, the retail net charge-off rate increased 6 basis points year-over-year to 1.38% reflecting dynamics I discussed earlier. 30-plus and 50-plus delinquencies in the bottom right increased year-over-year by 26 basis points and 9 basis points respectively. The rise in delinquencies this quarter reflects the increased mix and seasoning of our Used portfolio, the purposeful change in our servicing efforts that have increased delinquencies, but consistently resulted in improved flow-to-loss trends and dynamics around closing out the quarter on a Monday, which impacts consumer payment timing. On slide 12, auto finance pre-tax income of $429 million declined $30 million linked-quarter due to seasonally higher provision and increased $46 million compared to prior year. Net financing revenue growth was driven by retail auto asset growth and increasing portfolio yield. We experienced the 22nd consecutive quarter of expanding dealer relationships in Q3 leading to our strongest third quarter ever in application volume decisioning over 3.2 million apps, an 11% year-over-year increase, which resulted in $9.3 billion in originated volume in Q3, a 14% increase versus prior year. In the bottom right, a risk adjusted return trends reflect improved new origination yields even as benchmarks have meaningfully declined. Turning to slide 13, we originated $9.3 billion of consumer loans and leases in the quarter. Growth originations of 46% declined as a percentage of our total volume in Q3 though dollar originated volume increased compared to the prior-year period. Seasonally higher new and leased volume resulted in used volume near 50% of total originations, while nonprime of 11% remained consistent. While the percent of used was lower year-over-year, the dollar amount of originations increased. In the bottom left, consumer assets grew to $81.5 billion as leased balances increased slightly and retail continued to grow. And on the bottom right, average commercial balances of $33.3 billion declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as dealer inventories normalized. On slide 14, insurance reported core pre-tax income of $66 million in the quarter, an increase of $70 million linked-quarter and $17 million versus prior year. Earned revenue increased $23 million year-over-year, reflecting the strong written premium trends over the past several quarters. We wrote $357 million of premiums in Q3, the highest level since becoming a publicly-traded company with increased volume and rate across our product offerings. And during the quarter, we were pleased to receive an upgrade to A- from AM Best, our first upgrade in 10 years at Ally Insurance. Slide 15 has our Corporate Finance segment results. Core pre-tax income of $45 million was down $2 million linked-quarter and increased $9 million year-over-year. Portfolio credit performance remained strong and in line with our expectations. Collateral-based lending increased to nearly 60% of new originations in the period, and compared to prior year Ending HFI assets grew 16%. Our origination activity reflects focus from our experienced cycle-tested teams who continue to execute through competitive environments. On slide 16, mortgage pre-tax income of $11 million was relatively flat versus prior quarter and prior year periods reflecting increased premium amortization as rates declined and prepayment activity increased. We originated nearly $800 million of direct-to-consumer loans, the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing origination volume and our highest level since launching Ally Home. We continue to see strong deposit synergies with 55% of direct-to-consumer originations sourced from existing Ally depositors. Our partnership with Better.com led to a series of best-in-class improvements, including at the fund turn times declining to approximately 30 days, and industry-leading NPS scores. The all-digital platform and streamlined customer experience will drive a 40% improvement in the cost per funded loan over time. In closing, we had another successful quarter with solid pre-tax pre-provision income growth and operating leverage gains that created ongoing progress against our 2019 full-year financial objective. These results demonstrate the strength of our core businesses and our focus on delivering for our customers and driving sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to JB. Thank you, Jen. Wrapping up on slide number 17 are the priorities for our company. The common thread running through each of these objectives is our prioritization of culture at Ally. It's how we ensure we're driving our company in the right direction. Simply put we're working to bring increased value through comprehensive and innovative consumer and commercial offerings and as established leaders in auto, insurance, and deposits we're looking to seize upon untapped opportunities that will further enhance the way we meet our customers' needs. Our 8,500 Ally associates are striving to do it right in every interaction with our customers, within the communities we serve, and on behalf of our shareholders. It has been a great three quarters of the year, and we're focused on finishing strong over the months ahead and well into the coming years. With that, we can now head into Q&A. Thanks, JB. Go ahead, operator. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Great. Thanks and congrats on really strong results. I wanted to kind of drill down a little on deposit pricing. I mean, you talked a little bit, Jenn, about being able to lead in the downward direction. And just talk a little bit about your strategies there? And how you think about that, in particular, given you've had such strong results on the asset yield side? Sure. Good morning, Moshe, and thank you. So, no changes overall to our deposit strategy, I mean as we look across the business, we're really pleased with the customer growth we're seeing, the deposit flows we're seeing. In fact through Q3, we've had the highest levels of customer and deposit growth that we've had in any full year in the history of the company, so really pleased there. And we'll continue to have strategic focus on growing customers as well as deposit. Now, relative to pricing, I mentioned we're getting close to our target funding rate of 75% to 80%. And as we do so, we do feel that we're in a really good position to continue to focus on margin and to be thoughtful as we balance competing priorities. We want to continue to grow our business. We also want to optimize the margin. We'll just be really thoughtful about that as we go forward. You've seen over the last couple of months since June, we've dropped OSA rates around 40 basis points. CDs have come down around 35 basis points. And we think that positions us exceptionally well from a financial trajectory as we go into 2020, and position ourselves for NIM expansion. And overall for the customer, relative to the – most bank rates with $4 trillion out there are getting paid under 50 basis points, we think we're really optimizing not only for Ally's margin but optimizing for the customer as well. Got you. And in a somewhat related, I mean you talked about the debt you have that comes due by the end of next year and the impact that would have at that 5.8% kind of coupon. I guess the question that I have relates to operating leverage. How does that make you kind of think about the ability to kind of continue to deliver on the operating leverage as you go through 2020? Yeah, so I mean all of this really positions us to continue to grow net interest income and NIM as we move into 2020, which is going to be a big driver around overall revenue growth and operating leverage. Relative to the unsecured debt rolling down, it's a little bit lumpy, but we've got some really high cost debt coming down in the first quarter at an 8% coupon, and so the roll down of the unsecured will just continue to lower overall deposit cost. And again, it's an input into NII and NIM trajectory. Operator, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Okay. Moshe, are you still on the line? I am. Okay. We're getting a sign of more technical difficulties. Oh, my questions have been answered, thanks. Thanks, Daniel. Okay, great. Thank you so much Moshe. Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Thanks, good morning. So, Jenn, I appreciate the commentary on CECL and sort of the related impacts. But I guess when we're thinking about EPS impacts, you mentioned the variability of volatility it'll bring. But is there any rough estimate, assuming macroeconomic conditions are stable, what the EPS impact might be? Yeah, and we'll be providing a bit more guidance as we finalize our 2020 plan. But I mean essentially when you look at day two, there is a number of drivers around that volatility. And I'll – let me just outline a couple of those. The first is if you're growing your portfolios, you're going to see an outsized increase in your reserve levels, because again you're going from a 12-month incurred loss model to life-of-loan. So, it will depend to some degree on the growth in each of your portfolios. Second, it's going to be tied to your mix, and that's the mix of your assets across your book but also just the risk content within each of those asset classes. And then last but not least, it will depend to some extent on your macroeconomic forecast. So we need to settle down our overall forecast. And when we do so, we'll provide our EPS trajectory overall for the company and give you some sensitivities around CECL. Okay, great. And I guess a follow-up related to credit quality and some of the comments you had on the delinquency rate. Obviously, you guys have had very solid performance on credit quality this year but when we look at the delinquency rate, that was a little bit higher than normal in the third quarter and that was a pretty decent pick up year-over-year. Was that all related to timing? Or is it a little bit indicative of next year being a run rate charge-off level that's more consistent with what you guys had targeted this year? Thanks. Yeah, sure. So on delinquency, I'd say overall performance is well in line with our expectations and kind of three drivers to the increase year-over-year. One is just the normal and expected seasoning of the Used portfolio. We've talked for some time around the fact that used tends to have slightly higher risk content. Keep in mind we get paid 3 to 4 times that in the yield, so we're really pleased with the risk adjusted returns in that segment. But it does drive some higher frequency and we're just seeing that coming through here in Q3, again, well in line with our expectation. And then there's a couple of just what I would say operational impacts. One is we launched some new collections and servicing strategies over the last kind of four of eight quarters. And some of that's just pushing out repo timing and increasing the delinquency levels. It's improving flow-to-loss. So we're pleased with the overall performance of these strategies. But it does result in some slightly higher delinquencies. And then there's just nuances in terms of the day in which the quarter closes, that can drive some volatility in your delinquencies. And I'd say almost a third of that increase was due just to the fact that the quarter closed on a Monday instead of a Friday. So overall in line with expectations. To your question on where we're going, we would expect to, at some point, migrate up to that 1.4% to 1.6% retail net charge-off ratio, simply because that's where we're originating today. And so, as the Used portfolio continues to season as used vehicle values start to migrate down and we're still expecting that to occur, we'd have some increased severity. And so, over time, we'd expect to be more in line with that 1.4% to 1.6% range. Keep in mind, we get – we're pricing, that's where we drive risk-adjusted returns in our sweet spot. So we're good with that. All right, great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just comment on the decision to change to commission-free. I guess the industry is moving in that direction? And what the potential impact would be from a revenue perspective for you? Yeah, sure. Good morning, Arren, and maybe just – I'll take the second question first. The impact is extremely small for us. As a percent of overall Ally revenue, it's tiny. So from a financial perspective, it's pretty much a non-event. From a customer perspective, we feel very much like this business. It's capital-light. JB mentioned it increases the stickiness and the retention levels of our deposit portfolio and so we see value there. And over time, as we move to more of an advice-centric model and we're in the process of building that out, we think that this can be accretive from an ROE perspective. But I mean the bottom line here is when the industry moves you have to move with it. Otherwise, we'd lose some valuable customers and we didn't want to put ourselves in that position. JB, I don't know if you want to...? Perfectly covered Jenn. You got it. Okay. Thanks. Thank you for the question Arren. Sure. And just as a follow-up, there was – a few weeks ago there was an article on The Wall Street Journal talking about middle class not being able to afford a car loan these days and rolling over kind of underwater loans into new purchases and extending the terms. Are you seeing anything from a competitive standpoint where you're concerned about the trends that you're seeing within – in the auto finance? We're not – obviously, we're not seeing that in your charge-off rates or anything of that nature. Just curious what your comment would be about that. Yeah. Look, I mean, there's always going to be attention paid to the fringes and that's really how we view that commentary on the overall business. As we look at our business, nothing has changed in terms of the way in which we originate and JB mentioned in his comments that, we see extremely consistent FICO scores, payment to income scores, loan to value. We're not seeing any kind of deterioration in terms of term, et cetera. And if you look at the consumer,  I'd say, just right (00:40:50) in contrast, the consumer right now is performing extremely well. We've got 50-year low in unemployment. Debt servicing levels are actually at a 39-year low. They're under 10%. And so ability to pay continues to be strong and I think you see that in our year-to-date credit performance as well as just an incredibly robust application flow. We had record applications this quarter, continuing to be able to put price in the market. We're just not seeing it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Hey, guys. Thanks very much and congratulations on a good quarter. You touched a little bit on this in the last question, but I'm just wondering kind of thinking about incremental loan volume. Where are new – not new, new loan not new car loan, but new loan terms moving in terms of durations? And, I guess, yield margins and where do you see the competitive market going? Yeah, I mean, on retail auto, our term has not changed at all. And we've been very consistent year-after-year at just around 70-month term, and that has not changed. So, I guess that's answer to question one. Just in terms of yield, really robust yields. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of putting new origination yields on the books over 7%. And with the portfolio yield at 6.66%, we're very well-positioned to continue to see portfolio yields migrate up to those new origination yields. And I think the performance this quarter really speaks for itself in terms of ability to generate flows, continue to drive upward expansion on the asset side from a yield perspective. Okay. Thanks. And then, John, on the competitive front, I'd say very consistent obviously. I'm sure you saw one large bank talked about an increase in share that they took on, but we really didn't see it and didn't feel it in the third quarter. I think our flows were exceptionally strong. Added to the point that Jenn covered for six consecutive quarters of where we've been bringing in new loans at, we've been very pleased with the margin we're capturing there. So, I'd say the competitive environment remains very rational and we haven't seen any big shifts and structure or appetite lately at all. Okay. Appreciate that color and the follow-up question is you guys have been working on diversification. You talked a lot about new business lines and had some positive commentary with the Better.com partnership. And I think you've also mentioned historically that you're – in order for capital management, we might see incremental mix toward mortgage and so forth. I'm just wondering what do we think about kind of business mix as we enter next year and your focus on ongoing diversification. I'd say at high level, we see opportunities to grow all of our portfolios and that's auto, it's the mortgage as you're mentioning as well. And specifically in the mortgage space, the key to that business is managing operating expenses and with the partnership that we have with Better.com, we see an opportunity to be able to accrete ROE over time because we're able to bring down those operating expenses. We just closed the transaction with HCS. That's another opportunity we have to drive diversification. It's a $130-ish-billion market growing at 20% a year, drives ROAs in the 3% to 4% and so we see a really nice opportunity to continue to diversify through point of sale lending with our HCS acquisition as well. Great. Thanks, guys. Great. Thank you, John. Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Good morning. This is actually Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Hey. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Just wanted to dig into the other revenue lines a bit. I think this is the first quarter you've actually seen the adjusted fees exceed $400 million in several years. And in the not too distant past, you've kind of talked about that being a range of $375 million to $400 million quarter-to-quarter. So you're obviously seeing some good results in the Insurance business. You've had some good gains in the last couple of quarters and you're layering in that Ally Invest business over time. So I guess my question is, is it too early to think about the $400 million plus as kind of a new normal or how else should we think about that going forward? Yeah. I mean I would say we're absolutely focused on growing our fee income and our non-interest income. I am not ready to give you guidance quite yet. I mean we do see a lot of opportunities to continue to grow our fee income. Insurance, you saw had record levels of written premium. And you're seeing that record levels and continued momentum over time show up in the earned premium. And we see opportunities across all of our businesses in that space, the inventory insurance, the VSC insurance we provide, which by the way, is becoming more and more critical to dealer margins. We're just seeing a lot of opportunity to continue to expand our Insurance business. And that's not only the earned premium it's also gains that we take on the assets in that portfolio. So insurance is absolutely a growth engine for us. I'd say, second we grew our investment securities portfolio as rates were rising. And so, we're in a really strong position relative to kind of harvesting some gains around our investment securities portfolio as well. And then, as you mentioned, Ally Invest over time we're still bullish on this business. We think that there's opportunities to grow especially in the advisory space. It is supported by secular trends to digitization and we think we're very well-positioned to capture those growth opportunities as well. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Thank you. Your expenses picked up a little bit in the third quarter compared to the growth that we've seen in the first half. I mean, you mentioned that this could occur but could you just talk about the trajectory for expenses over the next few quarters? And some of the things that are driving the increasing expense growth? Yeah, sure and I do want to couple that with the revenue growth. But we – our focus is really around driving positive operating leverage and we've been driving positive operating leverage every quarter this year, and that is our intention as we move forward. But relative specifically to the growth in expenses, it's really been around the same themes that we've been discussing. One is continuing to invest in our core competencies around marketing and digital technologies and platforms, and continue to see some growth relative to continuing to evolve both marketing and digital and technology capabilities. Second, there is just a variable cost tied to just the terrific amount of customer growth we've seen across all of our businesses. And so, big chunk of that is just related to growing our business. And as I mentioned, there's revenue that comes along at an accelerated pace against that variable growth. And then last but not least just continuing to look for ways to grow long-term value for the company and for our customers, and the HCS transaction is the perfect example of that, and we will have some expense hitting Q4 relative to the closing of that acquisition. Those are the key themes. Okay, so do you expect the year-over-year growth rate to remain consistent with what we saw in the third quarter to persist or do you think it'll accelerate given the HCS transaction and then go forward? Yeah, I mean Q4 we have some seasonality and expenses relative to tech, marketing and HCS will close, which is kind of about half of that $25 million to $30 million in pre-tax impact in Q4. And for overall 2019, we're expecting to be well within our guidance of kind of flat to down a percent on efficiency ratio. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Jenn, I wanted to ask about the full-year guidance. You made the comment in your prepared remarks that you're on track to meet it. I just want to flesh out sort of the other piece of that with – because it seems like you've got some up – based on the prior three quarters, there should be some upside bias to the EPS part of the guidance. But your commentary around the Health Credit Services acquisition and the $25 million to $30 million, is that one-time in nature related to the close of the transaction or are there losses with that acquisition that will persist into 2020? Yeah, so good morning, Chris. A couple of things, so first of all on Q4, there is some seasonality in the quarter and I just mentioned some of the expense impacts there. We do have some impacts from an NII perspective, lease gains can be a little bit lumpy and we're still expecting used vehicle prices to come down a bit so little bit of pressure in terms of the sequential quarterly impact to NII. I mean year-over-year we will be up on NII but it's not always a linear path. And then on provision, we tend to have seasonality. They're no different than we've had in any fourth quarter in kind of the history of the company. So just keep in mind there's a seasonal element which is putting us back on track with our overall EPS guidance. And then relative to HCS, we closed the transaction and first quarter we've got some operating expenses, obviously that are a part of that transaction. They are not one time in nature. We would expect that expense to roll forward into 2020. And then second as we acquire portfolios, we've got about $250 million in balances that we'll build in Q4. And then as we continue to grow that portfolio there are some provision expense around it. Those are really the two big drivers. But taking a long-term view, really pleased again with the opportunity to drive earnings and accretive ROA and ROE asset over time. Okay. But I do want to keep – I do want to emphasize, one more point here, and that's the fact that we are sticking with our original guidance for this year. That's in spite of an incredibly volatile interest rate environment. And in spite of that, we've grown NII in-line with expectations. We're hitting that flat NIM number that we've been guiding towards. And taking a longer-term view, we're incredibly well-positioned to have continued NII growth and NIM expansion as we head into 2020. Okay. And then I had one question too about the Insurance business and the written premiums that if I'm looking at the trend correctly, they tend to be – you have higher written premium in the third quarter of each year. If you could just explain what's going on there. I understand the earned premium component of it, but just want to understand why written is stronger? What's seasonally going on there? Yeah. I mean there isn't really any key driver of growth there. I will say, as you look at both written and earned premiums, Chris, there's some lumpiness just related to reinsurance costs and so we mirror the reinsurance expenses with when we have weather losses and so you typically do see some higher reinsurance cost in the high weather quarters. But other than that, it's been a pretty linear growth trajectory from a written and an earned premium perspective. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you, Chris. Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Thanks very much. Jenn, I'm just trying to think through the capital lock on CET1 into next year, but maybe the preface to my main question is I think I saw you guys did a little bit of securitization in the period. Is that correct? And what was the CET1 benefit of that? So the short answer is yes, we did have some securitization activity, just business as usual. There's not any big CET1 impact related to that. Okay. And just on your CET1 question, I mean, we are being very thoughtful just in terms of continuing to grow CET1. And we're up about 50 basis points since fourth quarter. And that's really to position us well to absorb the day 1 impact from CECL. So we got 25% of the capital impact hitting in 2020. We're very well-positioned to absorb that. In addition to that, we have the HCS transaction that closed here in Q1, so that will be a Q4 event. And then above and beyond that, we are positioning ourselves very well to continue to look for strategic opportunities to deploy capital. We've done all of that in spite of distributing over $900 million in capital year-to-date in the form of repurchases and dividends. And so, we'll just continue to organically accrete capital, be very thoughtful in terms of RWA growth and balance sheet management and position ourselves not only to absorb CECL but also to make sure that we can stay focused on our strategic priorities. Great. And so if I can just maybe just follow up on that, my quick arithmetic on the day 1 CECL impact is about 90 bps with the phase in – well – and then I guess a quarter of that phased in pro rata. Is that ballpark correct? Yeah. I mean, think about it kind of in the 80% range overall and then you take 15% to 20% of that kind of in any given year. Take a quarter of that in any given year. So kind of tax effect, the reserve impact, take 25% of that over the next four years. Got it. And so then it sounds like the other dynamics is just the accretion, which is typically about 30 to 40 basis points and then a little bit of impact from HCS. Is that basically right? Yeah, yeah. Well done. Okay. All right. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Eric. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. When we look at the deposit mix and your targets and where we are today and we saw some nice funding relief this quarter, quarter-over-quarter, when you think about the interest rate path going forward that the implieds have, can you talk about if the quarter-over-quarter change in deposit costs and total funding costs could accelerate on a downward trajectory from here? Thanks. Yeah. I mean, it's not a perfect formula. As I mentioned earlier, we want to balance strategic focus on customer growth, balance growth. But we do feel we're well positioned. We're approaching our target funding level of 75% to 80%. I mentioned in my comments this morning that as the Fed continues to ease, we could continue to see opportunities to take down rates – OSA is down already 40 basis points. And that beta on the downs will be higher than the beta on the ups and I think that's probably the best way to think about it. Okay. Great thanks. And then when we think about, you did mention about the betas on the yield side. Can we talk a little bit more about where you think that may be and the ramp there over time on the auto yields in particular? Yeah. And you actually saw some really nice uplift in the lease yields this quarter. What's going on there if you don't mind talking about that? Thanks so much. Yeah, sure. Maybe I'll start with retail auto and then we can go to lease, but if you go back to the tightening cycle, we've passed on over 100% of the increase in the underlying benchmark rate to two to three year swap. And as we passed on that increase in the benchmark rate, that's when we really started to originate above that 7% mark. Now, if you look year-to-date, the underlying two to three year benchmark is down on average 130 basis points. And the beta on that has been zero, I mean, because we've just continued to put in pricing in the market above that 7% mark. Now, there's a number of dynamics there. One is healthy consumer has sustained car purchases, high demand as well as the fact that, well, the rate is up compared to a couple of years ago, we're well below the average from a historic time period. And so the overall interest rate on the car relative to payment-to-income and debt-to-income levels continues to be absorbed. So, we're not seeing a lot of overall price sensitivity from the consumer at this point. Now, as we go forward and Fed funds is top of mind and we see Fed funds potentially coming down, we could see some pressure on rates but we're just not seeing that at this point. And then relative to lease, we can have some lumpiness there especially related to lease gains. We had a really strong lease gain quarter this quarter. That's been sustained by very strong used vehicle prices. We are, as I've mentioned several times, expecting used vehicle values to come down at some point. But overall, this quarter we had a really nice pickup because of lease gains sustained by used car performance, which continues to be very strong. And then if I may just one more. On the mortgage business, we saw year-over-year loan growth kind of slow a bit. Is that from one of the sales there of why the growth slowed, or is there may be a different strategy taking place or is this a one-off? And what do you see in the mortgage market today given the increased mortgage application spike more recently? Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Yeah, no. Sure. Maybe I'll separate the DTC versus bulk. In the DTC side, we absolutely see a lot of growth and I mentioned we hit $800 million in originations, which is a record quarter for us and puts us well on the path to originate up to that $3 billion mark that we've set for ourselves. So on a DTC side really bullish on the product offering we have, the opportunity to continue to grow originations especially as refi volume has peaked here. And so we'll continue to grow DTC and with the Better.com partnership we think we can get really great returns on that business as well. On the bulk side, you're absolutely right. We have brought down the balances and a little bit of a shift in strategy there just as we have seen early prepayments and amortization expense increase we've just been really thoughtful about the way in which we grow that book. And we did have a loan sale. Part of that was just positioning around the LIBOR transition, but part of that was just exiting some of the lower yield, and portfolios that were in the money because of the rate drop. So we'll continue to be incredibly thoughtful as we allocate capital to bulk, just making sure we get the right yields that are accretive to the book. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am showing we do have time for one last question. And our last question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Jenn, I actually had a lease question and I thought you were going to touch on it, but I'm a little bit – I'd like a little bit of clarification. The lease yields were up nicely year-over-year, but if you look at the gains from vehicle sales they were actually flat. So I'm curious if this is a mix shift in terms of the new vintages. Is there more pricing power in the lease business or was there actually a change to the depreciation curves that you guys are using? Yeah. So I mean the short answer to all of that is no. We did see strong origination flow this quarter and we were up about a couple hundred million in terms of the flow. But we've been guiding towards kind of X gains of low 5% yield and I think we've been trending kind of right in line with that. And then anything above that 5% is related to the gains and the trajectory around the gains. But no, no real trends Rick, just in terms of our overall lease portfolio. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Thanks, thank you Rick. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Daniel Eller for any closing remarks. Thanks operator. All I'll say is that if you have additional questions please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations and we thank you for joining our call this morning. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a questions-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the third quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon's Interim CEO, will lead the call. Then, Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's remarks, there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions. Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation, and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 16, 2019, and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Todd. Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Glad to be back with you. As it's my first time speaking to you as CEO, I will focus my comments on my immediate priorities, as well as my perspectives on our businesses and will only briefly touch on our third quarter results. I'll leave that to Mike. First, let me say how tremendously excited I am to be leading this great organization. During my long career at BNY Mellon, I've held leadership roles across risk, finance, client management and many of our businesses, and I believe that gives me a strong grasp of the fundamentals of our company and what our stakeholders need and expect from us. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Mike and the rest of the executive committee, as well as all of our employees to stay on course in positioning our franchise to drive better performance and create sustainable growth. We've got an ambitious agenda, and I strongly believe that we're absolutely on the right path. The improvements we've made to our culture are clear. We're acting with a greater sense of urgency and greater responsiveness, and I'm proud of the team's ability to stay focused through leadership change and to continue to deliver great service to our clients. It's my intention to ensure we maintain a strong performance culture and remain focused on service quality, continue investing in technology and innovation, and improving every aspect of our operations. Through that focus, we have made significant progress in the last few years which I believe positions us to improve our results over the longer term. Now, while I was Head of Global Client Management as well as a number of our servicing businesses, I've had the pleasure of working closely with our clients. During this period, I've seen us meaningfully improve our services, as well as provide the technology and expertise to help them navigate challenges and achieve their goals. Our investments in our operations and technology are improving and broadening our capabilities, and the adjustments we've made to our client coverage model are helping us deepen relationships and identify more opportunities. Before getting into the quarter, let me run through what I'm seeing in our businesses. In Asset Servicing, we continue to see the opportunity to do more for our clients as changes in the Asset Management business puts pressure on their operating margins. These trends should offer more outsourcing opportunities in key segments such as alternatives. In terms of what we're actually doing, we're focused on continuously improving quality, which is fundamental. We're also investing and expanding capabilities to serve alternatives, such as private equity, credit funds, real estate and ETFs. For example, we just recently implemented a significant mandate with Goldman Sachs Asset Management who appointed us to deliver a range of asset services for their newly launched European ETFs, and we're encouraged by our traction in this space. We are building data and analytic solutions to help clients navigate a changing investment management landscape, the basic offering starts with a powerful aggregation capability. We can then apply analytics around that. Leveraging our data and analytic solutions technology, we enabled a large global asset manager to insource $250 billion of AUM within three months. The client now has a higher level of transparency into cash and positions for the front office trading and has achieved better operational efficiency by leveraging their previous investments in our technology. We think our data and analytics capabilities will be a true differentiator over time. So, the alliances we're forming will create a more integrated front-to-back operating model. We recently announced a strategic alliance with Bloomberg to integrate our data analytics and servicing capabilities with Bloomberg's portfolio management, trading and compliance platform. This will allow our common clients to experience faster onboarding, higher straight-through processing rates, and more efficient data exchanges. This new partnership comes on the back of the one we announced with BlackRock's Aladdin platform earlier this year. Client reception to our partnerships has been positive as it helps them simplify workflows, improve efficiency and drive their performance. In Pershing, we're focused on helping our clients drive their business in a dynamic industry. The pipeline of opportunity remains strong, and we onboarded a number of new clients in the broker-dealer and registered investment advisor space. In the high-growth wealth and advisory segment, we're investing in technology to improve the client experience, as well as investing in talent and strengthening brand awareness. One of our priorities is to meet emerging client needs as investor preferences drive firms to transform. For example, we're enabling clients to integrate our technology and leverage pre-built business functions such as trading, reporting and asset movement without them having to make big investments in their own technology. Overall, we're very excited about the potential for Pershing. Moving on to Clearance and Collateral Management, it's a key differentiator for us. Tri-party collateral management balances are up, mainly the result of growth from existing clients and new business and, to a lesser extent, from last year's client conversions. We're confident in the organic growth prospects of this business. We are currently rebuilding our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move securities globally, as well as offer enhanced resiliency in data and analytic capabilities not currently available in the market. We think it will significantly boost our ability to attract new market participants, as well as additional business from our existing clients. In Corporate Trust, we're seeing benefits from the investments we made in structured products, and we continue to build our capabilities to better serve clients. This is broadening our relationships, especially in the important alternative asset manager segment. In Treasury Services, we've been refocusing on higher margin and high-growth businesses, such as trade, foreign exchange, and our liquidity offering. Our clients consistently tell me our service is excellent which reflects on the quality of our people. In addition, we're looking to build off the investments we've made in real-time payments. In Asset Management, we feel good about a number of the underlying strategies and continue to invest in the US and build solutions to meet investor demand. We're actively launching new products across a number of areas, including fixed income products, ESG, enhanced beta, and multiasset solutions. For example, Alcentra raised €5.5 billion for its European Direct Lending Fund, double the minimum target. We're investing in rebranding to consistently use The BNY Mellon brand and make it easier to navigate our multi-boutique model. Lastly, performance has been solid across many of the larger strategies. Moving to Wealth Management, it's strengthening our banking and investment products and creating a strong foundation by investing in people, technology and platform. Now, let me turn briefly to our results for the third quarter. EPS was $1.07, that's up 1% versus a year ago. Total revenue was down 5% year-over-year, and that was largely driven by net interest revenue. There are a couple of items that impacted both revenue and expense, and Mike will walk you through those in some detail. Our Investment Services fee lines were up nearly across the board, as the investment decisions we've been making are starting to yield some incremental positive results. Operating margin was once again resilient at 33%, and we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on page 3 of the Financial Highlights document, first, the table in the bottom of the page summarizes a couple of notable items in the quarter that had a very small impact on earnings on a net basis, but did impact net interest revenue and expenses. I will describe them later in more detail, and as a reminder, the table also includes some items we highlighted in the third quarter of 2018. This quarter, total revenue was down 5% to $3.9 billion. The notable items negatively impacted revenue by a little under 1.5%. The remaining decline primarily reflected lower net interest revenue, the impact of prior-year outflows in Asset Management, and lower performance fees, as well as the impact of the stronger US dollar. While total fee revenue was down 1% year-on-year, Investment Services fees were up in most categories, as Todd mentioned, excluding securities lending. Net interest revenue was down 18%, partially driven by a $70 million lease-related impairment. The impairment was for a legacy portfolio of leases and decreased net interest revenue by 8% and earnings per share by $0.06. Expenses were down 5%, mainly reflect a $74 million net reduction of reserves that benefited non-interest expenses and increased earnings per share by approximately $0.06. This was related to a pre-tax charge that was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 in connection with potential tax-related exposures of certain investment management funds that we manage. Excluding this and the impact of lower litigation charges, expenses were essentially flat. A few other highlights from the page: pre-tax income declined by 4% to $1.3 billion; the effective tax rate was 19.1% compared to 16.5% in the year-ago quarter; we generated $1 billion in net income applicable to common shareholders; earnings per share of $1.07 was up 1%; and our pre-tax operating margin was 33%. Now, moving to capital and liquidity on page 4. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. Our key ratios were similar to the second quarter. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.3 billion and our CET1 ratio was 11.1% under the Advanced Approach. Our average LCR in the third quarter was 117% and our SLR was 6.1%. Turning to page 5, my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes, as this is a better comparison for you. Our average interest-earning assets increased due to client deposits driving our balance sheet higher. The average rate earned on interest-earning assets declined in the third quarter primarily as a result of the impairment that I mentioned earlier. Excluding this, the average rate would've been down only slightly. The average rate was negatively impacted by the Fed and ECB lowering interest rates. This resulted in US short-term rates moving lower by 20 basis points to 30 basis points, while the long-end was down by around 50 basis points since the second quarter, which impacted the yield in our securities portfolio. This was partially offset by a modest benefit from our repo activity. Loans increased in Clearance and Collateral Management, and our trade loans grew within Treasury Services. However, we continue to see low appetite for leverage in Pershing which continues to impact our margin loan balances. As expected, non-interest-bearing deposits declined, while interest-bearing deposits increased. Deposit betas were broadly in line with our expectations, and the net interest margin decreased by 3 basis points to 109 basis points excluding the impairment. Page 6 gives you some more detail of the drivers of the net interest revenue decline versus the second quarter. As I mentioned, we saw a continued decline in average non-interest-bearing deposits which had a negative impact on net interest revenue. We had a benefit from the increase in average interest-bearing deposits, as well as lower deposit pricing due to the rate cuts. Competitive pressure on deposit rates appears to have stabilized since the second quarter, but remains high. The yield on the securities portfolio was down by 15 basis points, which more than offset the benefit of higher portfolio balances. Loan balances were mixed with non-margin loans up and margin loans down, and coupled with lower rates as the assets are typically floating rate, this negatively impacted net interest revenue. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy our balance sheet and took advantage of higher reverse repo rates which modestly benefited net interest revenue. As a reminder, we engage in limited hedging and funding activities that this quarter positively impacted net interest revenue and our net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. There's an offset to that reflected in FX and other trading. Finally, the lease-related impairment of $70 million reduced net interest revenue to $730 million. Now, page 7 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.6 billion were down 5%. The decrease reflects the reduction in reserves for tax-related exposure of certain investment management funds and the lower litigation expense that I mentioned earlier. Excluding those items, expenses were largely flat with our investments being offset by declines in other expenses. Turning to page 8, total Investment Services revenue was down slightly. Assets under custody and/or administration increased 4% year-over-year to $35.8 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Within Asset Servicing, revenue was down 4% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower client activity, securities lending revenue and net interest revenue, as well as the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. As we have said in the past, we have not seen an acceleration in pricing pressure in the business. Securities lending revenue continues to be negatively impacted by lower balances on the back of weak market demand and tighter spreads, and foreign exchange and other trading revenue was slightly down as FX volumes and volatility remain subdued. In Pershing, revenue was up 2% to $568 million, reflecting higher client asset values and accounts together with higher clearing and custody volumes. This was partially offset by lower net interest revenue. Clearing services fees were up 7%, as we continue to onboard new clients and we benefit from growth of the existing clients. We are encouraged by the momentum we are building in the business with both RIAs and broker-dealers. Issuer Services benefited from higher activity in Depositary Receipts. Revenue was up 3% to $466 million, with 13% fee growth, mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. Growth in Corporate Trust benefited from new business and volumes, and Depositary Receipts revenue was up due to the timing of fees and higher cross-border settlement activity. Treasury Services revenue was down 4% to $312 million, with fees up slightly year-on-year, while net interest revenue was lower. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by over 20%. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 11% to $293 million due to higher clearance volumes related to heightened levels of US Treasury issuance. In recent quarters, a majority of our growth was driven by the client conversions from last year, but in the third quarter, this shifted with more than two-thirds of the increase coming from existing and other new clients. As a reminder, the client conversions were in the run rate starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, and average tri-party collateral management balances were up 19%. And I also want to note that the recent volatility in the repo markets was not a driver of the revenue growth in Clearance and Collateral Management. Page 9 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our Investment Services businesses. Turning to Investment Management on page 10, total Investment Management revenue was down 12%. Asset Management revenue was down 14% year-over-year to $605 million, primarily reflecting the cumulative AUM outflows since the third quarter of 2018, as well as lower performance fees, the impact of hedging activities, and the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar principally versus the British pound, which was partially offset by higher market values. Performance fees decreased due to a particularly strong year of performance for our LDI strategies last year. Our largest revenue strategies continue to have solid performance over both short and longer time frames. We had inflows of $1 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by cash inflows  in abatement and (00:19:00) index outflows. We had $11 billion of inflows in the cash and $2 billion of inflows in the fixed income products, while our other strategies saw outflows of $12 billion. Overall assets under management of $1.9 trillion are up 3% year-over-year due to higher markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar and net outflows. Wealth Management revenue was down 8% year-over-year to $285 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, partially offset by higher market values. Turning to our Other segment on page 11, total revenue and net interest expense decreased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting the lease-related impairment and corporate treasury activity. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a few things to consider. With respect to net interest revenue, market dynamics are changing quickly, but let me walk you through what we are seeing now, which I'll remind you is very early, and you should make your own assumptions as well. The market appears to be pricing at a Fed cut in October and another in early next year, potentially January, which impacts the forward curves. We expect the average non-interest-bearing deposit balances will continue to come down. As of now, our interest-bearing deposits are a little lower than the third quarter. We do not expect the issues in the repo market to repeat themselves. This will negatively impact net interest revenue by approximately 1% versus the third quarter. And we expect the portfolio yield to come down versus the third quarter. If these assumptions persist, we would expect that net interest revenue will be down sequentially by approximately 4% to 6% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter. In Issuer Services, we expect full year fees to be around the same as in 2018, give or take a little bit, so we expect a down-tick in the fourth quarter. As we announced during the third quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in Promontory Interfinancial Network with an expected after-tax gain of approximately $600 million. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter subject to approvals. As we continue to streamline and optimize the company, we may look for opportunities to accelerate actions, which could result in pre-tax charges in the fourth quarter in the range of $100 million to $200 million. And a reminder, that we had some notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018, something else to factor into your modeling. With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? Yes, sir.  Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Hello. Thanks a lot. I know it's a different client base, but I'm curious if you think the pricing reductions on the e-broker side and the retail side of the  e-broker land (00:22:07) can have an impact on to your Pershing RIA clearing business? Just could you help us think through that? Sure. Good morning, Glenn. It's Todd. Our business model was quite a bit different than the e-traders. As you know, we're a B2B, we're not a B2C business, so we don't actually charge commissions. We get paid on a number of different revenue streams like assets, as well as to clearing and settlement. So, we don't foresee this as having any material impact at this time. Okay. And maybe just a quickie follow-up on the NII, because I appreciate – I just want to make sure I wrote it down, the NIR down 4% to 6% versus the lease-adjusted number in the third quarter. And could you just repeat that part? I just want to make sure that we get the right jumping-off point for 4Q and rolling into next year. Yeah. Hey, Glenn, it's Mike. If you look at page 6 of the deck, the lease-adjusted number for the third quarter was $800 million, so that's your jumping-off point, and so the 4% to 6% off of that base. And if you – in my commentary I also mentioned part of the decline is related to the modest benefit we saw from the repo activity in the third quarter, so that's about 1% of it. And the rest is just the cuts we've seen and the deposit migration? Correct. Yeah. It's net interest-bearing deposits coming down a little bit. It's the yield on the portfolio continuing to grind down a bit. And it's based on where we see deposit balances right now which are a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter. But as you know, it's very early in the quarter to project with a high degree of certainty at this point. Okay. And I just want to make sure, you saw some extra deposit flight in from the repo mess in the quarter, but unclear if they stick around – I'm putting words in your mouth, but I just want to see what your thoughts are. Yeah. No, I think the incremental deposits we saw in the third quarter were not necessarily related to the repo volatility. That was just underlying client behavior. We made some money by deploying some of our excess liquidity into the repo market during those few days. That coupled with our cleared repo program that we've got for clients is where we made the extra money during those few days of the volatility. (00:24:58). Glenn, that wasn't a huge amount of money. I mean, we have a lot of liquidity. If there's a little bit of a distortion in the market, we'll take advantage of it, and we did, and it had a little bit of help, but it didn't impact balances. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Todd, first just a quick one at sort of a high level. Just wanted to – interested in your thoughts on level-setting and very helpful to hear your comments in the beginning of the call. But clearly, we had a bit of a movement on the top here with BK with Charlie moving on and you stepping in. And so, clearly you're part of the management team, you've been at Bank of New York for a very, very long time, developed the plan, so that seems straightforward. But can you help us maybe think about tactical time frames? How is the board thinking about their search at this point? Most investors assume that you're going to be part of the consideration for that search. Is that fair? And could you help us think about just in the near term how there might be some tactical adjustments in strategy, or is it going to be very, very similar to how we've been going, steady as she goes, so to speak? Okay, Brennan. There is a lot there. But let me start that with the change at the top, the board executed its succession plan and it's going through the due diligence and it has initiated a search, and I have indicated my interest to be a part of that. So, that's in process and we don't have any strict time frames on that. That will flow as it flows. And in terms of my own priorities and anything tactical that we're seeing, frankly, I've been in the middle of driving the change agenda that's been going on that Charlie had led over the past couple of years, and I've really felt like I'm an integral part of it. Actually, I've enjoyed it. So, what I'm not going to do is revert back to some of the ways that things were. So, we're going to continue to drive a very strong performance culture. I see us holding ourselves more accountable. We really expect and demand excellence from each other, and I'm not going to let that change, so that's at the high level. The investments that we're making in technology are going to continue. They're going to be focused on a number of things, not only that we make our services more resilient, that we improve the client experience. And where we're having some real success is around improving operational efficiency, so that continues to be high on my list. And I think there is a lot more and it would follow my next point here is that we'll automate and continue to approve operations. I think we got a lot of tractions there. We can point to a lot of successes and opportunity to do more. I got to stay focused on regulatory relations given who we are and what we're doing, and so that will be a high priority. And finally, Mike and I are now pouring through the planning process and we've got to make good decisions around our investment opportunities. We have quite a number of them and actually that will be fun. So, I think it's been a very smooth transition. At this point, I don't think anything has changed. And I really am quite pleased with the leadership team how smoothly they've moved on. That's great color. Thank you so much, Todd, for that. One question here for Mike. Previously you guys had guided to the back half of 2019 being flat for operating expenses versus the back half of 2018. I believe that the core expenses in the back half of 2018 were $5.4 billion. Looks like core expenses this quarter was $2.7 billion. Does that mean that we should be looking at core expenses for the fourth quarter to be roughly flat with core to this quarter? Is that fair? Yeah. I think give or take a little bit, Brennan. But, yeah, I mean, I think the guidance we gave in terms of sort of being flat year-on-year, give or take a little bit, still holds. Okay.  (29:27) obviously, laid out the charges, but that would not be core, right? Correct. Yeah. You have to look through that. Perfect. All right. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Morning, Gerard. And, Gerard, you may be on mute. Oh, thank you. I apologize about that. I was on mute. Thank you. Following up on your comments about the repo disruption and how you had a small benefit, and I know you don't expect it going forward, can you guys give us any color? Is there any benefit of the Treasury now or the Fed, I should say, coming back in? They're not calling it a quantitative easing, but we know they're going to come in and start buying securities. Do you guys see any benefits for your business from their activities? Well, the Fed conducts its open market transactions through repo and they do use our repo platform, our tri-party platform, for some of those transactions. It would be very, very modest, if any, impact to our revenue. So, it will, obviously, impact the rate at which repo trades, but it's a de minimis impact. The good news about the business and the tri-party business and the Collateral Management business is it continues to grow. So, we saw a significant growth in the past quarter. Some of that, less than about a third or so of that was from the conversions that we had from last year. But the rest of it is either new clients or additional growth of the existing clients. Collateral management and repo, it is growing as the uncleared margin rules grow and the demand for secured credit grows. So, we like our position there, and I can go on more about this because one of our biggest investments has been what we call the future of collateral management and making our systems interoperable in a way that just makes it seamless for our clients to move collateral. That will have a huge benefit to them. So, key focus for us, but the disruption in the repo market had little, if any, impact. Very good, Todd. And then, just a follow-up, you gave us good color on the sequential look into net interest revenue and what the forward curve is saying about future Fed fund rate cuts. If you guys could paint us a picture for 2020, what would be an ideal interest rate environment for you to benefit from a net interest revenue standpoint? Again, I know it's – I don't want to hold you to it, but just curious what would be that ideal environment. I'll take it. I'm looking at Mike here. A steeper yield curve and fewer eases, it really isn't a lot more complex than that. Very good. No, I appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Usdin (sic) [Ken Usdin] with Jefferies. Hey, good morning, guys. I just have a couple of follow-ups on the NII front. Hey, Mike, so can you talk a little about – it seems like if the balance sheet were to be flattish from here even that the NIM obviously is still grinding down. Can you talk us through – you mentioned a little less competitiveness on the deposit side, but the dynamics of the asset portfolio repricing that whole – the three quarters aspect versus what you're seeing on the deposit betas, can you give us some color on both sides of what you're seeing? Thanks. Yeah. I'll start with the portfolio, Ken. And obviously, what you're seeing in the portfolio is yields continue to grind down as sort of rates have come down. It's really no more complicated I think than that. And about a third of our portfolio reprices every quarter, either through securities maturing and get reinvested or through the floating rate component of it. And in most cases, the rates in the portfolio are moving ahead of when the Fed moves. And so, you're going to see a decline in the asset yields first. And then, when the Fed moves, you're able to move deposit pricing down. And so, you're going to have that lag. And so as rates are declining, it has a negative impact during that period. I think on the pricing side, what I said was pricing remains competitive, although it stabilized over the last 90 days, 120 days or so. And so, we're seeing pretty consistent competition across a whole series of our competitors, but we're not seeing anything that's irrational across that set right now. Okay. And I guess as a follow-up then, so if we just play it forward and you look at your forward curve, and you mentioned the October and the potentially early 2020, at what point do you see the yields on the asset side starting to level up because of that three quarter rollthrough? Do we get to a point in early next year where you've just kind of flushed everything down? How do we start to assess like when that bottoming point might happen? I mean, look, I think that's the question I think most people are thinking about. And I think the – as you sort of look at – as you look at it, it starts to stabilize when forward start to stabilize, right? And I think when you look at forwards right now, it's still declining as you look out. And so, I think when forward start to stabilize, you'll start to see the portfolio yield stabilize as well. Okay. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. All right. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Great. Yeah, just quick questions. One, you did mention that the Promontory sale was going to close this quarter. Was that mean that gain can be used for additional share repurchase, have you decided to do that, or is that already included in the CCAR plan? It's something we'll consider as we look forward for our capital plan next year. So, no, it was not included in our CCAR plan for this year. So, we couldn't take that because it hadn't taken place. Right. Okay, so you're not going to do additional share repurchase this year though? We will consider it as part of the plan next year. Okay. And then just focusing on the Investment Management business, I mean, you have negative operating leverage in there year-on-year. I mean, what does it take to kind of generate positive operating leverage in that segment again? So, if you look at our Investment Management business, a number of the businesses are doing pretty well. Our LDI business continues to grow. Our  alts and (00:36:43) credit business in Alcentra is doing pretty well. And, in fact, our managers in the UK are doing reasonably well. Where we are challenged is in our business in the States, and we've taken some steps to combine those businesses into, what we now call, Mellon. But until we see that stabilize, it's going to be – that's where the challenge really resides. So, we need to see some improvement in the performance. We think we – by combining in there things that we can do operationally to continue to manage the cost, but that's our focus point. Okay. Great. Thanks. And next we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Great. Hey. Good morning, guys. Question around deposit growth this quarter, obviously, pretty nice trends sequentially. I know that's been a strategic focus for you guys to get a larger share of kind of customers' wallet over time. So, maybe talk a little bit about the sources of growth this quarter and sort of the traction you're getting in terms of wallet share gain? Thanks. Hey, Alex, it's Mike. As you highlighted, we've been focused for the better part of a year or a little over that sort of really driving more share of client deposits through a whole series of initiatives. And I think I mentioned in my commentary around Treasury Services, which is a good example where deposits are up around 20%, and I think that's a great example where it's not only about getting deposits, it also brings with it other activity and fees with it as we sort of go after those relationships. And I think that effort that we've got is really across every single one of our businesses, within Asset Servicing, Corporate Trust, Treasury Services, Wealth Management, and I think to varying degrees we've had success in growing our share of operating deposits across the different client segments. Yeah, I would add to that, Alex. This was not a focus of ours in years went past, especially in a zero rate environment and with leverage ratios and so forth. But today, we've established a couple of these campaigns and we've been pretty successful. And we're a very attractive client for the – or counterparty for depositors. And when we can connect it to the businesses, it makes a lot of sense. So, the more we can get the payments business, the more opportunity we've gotten to grow our deposit base. So, it's largely just increase focused and targeted campaigns. Got it. Thanks. And then a more  tactical (00:39:31) question I guess. With the Fed being back in the market buying T-bills, historically, we've kind of viewed the depositary base of the trust banks as somewhat correlated with the level of excess reserves in the banking system. Would this create a similar dynamics? In other words, if the Fed becomes again more aggressive in buying back treasuries and T-bills, would that be an overall  help or – to the size of the balance sheet as we go (00:39:54) forward? Thanks. I mean, the deposits have been correlated in the past to excess reserves, but you really need to look at it over a period of time. And in any given quarter, that may or may not be the case and we'll see how the most recent announcement and activity levels sort of play out. And the Fed's just getting into the market now at this week. I think some of those trades settle later in the week for the first time. And so, I think it's too early to know exactly what impact it's going to have. And I think you really need to think about it over some period of time, and quarter-to-quarter, it may not play out exactly as the historical trend might indicate. Okay. Next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Great. Great. Thanks very much. A question for both Todd and Mike on the expenses, I think, Mike, you mentioned – if I wrote this down correctly – an estimate of $100 million to $200 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. If you can talk about the underlying expense that that is projected to reduce, I guess, going into next year,  cognizant that (00:41:18) you probably don't want to give guidance for next year yet, but just to get a sense of that. And then I guess bigger picture, Todd, you talked for a long time about investing in technology to increasingly automate the business and reduce that operational cost. And you've just done a lot over the last several years in making progress on that. So, just trying to get a sense of, as we move forward over the next, say, one to two years, do we have a lot more runway in those initiatives to the extent that we can keep the expenses at least flat for the organization or even down? Okay. Brian, why don't I take the latter part of that and I'll hand it over to Mike for the earlier part of the question. We've got nearly 100 programs in place, so we do continue to see significant opportunity to automate a lot more, things like reconciliations. When you look at the accounting platforms and the NAV calculations, there are still many manual processes in there that we are targeting. So, I kind of look at – and there are still locations that we need to manage where there's opportunity. And as we look out to 2020 and some of the things that we can accelerate, I'll call out a couple of items. Number one, I think around reconciliations, we can increase the scalability  of the line (00:42:46). We've actually been applying machine learning and creating much, much more automated reconciliation process. Doesn't seem like a lot, but if you think about what we do as a company, it is a massive undertaking with a huge amount of head count dedicated to it. We're also investing in a client inquiry system where we'll digitize all of the clients' inquiries into us. That doesn't sound like a lot either, but if you can imagine the millions of transactions that we process, if we can automate how we capture queries around it. We're also automating our instruction capture. And as I mentioned earlier, there's opportunity for us to do more around the accounting services and striking net asset values. So, as I look out over the next two or three years, this is not a – we're not stopping. There's a lot more that I think we can do here. Yeah. And I think as you think about the charges and investments we're making, we've got a very disciplined process to look at the ROIs and the payback periods for each of the investments, and we do that for all of them. So, you should assume we're doing that as we look at the investments we're making. Okay, that's all great color. And then just to follow up on the Asset Servicing, I think, Todd, you talked about increasing some of the servicing capabilities for alternatives. Do you feel that your – the platform that you have for that right now is adequate to do that, or are there potential significant enhancements to come either organically or through acquisition? And, I guess, could you leverage BlackRock's eFront – recently acquired eFront platform, I know you've got the relationship with Aladdin? Yeah. Let me go to the beginning of that. When we look at the real estate servicing business, we're growing that quite rapidly from investments that we've made previously, and that's just continuing to capture the market. So, we see opportunities there without a whole lot of more investment, we'll have to obviously keep the platform current. Where we are making some investments is more around private equity and credit platforms, and we've got a couple of potential wins there. And we are not just looking at BlackRock, but at others for potential partnerships that we might be able to leverage as well. So, yeah, we think in the alt space, without a huge amount of investment, we can continue to capture some growth and some market share. Got it. Okay. Great, thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. All right, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, just given some of the traction you're seeing in Pershing and Collateral Management, just where is the firm today in terms of maybe market share? And what strategies you're putting in place to drive additional organic growth and bring on additional clients? Okay. Well, I'll start with Collateral Management first. So, if you think about our Collateral Management business, it's primarily around tri-party repo, but there are also uncleared margin rules that are going into effect where the buy side now has to collateralize its derivative transactions. And those are phased in and then so that market is actually growing, so we are benefiting from that. Where we're investing is to make it seamless for our clients to move collateral around the world on our platforms which will make them much more efficient. Effectively what it does for them, it reduces the amount of liquidity and capital that they have to commit to their own business, so it generates real funding benefits to them. So, they're quite excited about it. The other thing we're doing is we're investing in the automation of the rule sets. So, if you think about the tri-party repo, two parties  have to have (00:46:47) rules and we've automated that rather than making it a manual process which makes it much, much easier for them to initiate transactions. So, that's number one. Number two, if you look at the world's repo market, only about 25% of that uses its tri-party today. And as we provide these type of services, it will make it much more attractive for people that are doing things in what they call a bilat repo, which is just doing it directly. So, we think we can either use tri-party services or act as the custodian, so we think there's growth potential there. So, that's one of the things that we're driving for and that will be a two-year process and we're pretty excited about the prospects there. There's a lot going on in the space. The other question was around Pershing, but... Same question. Yeah. Pershing, it's a little less impactful on the collateral management space. Pershing is really providing clearance and custody for broker-dealers, investment advisors, and to some extent there's some prime business there with hedge funds as well. And the beauty there is that market is growing, the advisory business is growing quite rapidly. We're on the corporate side of that, so there was some lost business due to consolidations. We've now implemented enough new business to start to offset that. I think Mike had made that very clear on previous earnings calls, and so we see ourselves and the potential to start showing some growth  there (00:48:20). All right. That's helpful. And then, just a quick clean-up, Mike, just on the reserve release, did you fully exit the exposure on the utility and then same thing on the tax rate, just on the low end, any update in terms of the guidance or the outlook? We did fully dispose of the exposure for the utilities, so there is no more left. And on the tax rate, it's a little noisy just given the ins and outs this year, but we haven't given full year guidance. But what we said in the past is sort of 21% plus or minus. My guess is it will be a little bit below that 21%. Okay. Thanks. Next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Yeah. Good morning, guys. In the  (00:49:14) business, can you give us some details or some thoughts on client attrition? How that's been performing recently versus prior years? And what are you doing to maybe improve retention? Rob, your phone like gave out there a little bit on which business you were talking about. Which business was it? The core business. The Asset Servicing business? Yeah. Sure. I'll take a shot and Todd can add some color in there. I think as we look at the things that we're doing to continue to improve the quality of the service we have, that is directly aimed at continuing to reduce attrition and improve the service levels for our clients. And I think where we have put focus on that with our largest clients, we're seeing really good traction and results. I think so when you look at the impact that client losses or attrition had in the quarter, it's pretty similar to what you would have seen over the last number of quarters or a couple of years. Okay. Thanks. And then, Todd, you mentioned decision making around upcoming investment opportunities. Seems like we've talked about a few of them here, but maybe at a higher level, can you talk about your priorities and any additional color on the opportunities you're most excited about? Thank you. Yeah. I spelled out the priorities earlier and they really continue to basically be continue with the change agenda that I've been part of over the past couple of years. And I look forward to continuing to drive that. So, we're not going to revert to practices that were weaker than where I think we are now. That's for sure. Right now where I think we're seeing opportunities is in the wealth space, around Pershing and in our own Wealth Management business in the – we talked about the  Collateral Management (00:51:13) business probably in too much detail today. I gave you a lot color there. But Asset Servicing still has quite a few opportunities. We talked a little bit about alt. But to Mike's earlier point around attrition, as long as our capabilities are as strong as they are and our services is good as it is, the attrition rate will go down. And I think we'll keep moving the needle on that. You're always going to have some clients leave for some reason or other, but we've got to make it more and more difficult for them to leave. That's why we're pretty keen on these partnerships that we've had, the one that we announced with Bloomberg in the quarter is another indication of that, and by being able to make it much more convenient for them to do business with us by a single sign-on through Bloomberg to get all kinds of custody information makes it more difficult to leave, and that's what we want to do. Got it. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. All right, thanks, everyone. We'll talk to you next time. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. A replay of this conference will be available on The BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a good day."

         "Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our President and CEO, Curt Farmer; Interim CFO, Jim Herzog; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Director of our Business Bank, Peter Sefzik. During this presentation, we will be referring to slides that provide additional details. The presentation slide and our press release are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. This conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to materially vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement in today's release and slide 2, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our SEC filings for factors that can cause actual results to differ. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures. And in that regard, I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation. Now, I'll turn the call over to Curt, who will begin on slide 3. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $292 million or $1.96 per share. Our third quarter results demonstrated our ability to drive strong returns with an ROE of 16%, an ROA of 1.6% despite declines in interest rates. Relative to the second quarter, broad-based fee income growth, solid credit quality, the benefit of discrete tax items, and continued active capital management were positive contributors to our performance. In addition, our careful cost control helped keep our efficiency ratio low at under 52%. Historically loans in the third quarter are seasonal weak. This year average loans were stable compared to the second quarter. Mortgage Banker benefited from robust refi activity along with a normal increase due to summer home sale activity. However, this was offset by the seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2020 model as well as the difficult summer slowdown in Middle Market. Overall, customer sentiment remains positive and our pipeline is solid. We also seen a benefit of a number of initiatives we've undertaken over the past year or so. This includes our new enterprise-wide customer relationship management tool and enhanced marketing analytics and greater efficiency, resulting from our credit process redesign. Average deposits grew over $700 million relative to the second quarter, including $850 million increase in customer money market balances and CDs. We had a favorable deposit mix; as nearly half are noninterest bearing and we believe we will continue to have the lowest component of noninterest-bearing deposits amongst our peers. As we have throughout the cycle, we are carefully managing deposit rates in order to attract and retain relationships. We are closely monitoring the competitive environment. We expect to continue to modestly lag competition in adjusting our rates. Our strategy is working. The growth in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding and helped reduce our loan total funding cost to 78 basis points. Also, our loan to deposit ratio decreased to 91%. As far as net interest income, over 80% of our loans are floating rates and primarily tied to 30-day LIBOR, which declined 37 basis points during the quarter. This impact combined with a growth in interest-bearing deposits, resulted in net interest income of $586 million and a net interest margin of 3.52%. We were able to add $1 billion of swap in September at relatively attractive rates. Our strategy is to build our hedging program over time, closely monitoring the market and taking advantage of market opportunities as they arise. Credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs at 33 basis points. Similar to the second quarter, charge-offs primarily consisted of valuation impairment on select Energy credits, as capital markets for this sector remained soft. Nonperforming assets declined and were only 44 basis points of total loans and the provision decreased to $35 million. A broad-based increase of $6 million in fee income helped offset the more challenging rate environment. We had good growth in commercial lending, card and fiduciary income. As expected, increases in salaries and benefits, along with higher occupancy and technology cost, resulted in $11 million increase in expenses. This is in line with the outlook we have provided for full year expenses to remain flat, excluding 2018 restructuring cost. We reached our 10% CET1 target at the end of the third quarter. We returned $467 million in capital to shareholders through our dividends, which currently provides over a 4% return and by repurchasing 5.7 million shares under our share buyback program. Relative to third quarter of last year, our results reflect our ability to generate solid loan growth of nearly 5%, drive fee income growth and maintain our expense discipline. Last year, very strong credit quality resulted in no provision, while this quarter our provision was more in line with our historical norm. Through active capital management, we have reduced our share count by 13%. Altogether, earnings per share increased 5% year-over-year. Now, I will turn the call to Jim Herzog, who assumed the role of Interim CFO last month. Our search process to identify a permanent CFO is underway. Jim has a wealth of knowledge with over 35 years' experience at Comerica and has been our Treasurer for the past eight years. Jim? Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4, as Curt indicated, average loans were stable in the third quarter with seasonal decreases in National Dealer and general Middle Market, offset by an increase in Mortgage Banker, which also benefited from strong refi volumes. In addition, we had growth in commercial real estate with the largest contribution coming from multifamily activity in California. Total period-end loans were also stable, essentially reflecting the same activity we saw on the average balances. On a year-over-year basis, we've grown loans $2.3 billion, with increases in general Middle Market in all three of our markets. This falls in many of our specialty areas such as Mortgage Banker, Energy, National Dealer Services, commercial real estate, and environmental services. Our loan yields were 4.83%, a decrease of 17 basis points from the second quarter. This was a result of lower interest rates, primarily one month LIBOR, partly offset by an increase in loan fees, and the lease residual adjustment we took in the second quarter that was not repeated. Of note, nonaccrual interest recoveries remain slightly elevated in the quarter contributing $4 million. Slide 5 provides details on deposits. Average balances increased over $700 million with growth across the majority of business lines and in all three of our markets. Noninterest-bearing deposits were stable, while customer interest-bearing balances increased over $800 million. The growth in balances and mix shift to higher-yielding products drove a 5 point increase in our interest-bearing deposit costs. This is at the lower end of the guidance we previously provided. With the decline of interest rates, we've begun to take action to adjust deposit rates, which I will discuss further in a moment. As you can see on slide 6, our MBS portfolio is stable. The yield in the portfolio held steady. The full quarter benefit of higher yield and securities reinvested throughout the second quarter was offset by $600 million we reinvested in the third quarter at yields that were mostly below the portfolio average. Yields on recent purchases have been in the  2.40% (00:09:12) range. The current rate environment has not had a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium, which remains relatively small. Turning to slide 7, net interest income was $586 million, and the net interest margin was 3.52%. Loans had a negative impact of $16 million or 13 basis points to the margin. The major factor was lower interest rates, which had a $26 million impact and 15 basis points to the margin. This was partially offset by one additional day in the quarter, as well as other factors which I previously outlined. Higher balances at the Fed added $2 million, but were offset by the lower yield and combined had a 2 basis point impact on the margin. Growth in interesting-bearing deposits, particularly higher yielding products, increased costs by $6 million or 3 basis points to the margin. Lower rates reduced wholesale funding costs by $5 million and added 3 basis points to the margin. In summary, the net impact from rates, along with higher interest-bearing deposit balances, was partially offset by one additional day in the quarter. Credit quality remains solid, as shown on slide 8. Our net charge-offs were $42 million or 33 basis points, which is well within our historical norm of 20 to 40 basis points. Excluding Energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of portfolio were only 6 basis points. This included strong recoveries of $19 million. While total charge-offs were higher, we do not believe this is the trend. The increase in charge-offs were primarily due to the impairment of select Energy loans. As we indicated last quarter, valuations of a few liquidating Energy assets have been impacted by volatile oil and gas prices and weak capital markets. Nonaccrual loans remained low at $220 million or 43 basis points of our total loans. Criticized loans represent less than 4% of total loans as of quarter-end. As far as Energy, nonaccrual loans decreased $10 million while criticized loans increased $10 million. We increased our reserve for Energy which remains at a very healthy level. Our reserve ratio held steady at 1.27% and resulted in a provision of $35 million, a decline of $9 million from the second quarter. As far as our adoption of CECL in first quarter of next year, we are running parallel tests and remain on track for a successful implementation. Given the relatively short duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and expectation of a fairly benign economic environment, we expect the change in reserves will be plus or minus 5% and, therefore, have little impact on our capital ratios. Turning to slide 9 and noninterest income which increased $6 million. Our continued focus on growing card fees resulted in a $2 million increase. Commercial lending fees also increased $2 million primarily due to strong syndication income. Fiduciary income increased $1 million, mainly due to tax preparation fees and higher asset values. We also had small increases in several other categories, including letters of credit and foreign exchange. Derivative income declined $1 million due to the impact of lower rates on the credit valuation adjustment. Deferred comp asset returns, which were offset in noninterest expenses, were $3 million compared to zero in the second quarter. Expenses were well controlled and our efficiency ratio remained low at 52%, as shown on slide 10. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million as a result of the increase in deferred comps that I previously mentioned, as well as seasonally higher healthcare expense and one additional day in the quarter. Also, technology initiatives drove the $2 million increase in software expense. Occupancy expense increased $2 million mainly due to seasonality. Turning to slide 11, in the third quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares under our share repurchase program, which is nearly 4% of our total shares. On a year-over-year basis, our share count is down 13%. Together with dividends, we returned $467 million to shareholders in the third quarter. Our goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders by way of the buyback, as well as a healthy dividend which currently has a yield over 4%. Turning to slide 12 and the rate environment. We expect lower rates in isolation to have a $35 million impact to fourth quarter net interest income. This includes the full quarter impact from lower rates in the third quarter as well as an anticipated December Fed rate cut, which is consistent with our economist view. Swaps we've added to provide a $1 million and $2 million benefit. Also, we're expecting interest-bearing deposit costs to decrease 3 basis points to 5 basis points with minimal deposit mix shift. While recent economic data has been mixed, the markets are expecting the Fed to cut rates again. We have run our standard model with a 25 basis point reduction in rates and a few different deposit beta scenarios, as deposit rates are a major variable, and will depend on its competition and our need for pricing. The estimated impact of net interest income under these scenarios ranges from $65 million to $95 million over a 12-month period. The ultimate outcome for our net interest income depends on a variety of actors, such as the pace that which LIBOR moves, balance sheet movements and the competitive environment. As Curt mentioned, we added $1 billion in interest rate swaps in September. Together, with the $2.8 billion in swaps we put on in the first half of the year, the average remaining term of the swap bounces at 3.3 years with an average receive fixed rate of 204 basis points. We continue to closely monitor the market. As we previously shared, our strategy is to make steady progress in building our hedging program over time. Slide 13 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average loans to remain stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Seasonality in the fourth quarter typically drives an increase in National Dealer Services and general Middle Market and a decrease in Mortgage Banker. While 70% of our Mortgage Banker volume is tied to purchase activity, we expect that a slowdown in refi volumes will further reduce Mortgage Banker loans. Otherwise, we anticipate growth in several businesses and a small decrease in Energy. Given the strong loan performance so far this year, we anticipate reaching the upper end of our previous projection of 3% to 4% growth in full-year average loans relative to 2018. We also expect deposit levels to be stable. We remain focused on attracting and retaining relationship deposits and our strategies are working. As core relationship deposits grow, we plan to manage down broker deposits. As I discussed a moment ago, lower rates are expected to have about $35 million net impact on net interest income. In addition, we believe the strong third quarter loan fees and nonaccrual interest recoveries are likely to repeat. As far as credit, we expect the provision to be between $25 million and $45 million, which include some potential additional negative migration in the Energy  (00:16:47). We believe we will continue that strong performance in the remainder of the portfolio. Excluding deferred comp income of $3 million, which is offset in expenses, it is difficult to predict, our noninterest income is expected to be relatively stable. We expect modest growth at a number of customer-driven categories which will likely be more than offset by a reduction in syndication fees and fiduciary income from an elevated third quarter levels. With the benefit of the strong third quarter fee income growth, we expect to exceed our previous outlook for noninterest income to grow 1% to 2% on a full year-over-year basis. Expenses are forecasted to increase modestly. We expect to see higher technology costs, primarily related to investments in our Retail Bank and higher outside processing expenses tied to revenue generating activities. In addition, seasonal inflationary pressures impact certain expenses such as occupancy, employee benefits and marketing. On a full year basis, we expect to continue this year expenses to remain stable excluding the restructuring charges we incurred last year. Finally, we are targeting our CET1 ratio to remain about 10%. As we determine the pace of the share buybacks, we carefully consider our expected earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions. Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt to provide some closing remarks. Thank you, Jim. Over our 170-year history, we have managed through many different economic, credit and interest rate cycles. The tone of recent conversations I have had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic and we continue to see slow, steady economic expansion. With this backdrop, we expect to see loan growth in line with or slightly better than GDP next year, as well as modest core deposit growth and continued solid credit quality. Yet with much uncertainty on several fronts, the market is currently pricing in rate cuts. The impact from a possible reduction in interest rates on our net interest income and pension expense combined with inflationary pressures and continued investment in technology provide headwinds, but we believe they are manageable. In addition, our share repurchase program has allowed us to return excess capital and lower our share count, providing a meaningful benefit to our EPS. With our efficiency ratio below 50% and an ROE of 16%, we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control and maintaining our strong performance. We plan to provide a more detailed outlook for 2020 on our next earnings call in January. In closing, we believe our key strengths provide the foundation to drive profitable growth and enhanced long-term shareholder value. Specifically, our geographic footprint which includes faster growing diverse markets combined with our relationship banking strategy is expected to result in growth of loans, deposits and fee income over time. We continue to maintain our proven expense discipline as we invest for the future. Also our conservative, consistent approach to banking including credit and capital management has positioned us well. Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Good morning, Ken. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question, just in terms of slide 12; you provided a $35 million NII impact for a December rate cut. Now, I just checked this morning, it looks like the futures curve is building in a 78% probability of an October rate cut. Can you just provide us the sensitivity if we do get the October cut instead of December, what does that imply for your NII in fourth quarter? Jim? Yeah. Thanks, Ken, and good morning. We do feel it is highly probable we will get a rate cut before the end of the year. It is a little less certain that we will get one in October and the path of LIBOR that we correlate that is also a little less certain. And so, we'd like to go with our economists forecast for the December rate cut. I would point you to slide 12 in terms of some of the sensitivities and  on how (00:21:29) October cut should be somewhat proportional to that. But at this point, we're not providing specific guidance on the October cut just due to the uncertain path of LIBOR. Got you. Okay. I understand. I guess I was just thinking because the futures curve like the probability of a rate cut is actually very high, it might make sense to do that. But I appreciate your answer. I guess maybe a different question. Just in the same slide, the interest-bearing deposit costs going down 3 basis points to 5 basis points. Can you just comment like what are you seeing in terms of deposit cost competition? I know you're going to lag peers. But are peers – from so far what you see in fourth quarter, are they only down in the high-single digits, or like how far are you lagged? I'm just curious on overall deposit competition. Ken, this is Curt, I will take that question. We talked about before that on the way up we lagged increasing our deposit costs. And as we have said, we believe we will lag a little bit on the downside. We do believe that we probably have reached some inflection point and that is why we gave the guidance that we believe deposit cost will come down some in the fourth quarter. It still remains a fairly competitive environment. We have seen some reduction in CD pricing. And we've taken actions on reductions in CD pricing as well. And we're probably starting to see a little bit of reduction in standard prices as well, we'll continue to evaluate. Okay, great. And then, if I can squeeze in one last one, just in terms of the Energy portfolio. Obviously, higher charge-offs this quarter. Can you just talk about where the stress points are? I mean it sounds like your provision guidance does include the probability of additional sizable Energy charge-offs next quarter. Can you just talk about what are the stress points, what are you seeing, is there reason to be concerned more broadly about Energy? Thanks. Pete? Sure. So, our provision forecast, as Jim said – actually charge-offs remain a little bit elevated for the next quarter or two, and that we would see some migration in the Energy portfolio. But at this point, we're not expecting any widespread migration in the Energy portfolio. There is some impact obviously from the weak capital markets and the credits that are on workout area. We expect some of that to result in additional migration in other weaker credits in the portfolio. But overall, we are not expecting this to be a very significant change in credit quality. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ken. Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Good morning, Brett. Hey. Good morning. Wanted to just go back to energy for a second and just talk about the additional weakness that you're anticipating. Is that a function of redetermination season? Did this SNC review have any impact on the portfolio? And then, I know some lenders are changing their reserve base lending tests; does that have a factor in what you're seeing in terms of 4Q as well? Yeah. Well, first of all, the SNC exam really did not have any impact there. What we're seeing is there are certain credits that are, from a liquidation standpoint, a very weak market for. Because of that weak market, these synergies assets are selling at very big discounts. We felt the need to take some additional charges to frame the book value of those assets in line with what we expect the asset sales to actually materialize probably in early 2020. And so, just like last quarter, we took some additional charges there. Again, we're not expecting to see a lot of migration here. Most of our E&P portfolios are very strong credits, we have very strong balance sheets, low leverage, good liquidity. And generally speaking, those credits are less reliant on the capital markets. So, it's really the credits that are more dependent upon that capital markets that we're seeing migration in. Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then the other thing I also wanted to ask about was expenses. Looking at this year versus 2020, I know you haven't given guidance for 2020, but given the rate pressures on the margin, it would seem like your expense focus would be the same or heightens possibly in 2020. Can you give us any high-level thoughts on how you're going to react to margin pressure? And does that mean expenses in 2020 if we're just thinking about operationally you kind of keep things pretty tight and try and manage expenses flattish again or can you give us any additional color on an outlook there? Brett, you're correct in the fact that we're not going to give any more formal guidance on expenses until we get to the end of the year in the fourth quarter earnings call in January. But what I did say in my prepared remarks is that there are a few headwinds that we're aware of in 2020 that primarily would be interest rate related. So, just from a pension accounting standpoint, we'll have some pressure on the pension expense side of things, and then you have sort of the normal inflationary items there and occupancy, et cetera. But as I've said on prior calls, we remain very focused on the expense side of the house, and we will continue to employ the strong expense discipline that we've demonstrated the last several years. So, that remains a high priority for us and the GEAR Up work that we did I think proved our focus on expenses and I think has positioned us well even in a declining rate environment and even with maybe some normal expense pressures that we can manage well even in an environment that we might experience in 2020. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Morning. Good morning, John. On the loan growth outlook, I know, Curt, you had indicated for 2020 the loan growth could be in the – in line or somewhat better than GDP. So, if GDP is in that 2% range, does that imply that you're expecting some potential moderation in loan growth when you look at 2020 versus the 4% level that you're looking at for 2019? Yeah. I'm going to turn in just a moment to Peter Sefzik to give some more specific color commentary. But what I would say is that we saw very strong growth in the first half of the year. And in the third quarter, we alluded to the fact that the Mortgage Banker Finance volume, coupled with refi activity there, helped  for us pretty (00:29:15) stable growth in the third quarter. But at some point, we were sort of anticipating if there is going to be a recession or a slowdown that that might start translating some into loan growth overall and sort of hits the slightly more moderate forecast we're giving for 2020. We'll revise that again at the end of the year when we give a more formal outlook for 2020. But I wanted to give you a little sense of where we think things are headed right now. Peter, I'll let you  (00:29:44) add to that. I think I would just add, you referenced GEAR Up and I think that some of the work that we've done the last few years on the efficiencies for our business have helped us with the loan growth you've seen the last several quarters here, and we're encouraged that that would continue. We feel like the pipeline is still solid across most of our lines of business and feel real good about how things are for the fourth quarter. And I think along the lines of what Curt said for 2020, we're encouraged we'll be able to continue that growth. Okay. All right. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately on the expense side, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of your efforts to remain disciplined on that front in light of the revenue backdrop. Can you help us in terms of how to think about either operating leverage for when you look at 2020 versus generally where you're coming in for 2019 or more specifically the efficiency ratio, how we could think about that trend through 2020 versus what you saw for 2019? Thanks. Yeah. What I would say is that we haven't given any guidance around efficiency ratio or operating leverage for 2020 yet. What we did say at our last conference is that we still believe that overall given the work that we've done, that we can perform well on a relative basis to our peers both in efficiency ratio, ROE, our ROA, etcetera, given the positioning we did relative to GEAR Up. But certainly continued rate decline would have an impact on efficiency ratio on overall returns for the company. But we do believe that we can perform well on a relative basis. Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, do you have the Energy loan loss reserve where it stands? Pete? Yeah. We didn't disclose anything on the Energy or allocation of Energy. I can say though that we have amongst the strongest reserves in the industry and we need to consider, John, that we don't really have any issues in the portfolio ex-Energy. I would say that all those reserves are available to address whatever issues we have in Energy. But I could tell you that we do have a healthy amount of those reserves allocated to Energy at this time. And we probably would have seen a much larger reserve release this quarter except for the fact we did allocate a fair amount of reserves to Energy this quarter. Got it. All right. Thank you. Thank you, John. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Good morning, Peter. Hi. Good morning. Curt, I was looking at slide 12, just going back to that, with the addition of $1 billion in swaps. When I look at the impact estimated net interest income, it's a little bit worse than the second quarter. So, I was just wondering can you just talk about the impact from the swaps and a little bit more details about the plans to reduce asset sensitivity. I might talk a little bit first about the plan to reduce asset sensitivity and then I'm going to turn to Jim to talk more specifically about the impact of the swaps that we added in the quarter. What we had said really on all the calls this year is that we are working towards getting to a larger swap or hedged position over time and that we're going to take a very programmatic and measured approach to get there. There is a real impact to current earnings for adding swaps at these levels or adding hedges at these levels. And so, we have to be careful how we do that and try to recognize the tradeoff between forward forecasts on either rate declines or potential rate increases in future years, but our objective is to get to a larger portfolio. And so, we have a couple of days there where trading was favorable and we were able to move in a larger fashion and add $1 billion worth of swaps, we were not necessarily at that level, every quarter will be sort of measured as we go along. But over time, we want to get programmatically back to a larger position and nothing has changed there. And, Jim, I'll turn to you about that core specifically. Yeah. We did add $1 billion in swaps that will take for a 25 bps shock, about $2 million off of that was sensitivities. As you know, we did have an increase over the second quarter reported sensitivities, and that was largely driven by the fact that we had an increase – a significant increase in deposits – for customer deposits, which does add to our asset sensitivity. So, the net of those did result in a $5 million increase to that 10% deposit beta scenario that you see here. Got it. And then just separately, this quarter, you hit your target on the CET1 ratio. And I'm just wondering any updated thoughts on maybe issuing preferred stock and then using those proceeds to buy back your stock? The preferred continues to be an option that we would consider and it's certainly something that is not only our decision, but it is a discussion we would have with the board. At this time, we are not issuing any preferred stock and we continue to stay focused on the capital stack that we have. We had said all along that we are going to manage down to – so the guidance we've given is to manage down to a 10% level, we came in slightly below that. It's hard to kind of get to the exact number at quarter-end given the number of moving variables. And we'll continue to evaluate for the right capital level going forward and we'll share targets on the fourth quarter earnings call. As we've said previously, there are a number of constituents that we've taken into consideration. Obviously, our shareholders and we want to return capital  (00:35:55) shareholders, rating agencies, regulators, etcetera, but also just making sure that we've got appropriate capital for growth in the company especially on the lending and we continue to be bullish on loan growth opportunities. Okay. Thanks, Curt. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Hi, Steven. Curt, I want to start, so as NIM continues to drift lower, ROE and revenue are both under sustained pressure here. And even once the Fed funds rate stabilizes, it could be years before rates move higher again, you start to get paid on your deposit base. From a big picture view, how do you think about driving shareholder value in this prolonged environment of low rates? Steven, I'm not positive that we're going to have a prolonged low rate environment. And so, I think we could debate sort of the forward month there. I do remain very positive on the US economy overall and what we're hearing both from consumers and businesses, even though there is some caution out there. And so my sort of perspective on this may differ a little bit from yours, the longer term perspective. But having said that, what we had said previously and have reinforced is that we do not anticipate any change to our strategy. And we've been, as I said in my comments, around for 170 years, and we've managed through a lot of different cycles over time both on the credit interest rate and economic perspective. We did some really good work with GEAR Up that I think has positioned us well and allowed us to perform well on a relative basis to our peers. And I believe that we can continue to perform well on a relative basis to our peers. And so, we're focused on the things that we can control. Part of that would be continued focus on organic growth. We're in some great markets and some great lines of business. We've been very focused on new customer acquisitions and continue to be so to driving loan growth and deposit growth and fee income sort of job one. And then secondly is just, as I said earlier, we will continue to work to manage expenses appropriately, keep our expense discipline in place. Pete talked earlier about our credit position, and we believe that we continue to have a very conservative approach to credit, and that has served us well through lots of cycles. And if we do hit a recession, we believe we can perform well on a relative basis and maintain strong credit discipline and credit performance. And then I think we've done a very good job in managing our capital and that remains a top priority in both using our capital to fund growth, but also to return appropriately to our shareholders. And then the things we talked about earlier, we'll continue to make progress on the hedging front which I think will help over time. And as you alluded to at some point, we do believe that that – we're kind of on the verge of that, we'll be able to manage down our deposit cost since we're reaching an inflection point there. So, those are the things that we can control, the things that we're focused on as a company. Okay. That's helpful. Curt, in terms of the CFO search now underway, it's still not cleared to many of us, me included, why Muneera left the company. Is there any color you could share on this? Yeah. I think as we shared in the filings that we did and obviously, Muneera is no longer with us, she did make a lot of very valuable contributions to our company both in the CFO role and I think you know prior to CFO, she was our Chief Accounting Officer for a number of years. I am in the process as you would expect as the new CEO establishing my leadership team. We're very fortunate to have Jim Herzog, who has a lot of experience with our company in the interim CFO role and we have launched a national search for a new CFO. And the last thing I would say on Muneera just to reemphasize what we said in our filling that there's nothing related to Muneera's departure that was any issue, no concerns or disagreement with our company, nothing that should put in the financial operational policy violation, nothing of that nature, whatsoever. And so, we wish her well and remain very appreciative for our service to the bank. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Erika. With your CET1 now at your floor and you noted that you want to work with your current capital stack at this time. How should we think about buyback power from here relative to what you've repurchased in the past? Jim? Yeah. We're pleased that we did hit the 10% target at the end of the third quarter. And from this point forward, our share buyback is really going to be driven purely by a function of supporting the dividend, the capital needed to support loan growth and our earnings capabilities. And if you put all those in the model I think even back into what our share repurchase are going to be, we are in kind of a steady state right now on CET1. So it does make our share repurchase activity a little more predictable, but it's going to be a function of those three factors that I just mentioned going forward. Got it. And as a follow-up to that, is there a way that you could give us guardrails in terms of if rates go down X and what the impact is to the pension expenses? And is that the long end of the curve that we have to be more sensitive to? Yeah. It is the long end of the curve and we do peg it to a AA-rated bonds. So there's a little bit of credit spread in there. And of course, at the end of the year, we re-measure. So, even though interest rates are the biggest factor, there are other factors that go into this, such as various actuarial assumptions on asset returns, how the equity markets performed during the last year. But interest rates are by far and away the biggest determinant. And I think if you look at our published financials from January in the K, we state that there's about a $7 million impact for every 25 basis points of yield movement or discount rate movement. And if you look at a 10-year, that's a pretty good proxy, the duration of our liabilities are a little longer than 10 years and there's a little credit spread in there. But the 10 years is a pretty good proxy for that. And you know we are down almost 100 bps since the last re-measurement date last December 31. So what we'll measure at the end of this year, and we'll put all those factors under consideration and we'll have our new pension expense come January 1. But until then, there's still a lot of movement that can occur with all those different variables. I see. And just if I could slip a last one in here. Curt, I thought Steve asked the question that all your shareholders have been asking us, and I'm sure you, too, in terms of what you're doing to offset the cyclicality. And I'm wondering if I took away the right thing. So, loan growth in your vibrant markets continued efficiency gains, if you will, that have been a result of GEAR Up. And I'm wondering if that's – all of what you mentioned is enough to keep earnings stable, because obviously, part of the underperformance is that the expectation for earnings in 2020 is that earnings are going to be down mostly due to cyclicality and nothing to do with how you're running your business. And I'm wondering if there's – the response is, is there enough in the till to offset that cyclicality in 2020? Erika, we'll give more formal guidance at the January fourth quarter earnings call. But I'd go back and just reemphasize the things that we mentioned previously, this is not the first time that we have made it through an interest rate cycle or even an economic slowdown. And when you have to take into consideration lots of factors including the value of our franchise, the markets that we operate in, our long-term growth perspective, balancing sort of expense reductions coupled with investing in the franchise longer term and sort of the technology evolution that's occurring across the industry, and we also have taken into consideration for the strong credit management. And so, all those things will be things that we continue to weigh and factor in. But you know as an institution that we are asset sensitive and so, certainly, downward rate environment puts more pressure on us from a top line revenue perspective, and then it's our goal to manage around expense side, the credit side, other factors that we can control and certainly to remain very focus on the top line revenue growth. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Thanks. Good morning, Jon. Good morning, everyone. Question for you, I guess, maybe it's for Pete as well. But just to talk about the general Middle Market outlook. You talked a little bit about a slowdown in the prepared comments. And I guess overall view is, is it changed at all since what you saw in the summer? Do you feel like that's getting better? Do you still feel like it's pretty cautious environment? I'm actually going to let Peter answer that  (00:46:05). Peter, if you don't mind. Yeah. I think that it still feels pretty good  (00:46:10) out there is maybe still positive, but maybe not as positive as it was 90 days ago. But our pipeline still look really good, our year-over-year growth for Middle Market has been solid. And we did see in the third quarter, like we typically see some seasonality, but maybe not as much as we have historically. And we're encouraged with what we see going forward. But there are a lot of macro things going on in the world that customers ask questions about. But when you talk to the general Middle Market company, they're busy and we continue to see opportunity. Okay. And then, Curt, you used the phrase optimistic conversations. Maybe help us understand that a little bit as well. Yeah. I think it's really a mirror of what Peter just said, that in general, when I'm out in the markets or any of us are out in the markets with our customers, they're, as Peter said, busy. And I think businesses in general are going well in many of the markets and business lines that we serve. A lot of borrowing is still to meet current working capital, we haven't seen a lot of CapEx spending. Well, we haven't seen a lot of CapEx spending for the last several years, and nothing really has changed there. There's more probably conversations there occurring about sort of where things are going from a macro perspective, whether it's trade-related,  (00:47:43) recession, or just global political issues. But in terms of sort of day-to-day operating, most of our customers are very busy. In fact, some of them have or having challenges, for example, right now, around labor, just having enough staff to meet the current demand. So, not a lot of change there, but maybe a little bit more foreshadowing of concerns about the future, which is part of why we reflected that in some of my comments about 2020 growth. Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one quick one, when you were talking about expenses, you talked – you flagged investments on the Retail Bank. And could you maybe just talk about the magnitude of the expenses there and some of the key areas where you're spending? Thanks. Yeah. As we've said previously, a lot of our GEAR Up initiatives allowed us on the technology front to reorient and reallocate where we were spending money and spend less on sort of core platforms as we jettison some of our aging technology and more  (00:48:48) for new customer and colleague enablement. And we have a very strong retail banking franchise today, and we can have certainly a lot of strong digital capabilities in terms of mobile banking. We were the early banks to adopt the Zelle platform that's going very well. But there are some things that we're doing on the retail front. We just continue to make sure that we are relevant to our customers and that we can be focused on the customer acquisition. On the digital side, you'll see us rollout a new onboarding platform that will be easier for clients to sign up for capabilities of Comerica across a lot of different fronts and sort of speed to revenue and customer onboarding so to speak. So, that's forthcoming. We've done a lot of work around our call center and some new technology there that supports primarily our Retail Bank, but not exclusively and then just within the retail center as well, that continue to adopt the new digital capabilities. For example, we are rolling out tablet capability for all the bankers in the Retail Bank to make them more mobile and interfacing with their clients and just sort of easier interface within the banking center itself. All of those were things that we've had on the roadmap, and we are working hard to manage within sort of our overall current run rate on technology. But some of those do create a little bit of expense pressure for us. But the right things for us to do are longer term to make sure we remain relevant and competitive for our customers. Okay. All right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Gary. Hey. Just had a kind of question on your CECL disclosures on slide 15. I'm curious on the commercial side where you're forecasting kind of flat to down 5% on the reserve. How much volatility is there in that number from the Energy portfolio, particularly if you were to think about the commercial portfolio ex-Energy, where do you think that kind of CECL adjustment would shake out? Yeah. So, couple of things. First of all, from a – the CECL is very dependent upon credit quality and the makeup of the portfolio, as well as the economic forecasts. Energy is just one segment of that and it's a relatively small segment of the entire loan portfolio. So, it would be a factor, but, overwhelmingly, it would be the remainder of the portfolio, the almost $50 billion of other loans that we have that will drive both from an economic forecast and from a credit quality. But Energy would have some impact, obviously. All right. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Curt Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. We appreciate everyone's interest in Comerica. Thank you for joining our call today, and have a great day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's call. Thank you, all, for joining. You may now disconnect."

         "Q3 2019 Earnings Call",
         "Good morning. My name is Samantha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M&T Bank Q3 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Samantha, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events & Presentations link. Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements. Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King. Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's earnings press release, M&T's results for the third quarter include several items that we think are worth highlighting. Total revenues grew from the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, notwithstanding the lower interest rate environment and associated pressures on net interest income. Although we recognized an additional valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights, which reflects higher expected prepayments arising from lower interest rates, we also recorded an impressive increase in mortgage banking revenues. This demonstrates how mortgage loan originations can act as somewhat of a partial hedge for the mortgage servicing business. Loan growth continues to be steady and in line with our expectations for low-single-digit aggregate growth in 2019. Credit quality is consistent with our recent experience with net charge-offs stable at rates well below our long-term average. A further decline in criticized loans was accompanied by an increase in non-accrual loans, primarily the result of one large loan previously reported as criticized. Let's take a look at the specifics. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.47 for the third quarter of 2019 compared with $3.34 in the second quarter of 2019 and $3.53 in the third quarter of 2018. Net income for the quarter was $480 million compared with $473 million in the linked-quarter and $526 million in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.58% and annualized return on average common equity of 12.73%. This compares with rates of 1.6% and 12.68%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in the GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $4 million or $0.03 per share – or per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $484 million compared with $477 million in the linked-quarter and $531 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 for the recent quarter compared with $3.37 in 2019 second quarter and $3.56 in the third quarter of 2018. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.66% and 18.85% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.68% and 18.83% in the second quarter of 2019. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Recall that both GAAP and net operating earnings for the second quarter of 2019 were impacted by a $48 million write-down of M&T's investment in asset manager, which had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The write-down amounted to $36 million after-tax effect or $0.27 per common share. In July 2019, M&T agreed to sell its investment in the asset manager, which had been obtained in the 2011 acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation. The sale was consummated in late September. There were no such noteworthy items in 2019's third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2019, down by $12 million or 1% from the linked quarter. This reflects a narrower net interest margin, partially offset by growth in both loans and total earning assets. The margin for the quarter was 3.78%, down 13 basis points from 3.91% in the linked quarter. Contributing to that decline were several offsetting items. On the positive side, a more favorable mix of interest-earning assets, specifically a higher proportion of loans, added about 2 basis points to the margin. A higher level of cash on deposit of the Fed accounted for an estimated 2 basis points of the decline in the margin. We estimate that lower short-term market rates, primarily LIBOR, accounted for some 8 basis points of the decline. This is consistent with our expectations of a 4-basis point to 9-basis point decline in the margin over the ensuing 12-month period following a hypothetical 25-basis point cut in the fed funds target and by, implication, LIBOR. A higher cost of interest-bearing deposits, primarily mortgage escrow deposits, accounted for approximately 5 basis points of the decline. We continue to see inflows of these escrow deposits, a result of higher prepayment of mortgage loans we service or subservice on behalf of mortgage-backed security investors. Absent the higher level of escrow deposits, the total cost of interest-bearing deposits would have been approximately flat as we manage deposit rates lower. As expected, the migration of deposits into higher yielding categories, notably commercial deposits into interest checking and on balance sheet sweep, has slowed and rates offered on new certificates of deposit have declined. Average loans grew by 1% compared with the previous quarter. Originations remain solid while payoffs and paydowns remain consistent with levels we've experienced in the first half of 2019. Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat compared with the linked quarter, as the usual seasonal softness in loans to auto dealers to finance inventories was offsetting growth in other categories. Commercial real estate loans grew 1% compared with the second quarter. Residential real estate loans declined by less than 0.5% compared with the linked quarter. As was the case last quarter, the continued comparatively steady pace of paydowns of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction was partially offset by higher levels of loans originated for sale. Holding originations for sale aside, we expect the portfolio of acquired mortgage loans to continue its low double-digit rate of principal amortization in future quarters. Consumer loans were up 4% as growth in recreation finance loans continues to outpace declines in home equity lines and loans. There were no particular standouts, positively or negatively, in our community banking regions from a loan growth perspective. From the line of business view, recreational vehicle financing, as well as residential and commercial mortgage banking were particularly strong. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew an estimated 3% compared with the second quarter. This primarily reflects the escrow deposits we referenced earlier. Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $528 million in the third quarter compared with $512 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $137 million in the recent quarter compared with $107 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $835 million in the quarter, up from $723 million in the second quarter, reflecting a new wave of refinancing activity in the face of lower, longer term – in the face of the lower, longer term interest rate environment, as well as seasonal strength. Total mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $88 million in the third quarter; improved from $72 million in the prior quarter. To clarify, that's residential mortgage banking revenue. Thank you, Don. In addition to higher gain on sale revenues, the increase reflects reaching the run rate of the residential loan servicing and sub-servicing that we acquired in the first and second quarters. Commercial banking revenues were $49 million in the third quarter compared with $35 million in the linked quarter, reflecting notably stronger origination activity. The $30 million or 28% increase in total mortgage banking revenues brings with it higher expenses, notably $5 million of compensation costs as well as the $14 million valuation allowance recorded during the quarter on our mortgage servicing rights. Trust income was $144 million in the recent quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter. Recall that the second quarter results include $4 million of seasonal fees earned assisting clients with their tax filings, which did not recur in the third quarter. Trust income continues to grow in the upper single-digit range over the prior year. Service charges on deposit accounts were $111 million, up from $108 million in the second quarter. The recent quarter included $4 million of securities gains, representing valuation gains on equity securities, while the second quarter of 2019 included $9 million of similar valuation gains. Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $873 million compared with $868 million in the prior quarter. As previously noted, the prior quarter's results included a $48 million write-down of our investment in an asset manager acquired in the Wilmington Trust merger. The two most recent quarter's results reflect an addition to a valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights as a result of lower long-term interest rates. Those additions amounted to $14 million and $9 million in the third and second quarters respectively. As noted earlier, those same lower rates have prompted a notable uptick in residential mortgage loan originations and associated gain on sale revenues. Salaries and benefits were $477 million, up $21 million from $456 million in the prior quarter. Contributing to the increase was one extra compensation day in the third quarter amounting to $5 million as well as $5 million of compensation costs arising from the uptick in residential and commercial mortgage loan originations that I just referenced. In addition, the third quarter results include another $10 million of costs that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter, relatively unchanged from 2019 second quarter. The ratios for both quarters include the additions to the MSR valuation allowance, while the second quarter figure includes the write-down of the investment in the asset manager. Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remains consistent with our recent experience given the continued strength of the economy. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 16 basis points for the third quarter, little changed from the 15 basis points in the first half of 2019. Non-accrual loans increased by $140 million at September 30 compared with the end of June, reflecting one large commercial loan to a wholesale distributor that was previously included in criticized loans. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans rose to 1.12% at the end of the quarter. Notwithstanding the increase in non-accrual loans, total criticized loans decreased further from the levels seen at the end of June. The provision for credit losses was $45 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $9 million. The excess provision primarily relates to the non-accrual loan to the wholesale distributor, net of the decline in other criticized loans. The allowance for credit losses increased to $1.04 billion at the end of September compared with $1.03 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The ratio of the allowance to total loans increased by 1 basis point to 1.16%. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $461 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $434 million or 94% were guaranteed by government-related entities. Turning to capital, M&T's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.81% at September 30 compared with 9.84% at the end of the second quarter. The modest 3-basis-point decline reflects the net impact of higher loans, earnings retention and capital distributions. During the quarter, M&T repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $300 million. Now, turning to the outlook, as we enter the final quarter of 2019, our guidance for the year remains little changed from our prior comments. We continue to expect growth in total loans in 2019 to be at the low-single-digit pace with continued run-off in residential mortgages more than offset by aggregate growth in the other loan categories. The reductions in short-term rates implied by the forward curve will continue to pressure both net interest income and the net interest margin. However, we still expect modest year-over-year growth in net interest income for 2019. All else being equal and holding aside volatility in escrow deposit balances and associated cash balances placed at the Fed, each hypothetical reduction of 25 basis points in the Fed funds target should result in 4 basis points to 9 basis points of margin pressure over the ensuing 12 months. The servicing and sub-servicing acquisitions we completed, combined with the strong third quarter origination activity in both our residential and commercial mortgage banking operations, has resulted in mortgage banking revenues growing better than expected, while trust income has been in line with our expectations, growing at a little better than a mid-single-digit pace. We would not expect mortgage banking results for the fourth quarter, either residential or commercial, to match those seen in the third quarter. The remaining fee businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations, growing in the low-single-digit range. Expenses for the year have grown a little more rapidly than we'd previously indicated, driven by two primary factors, growth in the mortgage business; and investments in the bank, notably IT stuff. Higher expenses associated with the servicing and sub-servicing acquisitions as well as from the compensation expense associated with strong mortgage originations activity drove expenses above our initial expectations. We also continue to expect to see some offsets to the year-to-date additions to our IT staff through lower contractor and consulting expenses starting in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter expenses to be lower than the recent quarter. Our outlook for credit remains little changed. While sentiment about a potential recession is building, we are not seeing or hearing signs of a slowdown. Our customers' largest concern is their ability to find enough workers with the right skills to add to capacity. As noted, criticized loans will be down this quarter from the end of June. That said, the specific reserve taken on the wholesale distributor we mentioned could result in a notable charge-off in the coming quarters. Regarding the new loan loss accounting standard known as CECL, we've completed our second parallel run and expect to disclose preliminary results in the third quarter 10-Q. To preview those results and based on the current economic forecast, we'd expect the allowance for losses on loans and leases to increase by approximately 5% to 15% upon adoption of the accounting standard. That, in turn, should result in an impact to our capital ratios of less than 10 basis points. Regarding capital, we expect to continue to execute the capital plan that was previously outlined. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. Now, let's open up the call to questions. Before which, Samantha will briefly review the instructions. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Morning. Good morning, John. On the expense outlook, I just want to get an idea. I know you had indicated that the fourth quarter expenses should not – it should be down from the third quarter level, just trying to understand how we should think about the magnitude of that decline. I know your previous expectation had been that the second half expenses would be similar to the first half, so that would imply – if that still holds, that will imply a pretty sharp drop-off in fourth quarter. So, just want to get an idea what type of decline we can expect. Thanks. Sure. So, as we look at the fourth quarter and think about some of the things that happened in the third quarter, I'll start with that. The mortgage business obviously had a great quarter and there was about $20 million of expenses associated with that, which we didn't account for, to be honest, because we weren't sure where rates were going to be when we gave the guide. And so, that $20 million is, I would just going to add it to the guide. But let's not forget that there is $30 million of revenue that came along with that. And then there was about $10 million of expenses that we recognized in the third quarter that I don't foresee reoccurring in the fourth. And so, we're – at that point, we're a little bit above what the guide was, but we wouldn't expect things to be necessarily equal in terms of each quarter in the second half being exactly the same. So, we think that there's some room for the expenses to come down and get down to the level that would have been implied, on an average basis, in the guide that we gave before. Okay. And then on that same topic, on the – you mentioned that obviously the higher mortgage-related costs were a factor, but also higher costs than you had expected in your technology investments. Can you give us a little more color there? What surprised you there and how much should we think about that when we look at 2020 and if it could be a factor again as you forecast expenses going out? Thanks. Sure. I guess in the IT space, there's a few things, some which I would describe as timing-related in the quarter. One you see in the other software – or other processing and software line where there's some annual licensing expenses that came in in the quarter. We wouldn't expect those to repeat. When you look in the other costs, that's where a lot of the professional services expenses. And in there, we'd talked about before the pace at which the contractors roll off as the new staff comes on. And there are some projects that extended maybe 30 days or 45 days, a little bit longer than we thought to bring them to completion. We've seen those roll off as we get to the end of the quarter, and that's why we feel confident that we'll actually start to see that – the impact of the adds to staff and the reduction in contractors as we go into the fourth quarter and start to recognize that into 2020. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Ken. Actually, just had a quick question. In terms of the mortgage banking business, obviously with the servicing that you've taken on, obviously this quarter was a really good result. But if we think about the ongoing run rate from this, I know you said fourth quarter is probably not going be as high as 3Q, but what is kind of the right level? If that's – if you can kind of sort of pick a number. I'm just trying to get a sense, are we at some meaningfully sustainably higher level given the servicing assets? Thanks. Sure. So, we're definitely at a higher level than where we would have been if you compared to the third quarter of last year. So, the third quarter of this year would reflect pretty much a full quarter's run rate of both the servicing rights that we acquired as well as the subservicing, and that should be fairly stable. Of course, servicing is a declining asset and so the fees come down a little bit each quarter based on the unpaid balances. And then, really, the volatility that we wouldn't expect to repeat, but is also a bit of a function of rates, is just the origination activity. And right now, I'm talking specifically on the residential side. Now, one of the things that does tend to happen when you buy servicing rights is, as you take the impairment or set up the allowance for prepayment, when those things prepay, oftentimes it shows up down the road in gain on sale. And that was part of the uptick in this last quarter. In the commercial space, we had just a fantastic third quarter. I think it was the highest origination quarter in our history in commercial mortgage, driven off the origination. I think you saw a lot of activity in the marketplace where rates had come down and where there was some concern about the amount of business that Fannie and Freddie might do. Towards the end of the quarter, they reaffirmed their appetite for the coming five quarters, so probably take a little bit for the pipeline to rebuild, but it should be a solid quarter but what I would consider a more normal rate of gain on sale in the commercial mortgage space versus what we saw in the third quarter. And those are really what was part of our comments about some of the things that were a little bit outsized in the mortgage business in the third quarter of this year was really about originations as opposed to servicing. And servicing should be pretty consistent as we go from here. Okay, great. And then can you just remind us like what is the dollar amount roughly that the acquired servicing and the subservicing rights contributed to this quarter's earnings? When we talked about it at – in March, we talked about an additional $60 million of servicing revenue for the year with it kind of building and peaking in this quarter. So, we're probably in the range of $17 million to $20 million, somewhere in there, maybe a little – maybe closer to $17 million than the $20 million in terms of what the run rate is on that acquired servicing. I guess I'll just – I'll reiterate that you earn a fee based on the unpaid principal balance and each month those decline as people make their payment. So, as those decline, that fee income will move down at a similar pace. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Hi, guys. I just want to follow up on expense a little bit. It's been a pretty busy day. Just as I kind of try to add in the comments that you made about expenses in the fourth quarter backing up the $30 million and kind of come into the maybe average of what you think before, what does that imply for 4Q dollar expenses if we do that math? I guess if you do the math and you look at what we would have implied in the guide, it would have been right around $830 million, $835 million a quarter. And you're probably in that range for the fourth quarter. Okay. And then – that's helpful. And then, a follow-up, it was asked earlier, but as you think about the underlying expense growth at the company, obviously mortgage was unusually high and you talked to some lumpiness in the investment, but as you think about kind of whether it's full-year 2020 or a medium-term underlying expense growth, where is that? And what I'm getting to, kind of the next question, is I think there is some concern that banks your size may not have some of the scale that you need and that's why we're seeing some expense pressure versus the big guys so much. And obviously, with the rate headwind out there pressuring revenues on that side, it's just more magnified potentially. So, if you can just address those two – those topics. Thank you. Yeah, I guess – trying to remember them all. You said a lot there, man. The – I guess, overall, when you look at the expenses at the bank, this year was a year of expense growth. It was very atypical for M&T. Obviously a bunch of it was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we acquired. That was $40 million. We've so far added about $22 million to the allowance, the valuation allowance, which we might not have anticipated when we first agreed to acquire those loans back almost a year ago. And so, those have driven the expenses up. And then the other thing that's been happening, obviously, is the investments we're making to change the way we deliver IT at the bank. And I think IT is probably one of the big things that is talked about in terms of scale. And what we're doing is I think we're positioning ourselves to actually better compete with our competitors, both regional and large national players, by the investments that we're making. And so, by shifting more of the resources, more of the team, the IT team on staff, we think we can increase capacity in terms of what we're able to deliver for the same expense base. And that's part of why we're making that move and also, the move to more agile approaches, which should bring new capabilities to market a little more quickly than what we may have done in the past. And so, part of the shift is to make sure that we're competitive, and – but in the time that you're building that capability, you've got other projects going on. And we've talked a little bit before about the kind of double expense that you incur while you're making that transition. It will happen a little bit each quarter as we go through that, but we'll start to see some of the payoff of that in the coming quarters, and we think we'll start to see it in the fourth quarter with the professional services cost going down. And so, when you think about where expenses are and have been for M&T over time, and we'll give you our thoughts on 2020 when we get to January, but really when you look at M&T through time, we've been a low nominal expense growth player, generally kind of 2% a year or less, and we certainly think that we're in an industry where that's warranted and we think about that all the time. And given the growth this year in investments that we've made, we'd love to see if we can be in or below that range as we go into 2020. But like I said, we'll give you more details on that in the January call. But I don't think we need to run at this kind of expense rate on an ongoing basis. And we absolutely have some ways to improve productivity based on the investments that we've made, which will help us stay competitive. And obviously, we'll react to the changing rate environment, which we've done successfully in the past. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning. Just wondering on the – if you could, Darren, if you can give a little more color on the credit that moved into non-accrual in the quarter in terms of industry, geography, collateral. Any color you could give would be interesting. Thanks. Yeah, sure. And obviously, we're not going to talk about specific customers per se, but when we look at this one customer, they're a wholesaler and so some of the financing is tied to inventory and receivables. And they've had some challenges internally with their management, and that put them in a bit of a cash bind. And that's why we kind of moved it from criticized into non-accrual. And the question will be the value – ultimate value of the receivables and collectability of those, as well as the inventory. We obviously don't think it's zero, but we do expect that there will be likely some loss on that as we work our way through. Obviously, given the magnitude of this relationship and the industry it was in, we went through all of our relationships over $100 million, which fortunately I can count them on both hands, and looked through them and they are not in similar industries and are, in fact, quite healthy. And we looked through for other wholesaler and distributor-type relationships and we didn't find any others that had this similar situation. So, when I look through the loans that went into criticized through the first and second quarter, this was one of them. When we talked about it at the time, we looked for any common themes in those criticized loans, either in terms of industry, geography or the like and we couldn't find anything other than they tended to be situational, specific and oftentimes related to management. And I would describe this as in that same ilk. Okay. And then, as a follow-up, you clearly mentioned you're not seeing broader weakness in credit. Just wondering if there's any areas that you're seeing as becoming more frothy areas you guys are shying away from in your various geographies. Nothing in particular. We've obviously – we've paid a lot of attention all the way along to some of the office space, à la things going on recently in the industry, but we don't have much there. When we look around, there is nothing in particular that I would point to that is what I would describe as very frothy. There continues to be lots of competition for lending. Pricing seems to be fairly reasonable. When I look at our spreads, they've been fairly consistent for the last three quarters. They did drop after tax reform. You kind of saw a resetting of the industry. You saw resetting of margin after tax reform, but that's stabilized since then. And overall, things seem really good. Structures haven't really changed much from what we've been dealing with over the last few quarters. And as we look, obviously, New York City is a place we pay a lot of attention to and we don't see anything there that causes us concern. So, nothing is really standing out right now, which always makes you wonder what's going to pop. So, we're working to – continuously looking through the portfolio to see where there might be signs of weakness, but at this point, there's no one geography, industry or loan type be it C&I, permanent mortgages, construction where we have any concerns. Okay. All right. Thanks for the color. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Darren, can we talk a little bit more about the net interest income? I heard your comments about the year-over-year growth expected still for 2019, but to the point about the cuts that have already happened and your guidance about what a cut does, the 4 basis points to 9 basis points on a full-year basis, can you help us understand the pushes and pulls with just the remaining burden from the cuts and then the excess liquidity in terms of how you expect the NIM to traject from here in terms of magnitude of compression as you look to the fourth? All right. It's a bit of a moving target these days, isn't it, Ken, with the... Yeah. ...peaks of LIBOR and where the Fed might go? And that's really why we try to help give you guys the guide by talking about the 4 basis points to 9 basis points. That way, you guys can figure out what you think the rate curve might look like. But I guess a couple things that I think are important when we talk about the margin and the net interest income. When you look over the last two quarters at the margin compression, the print doesn't sound – doesn't seem great obviously, but when you look at net interest income, it was down $9 million last quarter and down $12 million this quarter. And when you look at some of the things going on underneath, that might take you beyond the 4 basis points to 9 basis points, you look at increases in cash balances and the cash balances carry a positive spread, albeit small. So, they don't harm net interest income, but they certainly harm the margin. And you would see the same thing with the escrow balances that have grown last quarter and this quarter as well that they're basically slightly positive, in some cases, slightly negative carry. And so, they don't have much of an impact on NI and net interest income, but they do on the margin. And so, as we look forward, the 4 basis points to 9 basis points per 25 basis points seems fairly reasonable to us. The actual margin will move around a little bit depending on what happens with escrow balances, which can be as much a function of the rate environment and prepayment as well as other cash balances at the Fed. So, there's a bunch of pieces that are moving there, but at its core, it's 4 basis points to 9 basis points. The one thing that I think is encouraging is we've started to see deposit costs bend over. If not for the escrow balance growth this quarter, we would have seen the increase in interest-bearing deposit costs be basically zero and we would start to see some traction on repricing activities as we go into the coming quarters, which will help moderate the impact of any further decreases in LIBOR. But it still keeps you within that 4 basis points to 9 basis points range as we go forward. And then... Okay. Yes. Yeah. So, I guess my follow-up would just be then to your point about the modest downward trajectory of NII dollars. Is that the trajectory that you'd still expect given – and I hear you on all the moving parts of it, but – that we still just have to expect that modest slide in NII as you go forward from here or is there something that can change with regards to that trajectory? The trajectory, it might move around a little bit in any given quarter depending on the pace of deposit repricing, but those are over the – over a 12-month average is kind of the 4 basis points to 9 basis points. And obviously, the biggest driver is just LIBOR and how fast LIBOR moves down and how many rate cuts we get. The most of the two we had this quarter are in there. There's probably a little bit of residual from the last cut just because of when it happened in the quarter, but – so, we'll see some of that in the fourth quarter. And then, we'll see what happens with the LIBOR and the Fed over the coming meetings. Okay. Last quick one. Just you'd mentioned that – how much higher are the escrow deposits price versus, I guess, the average interest-bearing deposits at  85% (00:42:30), to your point that the  85% (00:42:42) would have been closer to flat without the escrow? So, can you just give us a understanding of the difference between where the escrow deposits are coming on versus where your kind of average is underneath? Thanks. Yeah. Sure. So, round numbers, when you look at the escrow balances, they're priced off an index either off of Fed funds or off of LIBOR, so they're kind of around  180 (00:43:02) these days. And when you look through the rest of the portfolio, it's primarily commercial interest checking that is driving the interest expense on that line. And within there, there's a range of rates. Those are individually negotiated with each customer based on the relationship and the magnitude of it. And my recollection is that the average there is around 70 basis points, 75 basis points. So, they probably double in terms of what the escrow balances are earning versus what the other ones are. The nice thing about the escrow balances is because they are linked to the index, as the index moves, so too does the cost of those. Understood. Thank you, Darren. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Steven, your line is open. Hey, Darren. Steven, you might have yourself on mute. Okay, your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Well, thank you. I wanted to touch base with you just to summarize these moving pieces because when you think about your expenses, you really have, one, the mortgage valuation, if I'm getting it right, in other expenses. Typically, that kind of gets netted out in revenues, so you wouldn't see that grossed-up expense. So, that's driving your expenses higher this particular year. You've got this transition going from external technology support to internal technology support, so right in the middle of that doubling up of expenses. You're seeing the benefit of those two things rolling off as you kind of guided towards a $40 million to $50 million reduction in expenses as you go from the third to fourth quarter. As you go into next year, if you kind of take that dynamic forward, it seems like your expenses could actually drop as you go into 2020 once you get the benefits of not having the external tech spend and you don't have the, let's say, the long-term rates are flat, so you don't have this valuation situation. So, I guess, if you look forward, Marty, I think the way you're thinking about it is exactly the way we're seeing it and thinking about it. And really, the only thing that would be a timing difference on when we might see the expenses actually drop versus the growth rate drop very dramatically. The latter, we're definitely expecting to see actual decrease. We've still got the transition going on with that tech team. That's going to continue through 2021. And so, we're looking to bring on a large number of folks and they've come on in chunks of probably 100 to 150. And that kind of happens consistently over maybe a quarter to every four months. And when you're in that time period, you're bearing the double costs. And so, we started down that path. We did our first wave this year. Probably took us a little bit longer to get up to speed and a little bit longer to get some of the contractors up than we might have anticipated going on – or going into it, but we're getting smarter how we do that and better able to match the timing. So, we shouldn't carry quite as long as we did this year, but we will continue to see that – the cost of that transition happen through 2020 and really start to see the benefit in 2021. On the mortgage side, like you pointed out, that stuff should wash itself out. And as we go through 2020 compared to 2019 and the mortgage portfolio holding the valuation reserve to the side, that should start to normalize itself and the expenses will obviously move in relation to how the unpaid balances are performing. And then when we watch some of the other costs and some of the other professional services, there were some other activities that we had going on this year that we wouldn't expect to repeat. And so, those should help expenses. The offset there is just compensation costs for folks that have been added to the team. And once you give people raises, that raises your run rate and you got to offset that. So, there's couple things going on back and forth, but when you think high level over the next couple years, the way you're thinking about it, Marty, is exactly the way we're thinking about it. And then on the credit side because, really, the variances in this particular quarter, in my mind, are expenses and then up in the credit side. The $9 million you have put into the allowance and you put some into it last quarter as well, is that covered what you expect to see in the charge-off from this large relationship that might get charged off in the next couple of quarters? So, have you kind of prefunded that? And so when we see the event, you'll actually just be drawing down reserves to pay off the expected loss? So, what happened there, Marty, was that loan was obviously criticized before and we started a reserve for it at that point. There were some other criticized loans that either paid off or became performing, and so what we had put aside for them helped cover the increase in the one that went non-accrual and then we added to it. And so, based on what we know today, it's in the provision and we feel good about it. But this one is a little bit more of a fluid relationship just because of the nature of the collateral. And so, depending on how things move with that organization, the collateral values could move around a little bit on us. And that's why we moved it to non-accrual and why we set up or added to the provision or added to the reserve and let you guys know that we'll probably have something in the future. But the exact magnitude and timing is still a little bit unclear. But outside of that, as you point out, criticized coming back down and the rest of the portfolios, and we look at the delinquencies and what the – what has been happening with the charge-offs, knock on wood, everything has been fairly stable and predictable. And all else equal, one would expect that as rates come down, that would help debt service coverage ratios and customer's ability to pay, which wouldn't lead you to believe that the charge-offs might tick up. The counterargument, obviously, is if GDP slows and growth slows that while the interest cost might come down, you got to keep an eye on revenues and the ability to service the debt from that side of the equation. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo. Thank you. I have a balance sheet question and a tech follow-up question. So, for the balance sheet, the long-term debt has been trending down for the past three to four years. Is that going to stabilize? Or do you think that can continue to run off as your liquidity it's kind of get – kind of smooth out unless you have another deal? Okay. So, if you look at the long-term debt, it's been coming down, but there's been a bit of an uptick in short term. And then, obviously, an uptick in some of the deposit balances in the last little while, particularly driven by escrow. And so, the mix of long term and short term, we will now start to re-evaluate given that LCR has – the ruling has been finalized. So, we were kind of using more short-term borrowing to manage the liquidity coverage ratio and our investments in HQLA while we were waiting for the rule to be finalized. And so, now that there's little bit more certainty there, we'll look at how much securities balances we want on the balance sheet and look at the funding mix of those. But we've also got some long-term debt that is going to roll over next year and, obviously, we'll look to replace that, but subject to where we see the balance sheet going. But we think we've got some opportunity there to manage the securities portfolio now that the rules have been finalized and given how we feel about the strength of the organization. And regarding tech, so I believe when I talked to you in the past, it's around 10% or so of your revenues are spent on technology. It's around maybe a little bit less than $700 million with about 60/40 run the bank, change the bank. And as you bring more staff in-house, do you see either one of those changing? No. I guess, we haven't – I don't think disclosed or talked about what the tech budget is in specifics. I think that the 10% to 12% that you might be referencing is we talked about the compound annual growth rate of that part of the budget. And then, the mix between kind of run the bank versus improve the bank, build the bank, whatever you want to describe, 60/40 is probably a reasonable estimate. It can move around from year-to-year depending on what's going on, when we're making investments in new regulations like FDIC 370 or CECL. I don't know whether we would call that build the bank or run the bank. We're probably splitting hairs there. But at the end of the day, the total tech budget in the short term is running a little bit higher because of the transition that we're making. Our belief is that we will, all else equal, be flat a bit more on staff and less contractors as we go forward. And then, the growth rate from there wouldn't need to be at the 10% to 12% rate, but would probably continue to run at a rate slightly above the bank average. And that the investments we're making in technology would be offset by cost reductions somewhere else as we gain productivity improvements from the tech spend. And the new staff that you're bringing on, are they focused on, besides the FDIC and CECL, digital delivery, AIML, back office cloud as well as the transitioning apps to the cloud? Where are you putting the new office to work? Well, we've got a whole host of things that we're working on. A bunch of them you named. Obviously, some of the regulatory changes have been a big consumer of our tech team this year as we get ready for FDIC 370 and CECL. But at the same time, we've been making consistent investments in a lot of the systems that are used either by our customers or by our employees who interact with our customers. We've been doing that in the commercial loan origination space. We've been doing it in the treasury management and merchant space, in the commercial part of the bank. We've been doing it in some of the M&A support that we do in our institutional client services business. We've been doing it in customer-facing things, both in our wealth management business as well as in the consumer business. We continue to make investments in cybersecurity, in data. And so, it runs a whole host. We are starting to migrate some applications to the cloud. Some of the newer ones often run on the cloud and we're doing some of that. So, we've got a host of – a whole range of places where we're investing. But it always kind of starts with the customer and works backward and looks at where we in the competition and where we need to make sure we're positioning the bank and then also looking for ways that we can obviously improve productivity or efficiency. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. I think it's a little – it's easy to get lost because it hits so many line items and everything has a lag and timing issues. And I guess if you just step back, like was this a good acquisition? Like, accretion or return on invested capital, however you want to measure it. If you just set aside the quarter-to-quarter stuff and where rates are and these escrow deposits, like does this all work? Ask that again, Brian, the first part of it we missed. Just the mortgage servicing, like it's hard to really parse apart everything. Like if you just think about it on a net basis, has the acquisition and the resulting business it built, did it work? Is it accretive? Is it going to be good for 2020 or is there some underlying slippage? It's just hard to – there's so many moving parts and hits so many line items. Sure. I think the short answer is we are still happy with the acquisition of the mortgage servicing rights. It's probably not quite the return that we thought when we first did it and that's affected by the timing of some of the charges that we're taking. But overall, we feel it's accretive and above our long-term cost of capital, which is how we kind of evaluate everything. So, we had some wiggle room built in, which we always do given the volatility of this business. And when we look at it, to your point, stepping back, we still feel good about it and are happy we did it. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Hi, Darren. Good morning, Gerard. A quick question. There seems obviously to be concerns about your IT spending and maybe not keeping up with some of the bigger banks. What measure would you recommend investors look at to show that you are as competitive as the big banks? Obviously, the big banks can be splashy with the dollar signs that they're spending and yours will be a lot less because you're a smaller bank. But is deposits the preferred area to look as your deposit growth year-over-year was better than many of the big banks, but can you share with us what we should be looking at? Sure. It's a great question, Gerard. I guess I think the best place to look at is customer-based measures. So, I would look at customer growth rates, customer attrition rates, satisfaction rates. So, it could be J.D. Power, could be Greenwich in the commercial and small business world, could be some of those early research in the well space. But I mean at the end of the day, the number one thing you're investing in technology for is to help provide a great experience for your customers and make sure that you're on par with everyone else on things that are just kind of what we would call  hygienics (00:59:37) or expected and look for places where you can differentiate what you're doing. And one of the things to keep in mind when you compare the regional banks to the large ones is the large banks have broader-based businesses than we do. We don't have trading operations, for instance, which would consume a lot of dollars. And I can't speak for everyone else, but what I can speak for M&T is, through all the acquisitions that we've done, we've never maintained duplicate systems. And so, we're not carrying that expense and we don't need to incur the cost of running them or consolidating them. And so, a lot is made of how much you spend. I think most important is are you giving your customers the tools and capabilities and services that they're looking for? And they let you know all the time, you can kind of look at deposits, as you pointed out, Gerard. The only think you just got to watch for, in my opinion, on deposits is you can move the deposit balance number with rates a lot faster than you can with technology. And the one that's really hard to fake is transaction accounts or operating accounts, whether they're consumers, small business or commercial entities. And when we think about our tech investments, we're always thinking about those parts of the customer experience and how we can make it better. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess I want to parse through a lot of the moving parts around the NIM guidance, Darren, and try to figure – try to put a dollar sign around it. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty about rates and what not, but 4 basis points to 9 basis points of NIM's pressure for every 25-basis-point reduction in the short-end looks like the fourth quarter one-month LIBOR, the average should be, I don't know, I probably have to sharpen my pencil here, but maybe 40 basis points, 50 basis points lower than what it was on average in the third quarter, especially if we see an October cut. I mean 4 basis points to 9 basis points, I mean it seems like – is it fair to say that it's going be hard not to see some degradation and reduction in net interest income in the fourth quarter on a nominal dollar basis versus what you – like you posted in the third quarter? Yeah. I think that's right. So, the actual margin, you've got the math right in looking at where Fed funds and LIBOR might be over the quarter. The NIM – the print of the NIM might move around a little bit from that depending on where cash balances end up and how much more escrow comes on. But you're in the right ballpark. And then, when you look at the dollar impact, it's going to come down. So, when you look at the guide that we've given, I think you should be able to figure out where we think it's roughly going to be in the fourth quarter. And the other wild card is deposit re-pricing, but like we mentioned, we feel good about the progress that we made this quarter in fending over deposit pricing and we should start to see that come down this quarter. And then, the other thing that's a little bit tricky to gauge is just the pace of loan growth in the quarter, in particular because the fourth quarter always seems to have some uptick. And then, the question there is when does it occur, right? Right. You should start to see it a little earlier in the quarter in the floor plan, auto floor plan balances, but oftentimes, we see a big December and you kind of wonder what drives seasonality. It's yearend and people looking to close deals for the tax year and we always seem to see a spike in some of the loans that book in December and obviously, that will, depending on the timing, impact the dollars of net interest income. Got it. I guess if I could just get one more in, a little bit more of a broader question. The downside of having sort of best-in-class profitability, efficiency, deposit franchise is that it does leave you more vulnerable when the environment starts to turn a little bit worse. I guess the question is just how do you think about sustaining profitability and creating value in that environment? How you think about opportunities where you can grow? And I guess the jist of the question, though, is can you do that on a standalone basis? Can you really – or you need to do something more strategic to really be able to sustain sort of the best-in-class type of profitability and operating metrics you have? I appreciate the question, because it's a really good one. And the strength of the franchise, as you pointed out, is both a blessing and a curse. And when you look at how we run the bank and how we think about the bank, we've always started with returns. And so, to talk about the returns, I was pleased to hear you say that because that's our focus. And that thought process is what has kept us out of trouble and what has helped us make a lot of the investment decisions that we've done through time. And sometimes it was acquiring servicing or subservicing business because the returns made sense based on what was going on in the industry. It's helped us decide when to make loans and how to structure them because if the returns don't make sense to us, we tended to step away. And it's helped us price acquisitions and make sure that we're being thoughtful with capital and how we deploy it to grow with mergers and acquisitions. And so, when you look overall, one of the key things for us is making sure that we maintain those returns. And if that means we need to be patient in time and have a little bit less growth, we're okay with that because we would rather make sure we protect the profitability and the ability to generate capital so that we can make some of the investments that we're making. And if you look at really the last 12 months to 18 months, we had some outsized increases in the net interest margin because of the positioning of the balance sheet and the runoff of the Hudson City portfolio, which allowed us to grow the loans, deploy capital, and increase the margin. And we took advantage of that and we upped the investment that we were able to make in the franchise. So, the reverse is true in that as we see rates come down and our net interest margin relative to the peers kind of resumes its more normal position of slightly above the median, we should be able to bring and anticipate bringing the expenses down commensurate with that. So, you kind of – you look across the different alternatives that you have of making loans, investing in other businesses, buying other banks, or deploying excess capital to shareholders, and think about the returns. Obviously, the first place we want to invest is in the business and in our customers. And this year, we've been able to do that a little bit more with the loan growth that you've seen. And we think we can continue to do that. But I – we don't feel pressure to have to get to a certain size or to buy some growth or – either in the form of poor pricing or in poorly or ill-conceived acquisitions. We will continue to focus on returns and being patient and making sure that we're running a good bank. And that will leave us, we believe, with opportunities when they present themselves. All right. Thanks so much. We really appreciate it. There are no further questions. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Don MacLeod for any additional or closing remarks.

         "Welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erin and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to David Ritchie. David, you may begin. Thank you, Erin. Good afternoon. This is David Ritchie, President and CEO of American River Bankshares, the parent company of American River Bank, headquartered in Rancho Cordova, California. I'm joined by Mitch – with Mitch Derenzo today, our CFO, to give you our third quarter update. Please be aware that two press releases went out as the market opened today: our earnings release, which details our quarterly results; and a cash dividend that will be paid next month. As always, we do include some economic data in our press release and general positive trends in our market, and in California and the nation as well. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mitch to give you an in-depth conversation about our financial results. Thanks, Dave, and of course, thanks to all of you for taking the time in listening to the call today. As you know, before we get started, I need to remind everyone of our Safe Harbor disclosures. Certain matters discussed in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the federal securities laws and may involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and in the subsequent reports filed on 10-Q and 8-K during 2019. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, which would include information or future events, except as required by law. If you go to our website, americanriverbank.com, you can find the link to this Annual Report in our Form 10-K. As with past conferences, I'm going to highlight some of the key areas from our press release that was issued this morning, try to provide some additional details and analysis, then turn it back to Dave for some additional comments, then we'll open up the lines for questions. This morning, American River Bankshares reported net income for the third quarter 2019 of $1.6 million compared to $1.2 million during the third quarter of 2018. That's a 36% increase. Earnings per share were $0.27 per share in the third quarter of this year compared to $0.20 in the third quarter 2018. That's a 35% increase. ROA and ROE for the quarter were 88 basis points and 7.65%, respectively, compared to 68 basis points and 6.37%, respectively, one year ago. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4 million in 2019. That compares to $3.8 million one year ago. Earnings per share for 2019 were $0.68 compared to $0.64 in 2018. ROA and ROE for the nine months of 2019, 77 basis points and 6.81% this year, compared to 74 basis points and 6.95%, respectively, one year ago. On a pre-tax, pre-provision basis, net income was $5.9 million in 2019 compared to $5.1 million in 2018. That's a $791,000 increase or 15.6%. Last quarter, I talked about how it was difficult to compare the second quarter of 2019 with the second quarter of 2018 because we really didn't start adding the additional Relationship Managers and the Chief Credit Officer into the second quarter of 2018. So I think this year, the third quarter of 2019 compares better to the third quarter of 2018. In addition, I think the trailing four quarters are also pretty useful to review to really exceed the progress we've made. And let me give you those numbers there as well. So, net income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.125 million. That increased slightly to $1.146 million in the first quarter of this year. And in the second quarter of this year, we went up to $1.276 million and now to $1.571 million in the third quarter of this year. So, that's a nice trend. EPS is showing the same trend. We had $0.19 in the fourth quarter last year, up to $0.20 in the first quarter of this year, to $0.22 in the second quarter of this year, and now, to $0.27 we're reporting for the third quarter of this year. While those increases are nice, we're not getting too excited because we still have quite a bit of work to do and I think we're heading in the right direction and the numbers are starting to show it. We'll continue to add new relationships. We're increasing our deposits. We're shifting the assets from investments in higher yielding loans, and that's had a nice impact on our net interest income. The net interest income increased from $5.3 million in the third quarter last year, up to $5.9 million in the third quarter of this year. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $15.1 million in 2018. That's up to $17.1 million in 2019. I talked about the shift from investments to loans. Loans were up $60 million or 19.2% from one year ago, and for 2019 they're up $51.4 million or 16.1%. That's really helping the daily interest income. The net daily interest income, that was $60,130 in the fourth quarter last year, increased up to $61,655 in the first quarter of this year to $61,846 in the second quarter and now we're at $64,435 in the third quarter of this year. Of course, the loan growth is requiring a higher loan provision. We added $180,000 in each of the first two quarters this year and then $120,000 in the third quarter. That compares to $0 in the first two quarters of last year, and then $50,000 in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter of 2019 also benefited from $72,000 in loan recoveries that allowed us to not have to add as much to the allowance to expense in the third quarter of this year. Moving to the balance sheet, loans increased $11.5 million during the third quarter. That's a 3.2% increase. Third quarter, we funded $33.1 million in new loans, and that's our sixth consecutive quarter of $30 million-plus loan fundings. The trailing over those past six quarters is $209 million. Unused commitments at the end of September were $37 million. About $12 million of that's commercial. Loans will both have the ability to revolve, but most of the rest of that $37 million is real-estate related, and we're expecting those to fund over the next year or so. On the payoff, those continue to be manageable. We were just under $13 million in the third quarter. That's about the same amount that was in the payoffs in the second quarter of this year. The good news is that we're retaining those loans. The tough part is that we're not getting prepayment fees like we did last year. We collected just $29,000 in prepayment fees in the third quarter of this year, compared to $78,000 in the third quarter last year. But then on a year-to-date basis, we had $157,000 in 2019. That's down significantly from the $434,000 year-to-date 2018. If you take that difference in the year-to-date prepayment fees, that's $277,000, and then you take the year-to-date difference and the additions to the loan – lease loss allowance of $430,000, that's $707,000. So those items benefited 2018. We didn't get repeats for those in 2019. I guess my point I'm trying to make is despite those 2018 benefits, 2019 net income is still exceeding that of 2018 with those benefits. On the credit quality, really, pretty much a repeat of what I said last quarter. I have nothing to discuss here. We don't have any non-accrual loans, and there was no loans 30 days or greater past due at September 30, 2019. I did mention the addition of $120,000 to the loan loss allowance through the provision. Really, that's due to loan growth. The allowance is now 1.32% of loans at September 30. During the quarter, we did have the $72,000 loan recovery. There was no loan losses. Year-to-date, we have $81,000 in recoveries and, again, no loan losses. During the third quarter, we also received a $58,000 payment on the loan that had been previously charged off. That loan was fully recovered in 2016; the principal balance was. So since there's no principal due, the entire $58,000 was applied to interest income. So kind of a nice benefit there for the quarter. The loan growth that I mentioned, pretty diversified for the quarter. In dollars, the largest increase was in commercial, which is nice to see. We were up by $5.7 million; that's 14%. Multifamily was up $4.6 million; that's 8.1%. Real estate construction was up $3.6 million or 26.5%. That was followed by the consumer, which grew $3.8 million or 5.7%. We also experienced a slight decrease in the CRE area of $5.3 million or 2.6%. Our growth in the commercial loans, that included some new loans made during the quarter and some advances on loans made in prior quarters. On the construction side, that was all commercial construction. And in the consumer, that's our specialty auto portfolio, we did 69 of those loans during the quarter, average on those was $88,000, compared to 60 of those loans during the second quarter of this year and the average on those was $93,000. The average loan rate on the $32 million in new commitments during the quarter was 5.51%. We also renewed $11.7 million in existing loans during the third quarter. The rate on those was 5.82%. Slight decrease in the classified equity ratio at the end of September. We're down to 1.6%, and really, the classified assets remain are $957,000 in OREO. And then, we have the one commercial real estate loan. That balance is down to $136,000. Investment portfolio remains pretty much the same, primarily well-structured cash flow and mortgage products, then some high credit quality municipal bonds. Portfolio still remains relatively short. Average life – it's increased a little bit from last quarter but the average life of the entire portfolio is about 4.0 years. The effective duration of the portfolio remains quite low, about 2.8 years, and then the price change and rates up  $300 million (00:12:35) is 9.6%. On the liability side, we had pretty good quarter in the deposits. We increased balances from $581 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30. That's about a $32 million increase or about 5.5%. And much of that increase was non-interest in our money market balances. The non-interest balances increased from $214 million at the end of June to $229 million at the end of September. That's about a 6.8% increase. We continue to bring in nice new relationships. The money market, that also increased. That was $136 million at the end of June. Now, it's up to $152 million at the end of September. That's 11% increase. And then, overall, the deposits have grown $22 million or almost 4% year-to-date. Non-interest bearing balances remain high as 37% of the total deposits. An then, our non-CD balances, which refer to our core deposits, that's 86% of the total deposits. So, a little bit of a tick up in the average cost of funds. They were – a year ago, they were 39 basis points. Now, they're 64 basis points. So, that's a 25-basis point increase. And really, that's the overall rate environment. We're seeing an increase in the rates on our FHLB borrowings and in our CDs. As those will continue to roll, they're rolling over at the now current higher market rates. The overall cost of deposits for the first nine months of this year was 35 basis points. That's up from 22 basis points in the first nine months of 2018. Again, much of that increases with deposit expenses on the CD side. If you exclude the CDs, cost of our deposits in 2019 was 10 basis points. That's up from 6 basis points in 2018. Capital levels remained strong. Of course, the earnings helped increase the company's leverage ratio. We went from 8.9% at the end of December 31, 2018 to now at 9.2% at the end of September. Total risk-based capital ratio, those decreased, went from 17.3% at the end of December to 15.6% at the end of September. Obviously, that switch is from lower when we reduced the lower risk-weighted assets – the investments by moving those into the higher risk-weighted loans. That's really causing the big change there. Dave mentioned the press release, one of the press releases announced this morning. We're also going to continue to pay our cash dividend. For the quarter, it's the same, $0.07, as we did last quarter, and that would be paid next month. On our income statement, non-interest income was $417,000 in the third quarter this year. That's up from the $377,000 in the third quarter of last year. For the first nine months, non-interest income increased by $120,000. We were at $1.1 million in 2018. We're about $1.2 million in 2019, with the largest increase being service charges on deposit accounts. That went from $352,000 last year to $409,000 in the third quarter of this year. That's followed closely by gains from sale of securities. That went from $19,000 last year to $74,000 this year. On the expense side, non-interest expense increased by $90,000, from $4 million in the third quarter of last year to $4.1 million in the third quarter of this year. Primary area of the increase was in the salaries and benefits. That increased by $347,000 from third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. Again, most of that increase from a year ago is related to the salaries and benefits from the new loan production team, as well as new hires, and normal salary increases over the past 12 months. I feel the salary expense is stabilized, have been consistent the past few quarters with the exception of the third quarter this year which did see an increase, and that increase is primarily related to the higher incentive payments to the relationship managers due to the increased loan production. Offsetting this increase in salaries and benefits were lower FDIC assessments, which decreased by $109,000; lower advertising and business development, those decreased by $72,000; and telephone expense, which decreased by $47,000. The lower advertising and business development relates to a more focused spend in our target markets. We remain out in the markets to strengthen our brand and develop new relationships, but we have a year behind us now and that's allowed us to more precisely target our marketing dollars. The FDIC decrease is related to the insurance fund, reaching their target of 1.38%. We were able to use our small bank credits, which essentially gave us a credit for the assessment for second quarter, i.e., we're able to back out the previously recorded expense for the second quarter and do not have any expense in the third quarter. Assuming the fund does not drop below that 1.38%, we should be able to have enough credits to forego any expense in the fourth quarter of this year as well. That decrease in telephone expense, that relates to a move to a new phone system that we did. For the first nine months of 2019, non-interest expense increased by $1.3 million, from $11.2 million in 2018 to $12.5 million in 2019. Again, most of that increase is related to the higher salaries and benefits. We also experienced increase in expense in the other line in both periods. That increase relates to the higher business development and promotional costs we alluded during the first half of this year as we were out focusing our efforts on building our brand. On the taxes, income taxes provision for the quarter ended September 30 increased by $133,000. That's about 31%. It went from $428,000 in the third quarter last year to $561,000 in the third quarter of this year. And then on a year-to-date basis, we increased $143,000 or 11.6%, from $1.2 million in the first nine months of last year to $1.4 million in 2019. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of this year was 25.7%, compared to 24.7% during the first nine months of last year. The higher provision for taxes this year versus last year primarily resulted from a lower level of tax benefits from tax-exempt investments and equity compensation, in addition to the increase in taxable income this year. The tax benefits from the equity comp decreased from $135,000 last year to just $32,000 this year. The taxable income increased by $361,000 this year. That's about 7%, from $5 million in the first nine months of last year to $5.4 million in the first nine months of this year. That's all I have. Thank you. And I'll turn it back over to Dave for some additional comments. Thanks, Mitch. Yeah, so we've talked about the plan for the last 18 months or so, and we just continue to execute on the plan. I'm particularly excited about the consistent loan growth, coupled with the increase in deposits. As you know, we drive income from both. Particularly excited about the pre-tax, net income, ROE, ROA, EPS, they seem to be all going in the right direction. We continue to move the efficiency ratio down, which was expected. We had to hire the people, as you all know, and then, we had to generate the revenue, and that's what we're doing. The commercial banking team, in particular, has a real strong pipeline, which is equally impressive. We're getting additional business from a lot of new – some of the new clients that we brought in in the last nine months. We're getting additional looks. I think that validates our process and the service that we're providing. The retail team continues to do an outstanding job retaining clients and bringing in new deposits. They continue to do annual reviews with our top clients. We've completed over 1,000 reviews in the past nine months. And so, all in all, my comments are – I think we're doing we said we're going to do and we're trying to do it the right way in a consistent manner. And so, with that, I thought I would ask Erin to open up the line, and Mitch and I are here to answer any questions you may have. And your first question is from Tim Coffey. Tim, your line is open. Great. Thank you. Afternoon, gentlemen. Hello, Tim. Hello, Tim. Hey. So if we just kind of go back and look at the trailing four quarters of loan growth, that would put you on an annualized run rate of somewhere around the mid-teens. Is that a reasonable expectation or are you a little bit ahead of yourselves right now? Yeah. I mean, we're not trying to give projections, but the bigger the loan base growth, it's going to be tougher to grow at that mid-teens level, but we'd like to be able to shoot the double digits. Okay. And the commercial loans that you got on this quarter, how much does that change your assets sensitivity profile? Looking at the rates of those things right now, they all seem to be pretty short-term re-pricing. So technically they will, but they all have floors on them. Yeah. Great. Yeah. So it didn't impact this much. Yeah. Okay. That was my next – that was my follow-up question. Where are the floors at, or where are rates... (00:24:05) (00:24:07)? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The commercial construction you had this quarter, was any of that towards multifamily construction? No. Okay. And will there be any kind of expense cost saves? Because I know that your Chief Lending Officer has left and I don't think you plan to replace him. Is there going to be any anticipated cost saves from that? Well, as we said in the 8-K, we do not intend to replace him. So yes, but we can copy him. Dave is overseeing the Relationship Managers in the team there. So yeah, it's our – it's kind of the plan right now. Do you have an estimate on what that cost saves might be per quarter? His salary was about  $2 million (00:25:01) in the quarter... Okay. ...plus benefits and incentive there. So I don't have that exact number, but kind of... Okay. ...seeing it from there. Yeah. Yeah. We can back it from there. All right. I'll step back. Thank you. And your next question comes from Tim O'Brien with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open. Hey, Mitch, can you run down those one-time – those... Hi, Tim. Sorry, Mitch. Hi, Mitch. Hi, Dave. Good afternoon. Hi. How are you? I'm good. I'm fine. Yeah. (00:25:38). So this is a question for Mr. Derenzo. The one-time interest income items this quarter, you had a pre-pay. Can you just run down those one more time for me? I got a couple of them, but I missed one or two. Yeah. The two things we talked about that I would call unusual would be the – we had a $58,000 interest recovery. Got it. Okay. (00:26:05) interest income. Yeah. The second one was the FDIC expense, which we really had no expense for the quarter, and we had a recovery from the second quarter. I don't know if you understand how they do it, but the bill we get in September 30 is for the second quarter. So we estimate that the expense should benefit second quarter. We set up a payable. And they give us the bill, they said, there's no payment due into the second quarter, so we essentially reverse that out. So that regulatory assessment line in the press release reflects that? Correct. Yes. It's roughly $16,000 a month, so $46,000, $47,000 a quarter. And did you mention a pre-pay penalty or a number of pre-pay penalties that added to interest income also? Yeah. Yeah. Pre-payments are down. We collected just $29,000 in the third quarter. That compared to $78,000 in the third quarter last year. And on the run rate for the year, we're at $157,000 in 2019 and then $434,000 in 2018. And do you happen to have last quarter's number as well? Sorry. 2Q pre-pay? I don't. I don't. I can dig that up for you. It was small. It was small. Because we're talking $157,000 for the year, so 50/50... And no interest recovery last quarter either, right, on credit related? Yes. Okay. And then qualitatively, not quantitatively, kind of given where rates have settled and what's going on in the rate environment and what you're seeing in your marketplace from other banks, et cetera, et cetera, your sense that cost of deposits is topped out here and barring increase in rates – and market rates are something – chances are you might – that kind of topped out. Would you say directionally that's true? We're pretty comfortable with the deposit expense. Primarily, our deposits are in the non-interest bearing. We've got 37% there. So that's a big, big plus there. But the money markets has kind of settled down. We're not seeing much rate pressure there. Some of the CDs that we put on a year ago may continue to re-price as they mature. Even though there might be lower rates today than they were a month ago, they still are going to be higher than they were a year ago. So there may be a little bit of increased expense on the deposit side. But I think, overall, we're not feeling a lot of pressure from the competition. Very nominal. Okay. Great. Okay. I have a good sense of kind of where you're headed on the margin. Couple other items for you. So the $2.898 million in compensation and benefit costs this quarter, was there anything one-time in that? I know you talked about it quite a bit, but I just want to make sure I'm clear on it. Yeah. I mean, the big – as I kind of talked about, the big... Besides incentive for production. No, that's the biggie right now. Nothing bounces around based on whatever production was in the quarter, and sometimes it's hard to get a handle on that. Nothing related to FTE change? No. No. Again, we'll see a benefit of that in the fourth quarter. But nothing in the third quarter. And then, do you happen to have the FTE count core at September 30? I think it was $107,000. I think it's $106,000. $106,000? Plus or minus $100,000. Yeah. And then the other expense item line, $859,000, that was kind of low for several – many quarters. And you talked a little bit about telephone costs going to a new system and finding some savings there. So my takeaway, all things considered on the color you provided there is those cost savings, the decline in costs there, a lot of that is going to be recurring. Is that correct? Did I hear you right? Yeah, I think we spent quite a bit of money on business development activities in the first half of the year. We tend to sponsor more events in the first half of the year. Not that we're not out in the marketplace during the third and fourth quarters, but it just tends to be less intensive to spend bigger dollars on it. So third quarter should be pretty close to the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it pop back up in the first and second quarter next year. Great. Thanks for the help, guys. Welcome, Tim. Yeah. And there are no more questions at this time. All right. Thank you. Talk to you  (00:31:21) next quarter. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day, and welcome to the East West Bancorp's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julianna Balicka, Director of Strategy and Corporate Development. Please go ahead. Thank you Sean. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us to review the financial results of East West Bancorp for the third quarter of 2019. With me on this conference call today are Dominic Ng, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Irene Oh, our Chief Financial Officer. We would like to caution you that during the course of the call, management may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding events or future financial performance of the company within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may differ materially from the actual results due to a number of risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed description of the risk factors that could affect the company's operating results, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, some of the numbers referenced on this call pertains to adjusted numbers. Please refer to our third quarter earnings release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. During the course of this call, we will be referencing a slide deck that is available as part of the webcast and on the Investor Relations website. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will also be available in replay format on our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Dominic. Thank you, Julianna. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I will begin our discussion with a summary of results on slide 3. This morning, we reported third quarter 2019 net income of $171 million or $1.17 per share, both up by 14% compared to second quarter net income of $150 million and $1.03 per share. East West achieved record operating revenue of $421 million and record net interest income of $370 million in the third quarter. In this challenging interest rate environment, we are pleased with the modest quarter-over-quarter increase in net interest income of $2.5 million as well as both the reduction in our average cost of deposits, which decreased by 6 basis point quarter-over-quarter to 1.05%. I'm pleased with the results of our associated efforts to grow low cost deposits and reduce rates on higher cost exception price deposits while achieving deposit growth goals. Our expenses declined by 1% linked quarter, reflecting strong expense discipline. Quarter-over-quarter, our adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income of $263 million increased by 1%. The provision for credit losses increased to $38 million for the third quarter, an increase of $19 million from second quarter. Accordingly, our pre-tax income declined by 7.5% from the second quarter. Third quarter net interest – no, third quarter net income of $171 million increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter as we benefited from a linked quarter reduction in income tax expense. The increase in the provision expense reflects in part net charge-offs in the third quarter, which were $22 million or annualized 26 basis point of average loans held for investment. These were largely due to three non-performing loans, two of which are energy loans. Excluding the energy loans, the annualized net charge-off ratio was only 6 basis point for the third quarter. As of September 30, 2019, our non-performing asset remained low at 31 basis point of total assets. Turning to slide 4, our bottom line profitability was strong in the third quarter, with a return on assets of 1.58%; return on equity of 14.1%; and a tangible return on equity of 15.7%. Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility and in a challenging interest rate environment, East West continues to execute. As you can see from the chart on slide 4, our profitability metrics are consistently attractive. The five-quarter range of our reported tangible return on equity has been 14.5% to 18.5%, and excluding non-operating items, our operating tangible return on equity has ranged from 15.7% to 18.5% for the five – for the past five quarters. Turning to slide 5. As of September 30, 2019, total loans reached a record $34 billion and grew $291 million or 3% linked quarter annualized from June 30, 2019. Total loans grew 7% annualized year-to-date and 9% year-over-year. In the third quarter, average loans of $33.7 billion grew $680 million or 8% linked quarter annualized. In the second quarter, our average loans grew by 7% linked quarter annualized and our outlook for the remainder of the year expects average loan growth of 8% linked quarter annualized for the fourth quarter. Third quarter 2019 average loan growth was well diversified across all our major commercial and consumer loan portfolios. On an average basis, our commercial real estate loans including multifamily, construction and land loans increased $254 million or 8% annualized, followed by single-family residential mortgage and home equity line which were up $230 million or 11% annualized. In fact, this was the second best quarter in the history of East West in terms of single-family residential mortgage originations. Our average C&I loans increased $200 million or 7% annualized. Average loan yield in the third quarter declined 17 basis point linked quarter to 5.11%, reflecting two Fed funds rate cuts totaling 50 basis points and a decline in LIBOR rates. On slide 6, you can see that total deposit grew to a record $36.7 billion as of September 30, 2019, an increase of $182 million or 2% annualized from June 30. Total deposits grew 5% annualized year-to-date and 9% year-over-year. In the third quarter, average deposits of $36.5 billion grew $1.2 billion or 13% linked quarter annualized. On an average basis, noninterest-bearing demand accounts increased by $475 million or 18% annualized and interest-bearing deposit increased by $697 million or 11% annualized. Growth was well balanced between money market, noninterest demand and time deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing checking accounts. As of September 30, 2019, our end of period loan-to-deposit ratio was 92.8%, similar to the third quarter average loan-to-deposit ratio of 92.2%. As we have previously stated, we are comfortable operating with a loan-to-deposit ratio in the range of 90% to 95%. Our average total cost of deposit decreased by 6 basis point linked quarter to 1.05%, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposit decreased by 8 basis point to 1.49%. And now, I would turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our income statement and outlook. Thank you, Dominic. On page 7, we have a slide that shows the summary income statement and a snapshot of notable items during the quarter. Our tax expense this quarter was $35 million and our effective tax rate was 17%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 16% in the third quarter of last year. Last quarter, recall we incurred $30 million of additional income tax expense for the reversal of certain previously claimed tax credits. Moving on to the discussion of net interest income on page 8. Third quarter net interest income of $370 million increased by 1% linked quarter and grew by 6% year-over-year. Third quarter net interest income growth reflects growth in interest income from average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. Average deposit growth outpaced loan growth in the third quarter and excess liquidity, increased cash and cash equivalents. In addition, interest expense also declined, reflecting a reduction in the average cost of funds, which decreased by 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Combined, these drivers offset the pressure from declining yields on assets. The third quarter GAAP net interest margin was 3.59% and the adjusted NIM, excluding the impact of ASC 310-30 discount accretion was 3.56%. The 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter change in our GAAP net interest margin breaks down as follows, a 14-basis-point decrease from lower loan yields including fees and discounts; a 2 basis points decrease from lower yield on other earning assets; a 4-basis-point decrease from the asset mix shift, namely the increase in interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks; a 1-basis-point decrease from a funding mix shift; an increase of FHLB advances; all of which were partially offset by a 7-basis-point increase in the net interest margin from a lower cost of funds. Our loan portfolio is largely variable rate and the most impactful interest rate indices for our loans are primary and the one month LIBOR. The decline in interest rates this quarter was reflected in our monthly weighted average loan yield, which was 5.08% for the month of September compared to 5.27% for the month of June. In addition, we have been managing our securities portfolio to maintain an essentially stable yield by replacing maturing cash flow with slightly higher yield at approximately 90 basis points above the six-month Treasury rate and slightly longer durations. Despite the decline in the Fed funds' target rate, deposit pricing competition from other banks remained acute. Nevertheless, as Dominic mentioned in his remarks, we have had success in reducing our deposit costs this quarter. As of September 30, 2019, the end of period cost of our deposits was 1.01%, down by 10 basis points from 1.11% as of June 30. The end of period cost of our interest-bearing deposits was 1.43% as of September 30, down by 14 basis points from 1.57% as of June 30. Importantly, we are lowering deposit costs, while simultaneously continuing to grow core deposits. Now, turning to slide 9. Total noninterest income in the third quarter was $51.5 million, a 2% decrease linked quarter. Fee income and net gains on sales of loans totaled $51 million, a 4% increase from $49 million in the second quarter of 2019. Net gains on sales of loans increased by $2 million, reflecting the volume of our SBA 7(a) loans sold during the quarter. Wealth management fees increased by $1 million, reflecting ongoing gains and increases in customer volumes. Customer-driven interest rate contract revenue was $11.1 million in the third quarter 2019 compared to $11.8 million in the second quarter. This is a slight quarter-to-quarter decrease in customer-driven revenue, but still significantly above historic run rate, reflecting strong customer demand in the current interest rate environment for this product. Offsetting the revenue is the CVA adjustment which was a negative $2.7 million in the third quarter compared to a negative $1.4 million in the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter change in the CVA reflects a decline in the long-term interest rates during the third quarter. Moving on to slide 10. Third quarter noninterest expense was $177 million, a decrease of 1%. Excluding amortization of tax credit investments and core deposit intangibles, our adjusted noninterest expense was $159 million in the third quarter 2019, a decrease of 1% quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to a decrease in compensation and employee benefits. Our efficiency ratio improved modestly quarter-over-quarter. Our third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 37.7%, compared to 38% in the second quarter. Over the past five quarters, our adjusted efficiency ratio has ranged from 37.7% to 39.9%. Our third quarter 2019 pre-tax, pre-provision income of $263 million increased 1% quarter-over-quarter, and our third quarter pre-tax, pre-provision profitability ratio was 2.42% compared to 2.51% from the second quarter. Over the past five quarters, our pre-tax, pre-provision profitability ratio has ranged from 2.42% to 2.51%. In slide 11 on the presentation, we detail out critical asset quality metrics. Our allowance for loan losses totaled $346 million as of September 30, 2019 or 1.02% of loans held for investment compared to 98 basis points as of June 30, 2019 and 96 basis points as of December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2019 were $135 million or low 31 basis points of total assets compared to 28 basis points of total assets as of June 30 and 23 basis points of total assets at December 31, 2018. For the third quarter of 2019, our net charge-offs were $22 million or an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and we recorded a provision for credit losses of $38 million. This is an increase in net charge-offs of $15 million and an increase in the provision for credit losses of $19 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to capital ratios on slide 12. East West capital ratios are strong. Tangible equity per share of $30.22 as of September 30 grew 4% linked quarter and grew by 11% year-to-date. The tangible equity to tangible assets ratio has increased by 57 basis points year-to-date and our regulatory capital ratios increased by 41 to 56 basis points year-to-date. East West Board of Directors has declared fourth quarter 2019 dividends for the company's common stock. The common stock cash dividend of $0.275 is payable on November 15, 2019 to stockholders of record on November 1, 2019. And with that, I'll move on to updating our 2019 outlook on slide 13. Our outlook covers results for the full year 2019 compared to our full year 2018 results. We experienced a higher level of payoffs and paydowns in the third quarter. Based on the year-to-date results, we are lowering our full year end of period loan growth outlook to 7% from 10%. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting 7% linked quarter annualized growth based on current pipeline and expectations for the remainder of the year. Quarter-to-date, fourth quarter has started off strong in terms of loan growth. In our assumptions for the rest of the year, we expect the Fed to cut rates 25 basis points in October. For the full year, we expect our net interest margin, excluding the  amount (17:53) of discount accretion to range between 3.60% and 3.65%. Our full year outlook implies that we expect the net interest margin for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 3.40% to 3.45%. Our success in controlling deposit costs has been helping to offset the headwinds to our NIM from our variable rate loan book and the continued flattening of the yield curve. With these revisions, we expect net interest income to grow approximately 6% year-over-year. We are also narrowing our expense growth expectations and expect our noninterest expense, excluding tax credit, investment and core deposit intangible amortization, to grow approximately 3% year-over-year or essentially flat expenses quarter-over-quarter for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect the provision for credit losses to be approximately $100 million. And finally, for the full year 2019 we project that our effective tax credit – tax rate, excuse me, will be approximately 20% including the impact of a $30 million tax credit reversal from the second quarter. The full year tax rate assumes tax credit investments of $97 million in 2019, and for the fourth quarter, we currently expect that the tax credit amortization will be approximately $45 million. With that, I will now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks. Thank you, Irene. I would now open up the call to questions. Operator? Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Ebrahim. Just first question on credit appreciating that like absolute level of charge-offs and NPAs are low, but there's now obviously been a fair amount of concern around trends in your classified assets year-to-date. So I was just wondering if, Irene, you can provide us where classified assets were, special mention, substandard loans, at the end of September. And if we can particularly talk about just what we are seeing in the C&I book on credit and on the energy front. Do you expect additional hiccups as we move through year end into next year? So, Ebrahim, as of the end of the third quarter total classified loans were $442 million, special mention loans were $526 million. Got it. So, special mention... So special mention dipped down slightly from where we were at $630 million to $526 million. Understood. And it was my understanding that you guys were just sort of doing a deeper sort of review of the C&I book. I was wondering if there were any takeaways from that, and just, again, your thoughts on the energy book as we think about future credit issues. Yeah. We've mentioned on the call that we continue to actively review our portfolio, all the portfolio quite frankly, not just C&I and the energy book. So with that, we feel comfortable as far as the grading, the allowance, and where we stand today. Our next question will come from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Wondering if you could speak to the updated expense guidance, it seems, it's in response to the top line pressures from the environment on rates. But as you're thinking kind of broadly, how should we be thinking about positive operating leverage in this environment? Thanks. Morning, Chris. Yeah, I don't know if it's really kind of in response to the top line revenue, but certainly, we're practical and we look at kind of where the revenue growth is coming from and what we need to do. I think the way I'd characterize it, it's really more of a narrowing of the guidance  Ebrahim (22:31) and we only have one quarter to go, quite frankly. Okay. And maybe on the loan growth, I think you mentioned paydowns and payoffs kind of affecting this quarter. Could you maybe elaborate on that and maybe whether any of the trade negotiations have had an impact on borrower demand? Thanks. In terms of the third quarter payoff and paydown actually, we looked at it specifically, it came from a few different sectors, commercial real estate. In fact it's – we actually have pretty nice growth, but it's just at right around the – near the end of the third quarter. Northern California region have a few large loans that got paydown in the third quarter, right around the quarter end. But I would expect that in the fourth quarter commercial real estate would pick up pretty strongly, make up the difference. And the other sectors that have seen the higher than expected paydown, one, is entertainment sector. There were a few large loans that just happened that the customer have extra liquidity and wanted to pay off the loans in the third quarter. And in addition to that, our private equity and also venture capital sector business have actually some high increase in drawdown and then resulted in a substantial decrease in the balances with paydown right around September. So, these are the normal activity that is taking place in these different sectors. There is a little bit more of the volatility of the C&I loans. Our next question will come from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate the NIM guide and the look into Q4 to kind of square the circle on the full year. Assuming, say, two cuts next year, should we kind of assume the same glide path in NIM next year? Yeah. Brock, we give guidance for the next year with that earnings call that we all have in January, so I'm going to refrain from kind of making any comments for 2020, but certainly with the actual results this quarter and then also our expectation for fourth quarter, you can kind of make your own assumptions around that. Okay. And in terms of the credit discussion, the pickup in NPLs this quarter, was that – can you give us any kind of look at the industry concentration of the NPL pickup? Well, we suddenly have these energy loans, and then I think in the mixture of a few different categories. I think we always had maybe a few CRE that's been there for a long time, from back to even the old days. And as – but we know that the collateral value is there but it's just has been stay in the NPA for a long time is because it hasn't been resolved. And then the rest of them are just coming from different sectors. Our next question will come from Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Hi, Good morning. Just wanted to get some more color, it looks like on your securities portfolio, it looks like you're starting to grow that a little quicker here. Should we expect the balance sheet to grow faster than loans from here and into next year to help kind of mitigate the NIM pressure and maintain kind of NII year-over-year? Yeah. I think if you look at the third quarter results that we did grow, which is very positive, deposit growth was faster than the loan growth. And so that excess liquidity was placed in our securities book, which is our AFS portfolio, and then also the other resale agreements and deposits that we have. That really isn't our strategy. Certainly, if we have excess liquidity and we can make some spreads and increase the NII, we'll certainly do so, but as you also know that also hurts the NIM. But we were preparing kind of – we're – with the deposits that come from our customers in normal course of business, certainly if there's extra liquidity we'll redeploy that probably in the securities book if the loan growth isn't there. But with that said, we're also actively managing the deposits and using this opportunity that when deposit growth happens, core deposit growth, to lay off some of the higher cost deposits. So that'll be a active strategy that will continue in the fourth quarter as well and next year. Okay. And then the CD is maturing in the fourth quarter, can you give us the rate at which they're maturing and renewal rates? Yeah. Give me one minute. I have a thousand sheets here and that is certainly one of them that we have. If you look at the deposits that we have maturing in the fourth quarter, we have approximately $2.7 billion CDs with a weighted average interest rate of 1.96%. And first quarter next year, roughly the same amount as well, same rate, slightly higher at 2.8%. Our next question will come from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. I appreciate the color on the loan paydown actually this quarter. Can you give a little update on how the overall loan pipeline is looking as we go into fourth quarter? And should we expect to see that C&I starts to outpace the CRE again in fourth quarter? The loan pipeline so far looks pretty good. And I don't know whether C&I will outpace CRE, they both have pretty decent pipeline. But traditionally, we always have a little bit stronger fourth quarter than the other quarters. So we would expect that there are high likelihood that the fourth quarter will have stronger origination results than the other quarters we had during the year. Okay. Thanks. And then, it was nice to see in August the large amount of insider purchases of the stock and taking advantage of the price here. With the capital growing and a relatively low dividend payout ratio, I guess, why wouldn't you consider a buyback for the – at the corporate level as well? It seems like that would be a good return and good use of capital from here. One, I think, one, we'd feel like putting our own cash up is a – actually, is a much stronger indication of our confidence with the bank than using corporate cash. The other thing is actually I actually highlighted before, that is that you look at where we are today, even in this quarter, our return of equity and our return of assets are still performing at the top quartile of banks in US. So, we are generate pretty good return even with these excess capital so to speak. That's the second reason. The third reason is that so I'm looking at the overall fundamental in US and our financial performance so far so good. However, there are dark clouds sort of in the future. We're looking at, for example, the Trump administration have just gotten WTO approval of imposing 100% tariff against certain imports coming from Europe. We still have not signed the North America free trade treaty with Canada and Mexico, and we're supposed to on December 15 to impose tariff on $550 billion of import coming from China. Now, what is the likelihood all of these things is going to be happening to hurt the economy? Probably not. But if you look at what the Fed had done, obviously, they're not cutting interest rate twice to appease our administration. They are doing it because they also worry about the future despite the fact that the fundamentals are strong today. So from that standpoint, I looked at it as that, while I don't expect that all these bad news will be happening, that things are going to be really bad. But just in case, I rather have more capital than all the other banks. But if that doesn't happen, economies are very strong, things are going really well, stock market coming back strong, because of all these other stuff that we worry about, how – come 2020, in the presidential election, and things actually got better, then I need the capital to grow anyway because we tend to grow a little bit faster than the other banks. So it's all the sort of like last three reason combining together, we conclude that at this stage we're just going to stay put. Our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Actually, just specifically in terms of loan growth this quarter, I think you've mentioned one of the reasons for the 3Q weakness was higher payoffs in private equity and venture capital. Are you – again, towards the end of September, are you seeing any of that come back in October or is that expected to remain low in the fourth quarter? Yeah. In fact these are just private equity funds, their activity – it's really hard to predict when they need to draw down, when they need to pay down, because often time it depends on the investment that they make. And so the PE funds has always been harder to predict, but we continue to bring in more PE clients throughout the years. So from that standpoint I think that we feel pretty good that all in all, if you look at average growth, that we are doing pretty good. It's just that it's hard to predict that one particular moment. And then I think the late September is one of those unusual moments. The fact is, if you look at our average loan growth for the third quarter, has been pretty good, I mean, an average of 8% and then it's pretty across the board in all different loan categories. So it's just that come September 30, we have to just pay down. Got it. Okay. And then in terms of expenses, sorry, it's a multipart question. A, I think I heard you say $45 million tax credit amortization, I just wanted to clarify that. But also B, the 3% ex-amortization guidance seems to imply a noticeable drop in fourth quarter expenses, so I'll make sure we're thinking about that right. And kind of what drives that drop in expenses? Thanks. Yeah. So, on the amortization, you are correct. Our current estimate is that the $45 million for fourth quarter. For expenses in total, it doesn't really imply a drop per se from the third quarter levels, but certainly I think, as I mentioned earlier, we're narrowing it given that we have one quarter in. Our next question will come from Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. Following up on the expense question, just curious, obviously with this challenging rate environment, you guys are being pretty mindful about expenses. As you look out to next year, is there – are there any technology investments or other initiatives that would keep you from being able to keep a lid on expenses going forward? I think that what we've seen so far is that when you say that technology that can help to reduce expense, is that the question? No. I'm wondering if there's any technology investments or other initiatives, core systems conversions, that sort of thing, that would cause a bigger spend in that arena than we might expect. Oh, I see. Well, actually, one is that we actually – we're fortunate for the last few years, we have continuously investing in our core technology and we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of a back office infrastructure, and then some of the system upgrades from cash management area and then a few other areas. And then our BSA system is one of those – I was saying that one of the best in the country. So, however, we will continue to invest. For example, a couple of initiative which is important for us that we would invest in 2020, one, being the foreign exchange system. I think we have an upgrade we can do that can help to make our foreign exchange capability even stronger, so that we can bring in even more sophisticated clients or provide even better service for our clients that require foreign exchange services. The second one is our Hong Kong online banking. This is another one that we feel that it will substantially improve our capability to serve our overseas customers. So, these are the two that I think that we will definitely invest and then we'll continue to invest in our digital banking initiatives that we have started about a year-and-a-half ago. So, those are the three, but I mean it's nothing unusual. Okay. And then as my follow-up, going back to the credit, there were three commercial loans highlighted, I think you said two of them were energy. In what industry is the third? And then also maybe just with respect to the energy, any additional details you can give in terms of the types of energy loans, whether it's field services or exploration or kind of what categories those fall into? Yeah. So, the two energy loans where we had the increased kind of charge-offs related to that were in E&P. So, the reserve-based lending loans. The other one was in our life sciences kind of category. Our next question will come from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, there. Just a follow-up on credit again and if your loan loss provision guidance of $100 million implies the provision is expected to come down in the fourth quarter. I mean, given the trends that we're seeing on criticized assets, how confident are you with that lower provisioning and I guess charge-off outlook? Yeah. I think that's a great question, Lana. I mean, I think with the – so with – we're – we've continued as I mentioned earlier to scrub our portfolios, I'm comfortable at this point in time that the grades are correct and the allowance is appropriate. Our forecast for fourth quarter factors in some analysis that we've done on what could happen with the migration in the portfolio. So we're comfortable with that at this point in time. Okay. And just a follow-up, how big is your energy portfolio right now and how much of it is on special mention or classified? Yeah. Our total energy portfolio is $1.2 billion outstanding. The percentage of it that is on watch, classified is at 3%. The  (40:19) is 5%. Our next question is a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Good morning, again. I just had a follow-up on credit and I think there's been a fair amount of questions and concern around your stock on credit. Just taking a step back, Dominic, we'd love to get your thoughts around, are you seeing noticeable signs of credit weakness within the portfolio as you look forward where things stand today? Or do you think this is just quarterly noise given how low credit metrics are and things should remain near current levels absent a bigger deterioration in the economy? Well, I think that with the general economy, I wouldn't say a much of a slowdown, it's just more that business sentiments are getting more cautious. So, there are maybe a little bit lack of interest of making substantial capital investments and that do cause a slowdown in the economy to a certain degree. And a lack – of a little bit lack of let's say consumer confidence that also would affect consumer purchase that affect business overall. We, from our portfolio standpoint, really have not seen much weaknesses. I mean, actually interesting enough is that everybody have concern of the perception of how tariffs will affect East West Bank. And when I look at these charge-offs so far, that we really have not had anything so far this year  got have much have (42:05) anything to do with these tariffs. In fact, we have watched this portfolio very carefully. Frankly, for the last couple of years we have exited over $250 million of C&I loans that we felt that potentially tariff will affect this business and we send those clients to other banks. So from that standpoint, I think so far so good. We actually have – clearly have the capabilities to manage the challenge in terms of this trade war and somehow navigated so far so good. If I looked at our portfolio where that we do find a deterioration is in the energy and in fact it is something that actually well known in that specific industry that all banks that have energy exposure are taking a little bit of loss here and there, and so are we. And it's just that the equity market in the energy sector had dried up quite a bit and for the last several months, and to that extent have caused some substantial distress to some of these E&P business. So in that standpoint and that's why we – as much as – what we are doing right now is that, as Irene mentioned we have this $1.2 billion of energy loans, is a total of 98 relationship. So it's very easy for us to get to 98 loans and so far we have two that actually resulted in charge-off, and as Irene mentioned earlier, we have two more classified. And we are – our energy team and also our credit administration team have reviewed the entire portfolio and appropriately risk rated these loans and classify them in appropriate buckets and we will continue to monitor these loans to make sure that we stay vigilant to ensure that we do not have a sort of like keep our eyes off the ball with these energy loans. But other than that, I think as of today, we have not seen anything particular that will cause us to have substantial concern. That is extremely helpful. And just in term of the energy book, how much of the book is reserve-based, what is services, what is midstream loans? Yeah. We – most of the portfolio is E&P or midstream, about 70% is E&P and 30% is midstream. We have very little in the services. I don't have the exact numbers, Ebrahim, but that was really a legacy from the Metro, some loans from that, but it's very small. Our next question will come from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So first on resi mortgage. So originations were strong, but growth slowed owing to paydowns. So I was curious, do you expect a rebound in resi mortgage growth back to, say, the 20s percent annualized looking forward or is mid-teens growth kind of a new normal? Well, one of the reasons why we have higher paydown, I would say that we tend to have a higher paydown maybe than – I don't know, I mean, I don't know about what normal from other shops in fact, I haven't looked at that. But the reason we have a higher paydown is because East West in the past have traditionally not in favor of making fixed rate, long-term mortgage of 15-year fix, of 30 years fix. We have always been very active in three years, five years, seven years. And the reason we did that is really for our own internal asset liability management. And frankly, six, seven years ago, when interest rate were at – I mean, Fed fund rate at 25 basis points, we knew one day the rate will start rising. So we intentionally not wanted to have too much exposure in long-term fixed rate. And so in fact, about three, two years ago we also noticed that since rate had risen enough, we feel pretty safe so we started implementing 15, 30 years fixed rate mortgage. Now, when we have customers are so used to with the shorter term and even if we'll offer the longer term fixed rate, it took a little while for the – for us internally to sort of like promoted and it took a little while for customers to adapt to it. But what we found is that for the last two or three quarters, we are getting more and more stronger response from our customers in taking on these long term fixed rate mortgages. Now with that, I think in time, when there are more customers having longer term fixed rate mortgages, the likelihood of them having to refi, because the loan mature, is less. So I think this will be a gradual process and I would think that in the next quarter, we'll probably still see some high payoff just like what we have. But then I feel pretty confident the pipeline in the single-family mortgage loan origination there will be strong and we will continue to get us into a pretty decent sort of like a growth in terms of – in the fourth quarter. But probably not going to be in that 20 percentile we'll see. Thanks for that and my follow-up is on energy. You mentioned about 98 relationships and I'm not sure if it's the right way to think about it. But are you able to  save – (48:39) what price of oil where your energy loans underwritten at and at what price does oil need to be for the energy book to stabilize from a credit perspective? We don't have that information in front of us right now but we can share with you at later on if you need to. After the call we can follow up on that. We – I apologize. We don't have it in front of us. Our next question will come from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, sorry, I was just cut off before. I just had another question on energy. What are your reserves against the energy book right now? As of 9/30 on the portfolio we have about $30 million. Okay. It's about a little over 2%. Great. Thanks, Irene. This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dominic for any closing remarks. Well, thank you all for joining the call and I am looking forward to talking to all of you in January 2020. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Edward Wehmer. Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. With me as always are Dave Dykstra, our Chief Operating Officer; Kate Boege, our – what are you, Kate? You're our General Counsel; and David Stoehr, CFO. What we'll do – we'll have the same format as usual. I'll give some general comments regarding our results, turn it over to Dave for a more detailed analysis of other income, other expenses and taxes, back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future, and then have some time for questions. Onto the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date, in general the quarter can be summarized as follows: record quarterly earnings, nice to be able to say that again; very strong organic balance sheet growth; margin and net interest income pressures due to rate environment effectively offset by strong mortgage results and balance sheet growth; credit metrics returned to historically low numbers; one-timers being the MSR valuation adjustment and FDIC refund were $4 million each and basically offset each other; and we had about $1.3 million pre-tax and acquisition related expenses. Net income was $99.1 million for the quarter, up to $200 – close to $270 million for the year, that's up 2%. Same could be said for the earnings per share on the year-to-date basis $4.60 compared to $4.50 and $1.69 compared to $1.38 for the quarter, we're up 22% from last quarter, but that last quarter included some extra charges on the credit side. Look at net income pre-MSR valuation adjustments, the quarter we're up 21% and the year we're up 9%, same for earnings per share. So close to double-digit earnings growth that we project and that we always look for, return on assets was up by 1.16%, return on equity 11.42%, return on tangible equity 14.36%. And our net overhead ratio dropped to 1.40% due to a balance sheet growth and fee income on the mortgage side, about 24 basis point drop, basically offset the drop in the net interest margin. All-in-all, a pretty good quarter considering the rate environment and the headwinds that we had, the NIM, as been frequently pointed out to-date fell 25 basis points, as earning asset yields fell 21 basis points, interest expense rose 2 basis points and then net free funds ratio was positive with a margin of 1 basis point. Loan yields fell 14 basis points, loans held-for-sale fell 79 basis points while liquidity management yields fell 30 basis points. The drop in liquidity management yields was due to the $812 million increase in average liquidity management assets during the quarter. This increase at the time – at the end of the quarter had yet to be invested into longer term securities as evidenced by the drop in liquidity management portfolio duration from 4.1 years to 3.4 years. Investing these assets into longer term securities will assist this part of the margin contribution going forward. Well underway doing that as we speak. Our goal is to maintain our approximate six-year duration in liquidity management assets, so we have some opportunity there. This also resulted in our loan-to-deposit ratio falling into our desired 85% to 90% range but just barely at 89.6% down from 92% in the prior quarter. On the interest expense front, deposits expense increased 6 basis points in the quarter, but flat from our monthly June run rate. As you know it takes time to decrease deposit rates. We're actively and aggressively working to do this and decrease the cost of funds on our deposit base. So there's a lot of opportunity here also. Consumers don't know what LIBOR is. LIBOR can fall but until you get moves in prime it's hard to move your deposit rates in this competitive environment. But we feel pretty good about where we are. Our overall cost of funds in interest-bearing liabilities was up 5 basis points, deposit increased plus the full quarter of our $300 million in sub-debt which was 2 basis points was offset by lower funding and other funding cost decreases. On the net interest income front, quarter decrease was only $1.3 million. I was telling somebody that I can't eat net interest margin, I can eat net interest income and by $1.3 million, we believe that that's easily made up through the investments that we made in the liquidity management and as we lower the cost of – lower our cost of funds, we feel very good about it and continue to grow by the way. We feel very good about where we are right now. Going forward depending on the rate environment, further rate cuts will not be appreciated by the way. We expect the margin to be under decreased pressure due to our ability to deploy liquidity management assets, the higher yielding securities, aggressive deposit cost cutting where we can. We're closing the STC deal and the Countryside Bank deals which led approximately $800 million of total assets and additional organic loan growth, more on this later. Net interest income should grow as a result of the above and additional organic franchise growth. The other income and other expense side, Dave will be reviewing these areas in detail a bit later, I'd like to provide some high level remarks. Obviously, the quarter is greatly influenced by mortgage banking results. If you know our business model, you know that we have a very diversified model with internal hedges in the businesses that we have. When rates fall, our mortgages take off and cover while we get the margin squared away and go from there and it's working in that regard. I know a lot of people think that mortgages – the mortgage business is too volatile to be considered core, but this is an integral part of what we do in a part of our overall management and it's working as we anticipated. We expect strong growth and strong results in the fourth quarter and hopefully in the first quarter rates will remain where they are. We're being very aggressive on the mortgage side. Our new product, a person can apply for a mortgage in basically a little over an hour online and have it in and we're able to turn around relatively quickly. So we're advertising and we believe that this is – it's a good thing for us and it's working just as we anticipated. Other expenses were in line and consistent with prior quarter when one considers the increased commissions and the increased mortgage business. Other than that I think we're in pretty good shape. The net overhead ratio fell to 1.40%, the  25 basis point increase (00:08:23) basically offset as I said earlier the drop in the margin; this coupled with a return to historical norms and credit costs resulted in the record quarter we experienced. One-timers included offsetting MSR valuation adjustments and FDI insurance refunds, as well as the $1.3 million acquisition-related expenses. One would add back the after tax of those net of those one-timers, we would have experienced our first quarter where we exceeded $100 million. We look forward to achieving that milestone very, very soon. If one were to omit the negative MSR valuation adjustments for the year, as I said earlier we'll be close to achieving our double-digit earnings growth objective, despite the second quarter credit blip that we had. On the balance sheet side, we continued our strong balance sheet growth in the quarter. The assets were up $1.2 billion to almost $35 billion; average earning assets were $31 million from $29 million of $1.7 billion. Loans were up $405 million with $364 million head start in the fourth – for the fourth quarter due to the average and ending issues that we always – we're always seeing  to book things (00:09:40) at the end of the quarter, but we start with a great – a good head start going forward. Deposits were up almost $1.2 billion, that's after returning over $500 million in expensive brokered funds that occurred during the quarter that will help us also in the overall cost of funds. So on average our deposits are up $1.8 billion. Loan-to-deposit ratio at 89.6% as I said and I talked about the liquidity management yield, and the investment of those that were down 30 basis points, but we expect to pick some of that up through the investments we're making and have made already this quarter. On the loan side, loan growth was good across the board. Pipelines, real estate loans and commercial residential grew $257 million. Insurance premium finance grew $240 million. And basically with C&I, our commercial portfolio is relatively flat, down a little bit. We still have good pipelines. We're booking a lot of deals, but we're seeing companies sell. We only lost maybe $89 million, $90 million going out to other institutions last quarter. That's consistent with every quarter we've had, in the past three or four quarters, most of them go to FinCo companies, where we retained the deposit relationship, but we're seeing a lot of recaps and dividend recaps, people taking money out in more highly leveraged transactions that we don't – don't fit into our credit appetite. So all the numbers if you look at the paydowns and what we've had, the numbers are consistent over the last four quarters. Primarily we start the fourth quarter close to $350 million, our head start on the loan front as growth again this quarter was backend loaded. Our pipelines remain consistently strong. We expect to continue growing loans in the single-digit area – single-digit percentage-wise, consistent with our prior statements in that regard. On credit side, as mentioned, credit metrics returned to historical norms. NPLs decreased in total 0.38% of outstandings; it's as low as it's been at any time in the recent past. Same could be said for non-performing assets, which stood at 44 basis points of total assets. Again, it was as low as they've been in recent past. Net charge-offs of $9 million included $4 million in charges that was related to the three credits we discussed last quarter. They had been reserved for. So in that previous quarter and provided for so, they're behind us now. I declare the issue closed on these particular bad assets and good riddance to them all. Charge-offs for the quarter and the year were 15 basis points of average total loans. We expect that to be a number going forward that we're comfortable with. We continue to call the portfolio looking for problem credits before they become problems and get them on an expeditious basis as there are a still number of  mighties (00:12:51) out there who will eat anything. So we – when we ask somebody to leave, they can find a new home relatively quickly. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dave to talk about other income and other expense and taxes. All right. Thank you, Ed. As normal, I'll briefly touch on the non-interest income and expense sections that had significant variations and just in general. So turning first to the non-interest income, our wealth management revenue stayed relatively steady at $24 million from the third quarter compared to $24.1 million in the second quarter this year and was up 6% from the $22.6 million recorded in the year ago quarter. Overall, we believe the third quarter of this year was another solid period for us in our wealth management segment. Mortgage banking revenue increased by 36% or $13.5 million to $50.9 million from the third quarter, from $37.4 million recorded in the prior quarter and was also up 21% from the $42 million recorded in the third quarter of last year. The increase in this category as revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from higher levels of loans originated and sold during the quarter, a mix of originations weighted more heavily to the higher margin business versus the prior quarter aided the higher average production margins. We basically have worn down the corresponded channel of our mortgage business during the quarter. The company originated approximately $1.42 billion of mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter. This compares to $1.15 billion originations in each of the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of last year. The mix of loan volume originated for sale that was related to purchase home activity was approximately 48%, compared to 63% in the prior quarter. So refinance volumes increased substantially during the quarter and was relatively equal weighted with the purchased home activity. We continue to see an elevated level of refinance volume going into the fourth quarter relative to the prior quarters. Table 16 of our third quarter earnings release provides a detailed compilation of the components of origination volumes by delivery channel and also the mortgage banking revenue including production revenue, MSR capitalization, MSR fair value and other adjustments and servicing income. Given the pipelines we have and the increase in refinance business, we expect the fourth quarter to again be another strong quarter for the mortgage operation. Other non-interest income totaled $17.6 million in the third quarter of 2019, up approximately $3.4 million from the $14.1 million recorded in the second quarter of this year. The primary reasons for that increased revenue in this category include $1.6 million of higher interest rate swap fee revenue and $1.7 million of income from investments and partnerships. Turning to non-interest expense categories, our non-interest expenses totaled $234.6 million in the third quarter, up approximately $4.9 million or 2.2% from the prior quarter. Commissions associated with a significant increase in the mortgage production and acquisition-related charges of approximately $1.3 million were the primary drivers of the increase. Turning to the more significant categories, the salaries and employee benefits expense category increased approximately $7.3 million in the third quarter from the second quarter of this year. Commissions and incentive compensation expense accounted for approximately $3.8 million of that increase relative to the prior quarter and that was due to the higher commission expense tied to the  accretionally (00:16:50) greater mortgage origination production. Salaries expense accounted for slightly more than $2.7 million of the increase resulting from a full quarter of the staffing costs related to the Oak Bank acquisition completed in late May of 2019, approximately $1.1 million of severance accruals partially related to the  recent acquisitions (00:17:09) and normal growth as the company continues to expand including staffing for the seven new branch banking locations that we opened this year. Additionally employee benefits expense was approximately $782,000 higher in the current quarter than the prior quarter due primarily to the impact of higher health insurance claims during the quarter. Turning to equipment expense, it totaled $13.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $555,000 as compared to the second quarter of 2019. The increase in the current quarter relates primarily to increased software depreciation and licensing. Professional fees increased to $8 million in the third quarter, compared to $6.2 million in the prior quarter. These fees can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the level of legal services related acquisitions, litigation, prime loan workouts, as well as any consulting services. Although up slightly from the prior quarter this category of expenses remains close to the mid-range of the last five quarters expense totals. The slight increase in this category's expense was due primarily to acquisition related legal fees, an increase in consulting fees, which related primarily to some works that we're having done relative to the CSIL projects and the LIBOR replacement projects, and then also a small increase in legal fees for loan documentation and collections. The FDIC insurance expense was down $4 million in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. As you may know, the FDIC insurance assessment regulations provided that after the reserve ratio reached 1.38% the FDIC would apply small bank credits to reduce small banks regular deposit insurance assessments up to the full amount of the assessments or the full amount of the credit whichever is less. The reserve ratio reached 1.40% all on June 30th of 2019, therefore credits were first applied on our September 2019 invoice. Since each of our subsidiary banks are less than $10 billion in assets, each of them qualified for the credits. We believe we have up to $3 million of additional assessment credits that could be applied in the future if the insurance reserve ratio remains above the required threshold. Other than the expense categories that I just discussed, all of the other expense categories were down in the aggregate by a little over $700,000 from the prior quarter, with no particular items to know. As Ed mentioned, the company's net overhead ratio for the third quarter improved to 1.40% from 1.64% in the prior quarter and improved to 1.58% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This 24 basis point decline in net overhead ratio essentially offset the net interest margin compression for the quarter and was primarily driven by growth in total assets and strong mortgage origination quarter. We expect balance sheet growth and a continuing strong mortgage market will result in the company having another good net overhead ratio in the fourth quarter and should cause our annual net overhead ratio to be less than our previously discussed target of 1.55% for the year. So with that, I will conclude my comments and turn it back over to Ed. Thanks, Dave. It's nice to be back in the record earnings – on the record quarterly earnings trend, that's 12 out of the last 15 quarters that we've had record earnings and we expect it's our goal to continue that trend going forward – pardon me. Although, the rate environment provides a plethora of challenges we believe that we will be able to navigate through the storm. Overall growth and – overall growth both organic and acquisition, we've talked in previous quarters about the ability to add organic growth without a commensurate increase in expenses. If in fact, we grow faster than loans again, that's okay. I think we can make a net 1% after tax or higher on the investments that we make as we ladder out a portfolio. We want to make sure the numbers are – that the deposits are sticky enough, they stay here so we don't get upside down on anything like that. But we feel – we feel that that plus adding $800 million in assets from the two acquisitions will be important. To increase our cost of funds is a priority. Again we are actively doing that as we speak with the last drop in prime where customers understand. The rate environment is going down and we're able to execute these, loan pipeline still remain very strong, we're deploying liquidity management assets. We have every expectation of a continued strong mortgage market. Credit though always the big question it looks pretty good right now, but you never know we're not ones that kick the can down the road as you all know when it comes to credit. We're going to continue good growth and will be the key. We also have closed this STC transaction, already expect to close Countryside this quarter, that's $800 million in total assets as I said earlier. We expect significant cost outs from these deals. But it will take a few quarters to achieve these efficiencies. We have to get them converted and it takes a couple of quarters to do that. But STC is close to 80% cost out for us and by estimate and the Countryside deal is closer to 35% to 40% cost out. So those should be very accretive to us when we get that done. We're not a loss for future acquisition opportunities as our pipelines remain full. We're consistently concerning in the value of these opportunities in all areas of our business. As always we can be assured of our best efforts. We appreciate your support and look forward to future record quarters going forward. Now it's time for questions. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Hi, Jon. How are you? Hi. I am good, how about you? Living a dream every day. Good. I love it when we put out record earnings and the stack gets clobbered, but maybe we should go the other way uh? Oh this is the opportunity, Ed. I want to ask about this margin and mortgage. But on deposits what was different, what drove that quarter. That was a big deposit growth number. And you kind of alluded to it. But if that continues and you have the acquired deposits come on, it kind of feels like next quarter looks a lot like this quarter with some NIM pressure, but maybe some growth in net interest income. But just maybe touch on what drove it and what you guys are thinking for how this might look in Q4. Well, if you look at the last few quarters, let me pull it up here, deposits have grown in December $2.6 billion. In March, $1.9 billion. This month $1.2 billion, at one point it should be closer to $1.7 billion, if you add the broker we paid back. Yep. So this is consistent, this is just consistent growth for us. Our marketing is paying off. The – we opened new branches, the acquisitions, we started marketing heavily into those markets. These smaller banks are – never really had the capital to go out and market. So a lot of it is, this is consistent with everything we've done in the past. So I don't think anything is different. It's just same old, same old for us. Okay. And I guess in terms of, thinking about the outlook for the margin, you talked about the plan to put some of the liquidity to work and I guess curious how quickly you think you can do that. And when I kind of go through some assumptions maybe we get to flat to maybe a little bit down on the margin, but we don't have the insight that you have in terms of how you put some of the liquidity to work. So maybe give us some help there. The margin could – well, it might go down a couple basis points. But again, you're at a point in time where the margin, you got to look at net interest income more than the margin. I think everybody gets hung up on the margin. I said I can't eat a margin, I can eat net – I can eat off net interest income. That's real money. If we have to – as the loan-to-deposit ratio comes down, if we grow, again if loans grow slower than deposits, which seems to be the case right now. We're putting those in investments. That will give us a great after tax return, great return on capital, no overhead associated with it, and still make, hopefully  $120 million (00:26:13) on assets which is accretive to where we've been right now after tax. So, I think you've got to change your focus off the margin to net interest income, which we think we'd love to see the margin go up where we're working like crazy to hold it steady, but it's kind of like a barometer, the net interest income is what we're most concerned with and that'll fall right to the bottom line and that's earnings per share and that's what we get paid for. So probably a little bit of pressure on the margin, but we believe net interest income should be up nicely this coming quarter. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense? It makes sense. I understand it, I guess, unfortunately people do look at that number, but I understand what you're saying. Well, I know they look at it because that's how they model it. But I think... That's right. ...we've been able in the past to manage and maneuver through times like this and put up record good quarters. The margin itself, sure we will, as I said we'd love to go up. We're working like crazy to go up. But, if your loan-to-deposit ratio does come down which we expect it to come down a little bit more to back in the 85% to 90% range, your margins are going to get hurt a little bit, but your net interest income is going to be just fine. So, we'd love to have loans keep up with it, but we're not going to do anything stupid right now. And we continue – our loan portfolio is growing nicely at – you know, for the year it's up over the single – high-single digits that we talked about, it's up 11.18%. Just deposits were up a little bit more. So we hope to be able to control the margin and really grow net interest income. That's our plan. Yep, yep. No, I've got it – and plus the acquired loans I understand that, that's coming on. So Dave, just a quick one for you, we ask about it every quarter, but mortgage banking typically see a bit of a tail off in Q4, but it sounds like maybe a little more optimistic, is that fair and any thoughts on volumes? Yeah. I think we're seeing a higher percentage of our applications recently be in the refinance area. So I do think you'll see some seasonality like we typically do on the purchase side. We're hoping that's offset on the refinance side right now, so maybe down just a tad. But I wouldn't expect it to be down dramatically and it could hold in there. We're just going to have to see how the refi volumes. They've been fairly strong recently, and so we expect to be strong – strong quarter, certainly probably more than what we had in the second quarter, but maybe just a tad off from the third quarter. But the crystal ball there Jon, as you know, as we close these things now and in a fairly short period of time, so until you start  (00:29:17) November and see what those applications are, you don't really have visibility for the full quarter. But right now, it looks like another really pretty consistently strong quarter. We're advertising and a lot, Jon. I mean, now that we've been able to get that application time close to a little bit over an hour, if you do it online, we're able to – our front-end has tested better than Rocket Mortgage's front-end and we believe that we – if we advertise properly, we can bring in a lot of new customers because it is easy to work with them. We are local and the local aspect of it is that we do have an issue if a guy jumps on and can walk you through and take care of you locally. So we hope to be – we – my goal is to beat up the seasonality aspect of this in the fourth and the first quarters. We'll see how good we are at it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Good afternoon guys. Hi David. On the deposit cost, when you look at the total deposit costs in the quarter, we were up about – you guys were up about 5 basis points and you talked about needing prime to change. We've gotten that now. As we're looking at just the deposit side of the equation here, what can we see in the fourth quarter into early 2020 on the total cost there? I'll give that to Mr. Dykstra. Well, some of this depends on mix and we've had specials in the CDs in the money market areas and so it's just kind of – a lot of it will depend on where the money comes in. I mean, if you look at our CD portfolio, the cost of that in the third quarter was 2.18%. The new money coming on, the rates paid in the last month was closer to sort of more like the 1.40% range. So we put in the repricing of the CDs in the press release. So if all things stay equal, that portfolio over time should be repricing down nicely, and we'll just have to see whether people placing their money there or in money markets, et cetera. But we haven't given them a specific number, but we certainly are working on – hard to get those numbers down. There was a lot of specials that we ran when we were opening branch in the early quarters that kind of carried through the second quarter and early part of the third quarter. So, as you climb up that ramp you have to come down the same amount to sort of offset it, and we're starting to bring that down. So we're optimistic that the rates are going to come down. I'm hesitant to give you exact basis point number. You know, David, interestingly in the last 15 months we've opened 15 branches almost $850 million in new deposits, new customers. Those come in I'd say probably 60% to 70% of that money comes in in the first six months subject to teasers and then the teasers run-off. So we're seeing that happen as the rates they reprice, we bring them down, but that's not bad for 15 months, and we still think the right-hand side of the balance sheet's the franchise and we get these people in, we got to give them a reason to come over, they come over. Our retention rates are extremely good on that, but now as those teasers are running off under repricing, you have to slowly bring up value on a given the Benz. So we bring them down and so we're doing that and there's – there are a number of customers that had specials. In other words, a guy with a big deposit, who's sold his business or whatever, he comes in, you gave him 2%. We're bringing those down to 1.5% and 1.25% on a key – you know and in almost every cases, but it's going to take a year to – or not a year, probably three, four months to get all that done. And the core rates come down right when the – when it happens, well, we can't come down 25 basis points, we're only paying  15 or 20 (00:33:54) on something, you bring them down a little bit. So, it's hard to give you that number because we – I don't really know how the – I know that through the specials that we can cut those by 75% – with 75 basis points, that'll be very helpful. So all-in-all, it should be very positive for us in that regard. And then the flip side is investing those assets, which we've done. So, we're already pretty much done with that. So I think we'll be okay. And I think there's a little – it's just a little – I think, if you think of this holistically, as Ed said early on, we have a fairly diversified business model here. So as rates have come down, the mortgage market reacts better, we've gotten good growth and growing the franchise and taking advantage of this market disruption. It's great to bring in those deposits and garner those households. We'll put that – those funds to work in the – down the road. We've worked in a low interest flat environment for a number of years, over the last decade. And so, we know how to deal with it. There's just a little lag here because we were really ramping – ramping up and getting good deposit growth to fund the good loan growth and the market turned quickly, so just a little bit of lag here. But the pieces are all working together as Ed said up – on the front end of the call and deposit pricing maybe lagged a little bit because of the specials we're running and the growth we were having, but it'll catch up here and we're working hard at it. It's not rocket science that when rates come down, you got to lower your deposit rates and we're doing that now. Got it. No, I appreciate the color. I know that's sort of the core to your – franchise value is the deposit side of the equation here so. The other question that I had and it relates to the liquidity management assets, and I think you said it was up $812 million in the quarter. Do you expect that to be up to the same extent here in the fourth quarter, or do you see that number coming down and did you disclose what maybe that impact was on the margin just having that $812 million that you pointed out? Well, I think the excess liquidity will cost us probably 7, 8 basis points. So  have (00:36:19) we put that at the work with probably 7, 8 basis points at least and then some of the cash that we did invest short-term probably was another 3 basis points, so probably 7 to 10 basis points for keeping it short. Okay. So, we're placing it in, what, 2.5% to 3% in investment securities. So again, six years is our – little over six years is our standard duration, but we're down to four years because of all this liquidity piling up, and so now that we know that its good and it's sturdy liquidity, we even returned $0.5 billion of brokered funds as a result, which should help the deposit costs. And then, we'll get the deposits in from these two acquisitions, which are good, sticky, low-cost consumer bases, which is going to be helpful. And we're not running as many new branch specials going forward. So, this will flow through the system and the rates will come down and we'll put the liquidity to work. And in the meantime the mortgage business is our internal hedge to that and it worked fine. I mean, we had record earnings this quarter. It worked fine, we expect it to work in the future, life's not linear and – but we have a plan and we will be – we are lowering rates and we expect to generate good net interest income as Ed said. Got it, cool. Thanks guys appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Hello, Kevin. So, I'm going to ask about the left side of the balance sheet. To what extent are you using floors as a way to protect your loan yields and if you can give us some color on why you're structuring them? On new deals, we try to get a floor all the time, but it's competitively hard to do. So we're living with that right now. On the life insurance funding we usually get floors, property and casualty is nine-month full payouts, so who cares. Leasing is usually fixed rate, mortgages are what they are. And the commercial side is what's left. And we get floors where we can. But none of our competitors are doing it. So, we live with that risk for the most part. Okay. And then as far as what we're seeing and what we're hearing of manufacturing, are your clients feeling the negative impact given what's happening from a geopolitical standpoint? Well, the line usage is down about 1.5%, so, well you can see a little bit of it taking place. It's interesting though if you think about the geopolitical side of things, trade – total trade – if you take total exports and imports is actually up, if you add them both together, it's pretty interesting that China might be down 30% or 25%, but Vietnam's up 30% and India's up 10% and Taiwan's up like 20%. Trade is still doing or is going okay. So we – our manufacturers are doing pretty well. What we're seeing though is people – everybody thinks if there's going to be recession, I find it hard to believe unless we talk ourselves into it that there will be one. I don't think recessions and full employment go together very well. But you never know, I'm not an economist. But our clients that we have are pretty well fortress balance sheets, we are lowering as I said, we got out of about $100 million of exit loans, the ones we wanted out this quarter are mostly in the HLT side of things. And we are doing that and we're trying to keep our customers, our clients in – and I said we lost about $198 million, actually it's between $90 million and $100 million to other companies usually FinCos who will allow much higher leverage. So we don't see that as the problem with our commercial C&I loans being flat. It's not the business side of things, maybe a 1.5% in terms of the draws, but all-in-all our clients are doing pretty well. And then Ed, you mentioned HLT, that's an area you've – you're shying away from, are there are any other areas in lending given where we are in the cycle that you're deemphasizing and then staying away from? Private equity firms, where we don't – where we don't have a general relationship with the PE guys. That's where we got in trouble last quarter, we've learned our lesson there. We're getting out of as many of those as we can. But that being said, our – you know we had a lot of business – businesses sold out. The good PE guys are harvesting right now. They're not buying, they're harvesting. So staying away from those and participations in those. And HLTs are – bringing them down a little bit. We never had that many to begin with, but your lenders go out there, they're like we'll seek the level of least resistance, maybe they'll bring an HLT, and we'll go, no, we really don't want do that. So we're trying to shy away from those in general. But really, we got out of retail commercial real estate over the last two years, we basically have brought that almost down by 60%, but that's been a two year project. But still commercial real estate is doing very well here with great sponsors and our growth there has been – has been very nice. So, but just in the very – in just these sectors where great sponsors, great equity  created (00:43:04) that sort of thing. So, we were diverse enough that something's not working, something else is. So we feel good about where we're going with our loan portfolio. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Hi Brad. Hi, good afternoon. Hi guys, how are you? Great. Just wanted to follow-up on the loan yield discussion, loan yields down 14 basis points linked quarter. You think that will be pretty consistent with subsequent reduction in Fed funds and LIBOR or anything else going on this quarter that may be made that compression better or worse than you thought it should have been. And then secondly just kind of curious, you know the new loans that you brought on this quarter kind of what types of rates are you seeing on those as they come on the books compared to the back book? Well, I think part of the issue, Brad, was I mean if you look at one month LIBOR and we disclosed in our press release how much is tied to one month LIBOR and we've got about $8.4 billion of our variable rate loans tied to that. So we got $25.7 billion of total loans and $8.4 billion tied to one month LIBOR. But one month LIBOR during the quarter dropped quite a bit. I mean it ended June up at $240 million and ended up at $ 202 million, so it's down 38 basis points. So that's one of the reasons you saw the decline in the loan yields, is a variable piece of that. And one year LIBOR, it was down 15 basis points in the third quarter and it was down 53 basis points in the prior quarter. So it's dropped a lot and our life portfolio is tied to that, although about – only about 1-12th of that portfolio reprices every month. So we're starting to see a little bit of that impact on the repricing. So it really was that the one month LIBOR just dropped much more precipitously than other rates and that caused a little bit of pressure. So if you can tell me where one month LIBOR is going to go, the rest of this quarter I can probably give you a better viewpoint on that, but I think it's – people can look at the math on that and look at where your LIBOR rates are going and make some conclusions of their own. I would be broke if I bet on interest rates, so we try not to do it. And what's coming on the books, our premium – commercial premium finance business is going very well. We've been able to hold our yields up there in the 5s. I think it may have been down about 5 basis points, 6 basis points, 7 basis points something like that over the last two quarters. But, the interesting there is that the average ticket size from a year goes up from $22,000 almost to $30,000. Again, so we're seeing pretty good growth there, without the commensurate increase in expenses. Thank God for hard markets. On the life side, we – the spreads have remained relatively consistent. The spreads have, but again it's  up (00:46:12) on your LIBOR. So, it's always been a competitive market. We have big banks pulls in and pulls out of that market and they come in and try to buy some, then they figure out that they don't know what they're doing and they get out. So, we have to maintain our business there, but the spreads have been relatively consistent there, like two over one year or something like that on average. The other thing is that your commercial real estate is holding up well and we put close to $100 million of residential mortgages on the books, $50 million of those were variable rate, waiting for conditions to clear. It's our hybrid product where if somebody had just went into business for themselves and got a loan, you can't sell that loan, put them in a variable rate product that's in the 4s. And then we booked $50 million of fixed rate stuff to kind of help us to bring the GAAP down. I think you'll probably see that going forward on the real estate side, on the residential real estate side. Probably $50 million net of new growth on the hybrid product and $50 million coming over on the  mod (00:47:32) return product, that help us with our GAAP position and to, it's nice to have, we do a $1.4 billion, pulling $50 million out of good stuff is okay, at good rates. And our GAAP position jumped up a little bit because of our liquidity that we had, we still want to maintain a positive GAAP, just because as rates go down the propensity for them to go up is higher than as we go down further. But we want to mitigate that to some extent by bringing it down from the 11% it is now down to back to where it was 6% – 5%, 6%. So does that make sense on that? Yeah, I think so. And then Dave just, the one follow-up on the mortgage business. I was writing quickly but I think I heard you say, you hope to hang on to the gain on loan sale margin. I think I also heard you say that you'd basically discontinue two of your correspondent network. Just kind of curious, the difference between kind of what you make on a loan sold out of the correspondent network versus out of your retail channel which obviously is more profitable. Yeah, well the correspondent channel is probably 20, 30 basis point margin. So you can and in the past maybe we did a $100 million, $150 million, $200 million of that and supplemented it. And there was reasons to do that, but we've just decided, we don't do wholesale and now we decided not to – we would just get out of the correspondent business based on those margins. So part of the reason for the aggregate increase in our gross margins was because we reduced the amount of correspondence, so next quarter it should be next to zero, there might just be a tab that carried over from some relationship that we – that we had, but not much at all, it should be very close to zero. So the margins on the Veterans First stuff is at high-3s to 4% depending on the products that they do, and then the retailers generally in the upper-2s or so. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. Dave or Ed, given the success you guys have been having with deposit growth, in particular in the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about the kind of the debt that's on the balance sheet? You've got about a $1 billion of higher cost debt. I'm just wondering if there's any thought to pulling one of those levers to support earnings  – the margin (00:50:10) in this environment given the momentum on the deposits? Well, not sure, if I understand your question, whether we would – would... Just pay up – pay off some of the borrowings or reduce the borrowing, given the higher rate? Yeah. Well, the borrowings are at the holding company level, Chris. So to pay those off, I'd have to dividend up a bunch of money from the banks you know or issue new debt. It's not debt at the bank level, its debt at the holding company level. Okay. So I don't have – you know ... It's debt – it's cheap capital is what it is for us, it's cheap – if we're making 12% on ROE and 14% ROT, we have 5% debt, after tax that's 3.5%, 3.70% something. It's just cheap capital for us. So unless we make a ton of money, we're going to keep using cheaper capital. Yeah. Got it. And if we make a ton of money, I'd rather buy my stock back as I pointed out to you many times. I know some people issue that debt at the bank level and I understand the question, but just at the holding level so I'd have – I don't have that much dividend capacity from the banks of $0.5 billion plus that we look at it as cheaper capitals than doing common or whatever. Got it. Okay. That's great clarity. Thanks. Given the top-line pressures that the group is facing, given lower rates, can you speak about protecting profitability through kind of expenses? I know you guys have been opening branches. You've obviously made the mortgage business more efficient, but just any steps as you kind of enter budget season that you might be looking at to kind of reduce the rate of growth on expenses? Thanks. Well, I think one of the things we tried to point out in the releases, even when the margin came down 25 basis points and as we said we think there's – it certainly is not going to decrease at that same rate because of this lag effect that we're going to be able to hopefully get on investing up the liquidity and reducing the deposits, but the net overhead ratio came down by almost the same amount. So if you can get the growth and get the operational efficiencies out of it, that's one way to offset lower margins, is to grow into  your close (00:52:42) a little bit more and just grow and invest that money as Ed talked about. So you could just sit down and start slowing the boat down and not invest in the company and cut expenses, you could, but there's a lot of opportunities in Chicago right now and a lot of disruption and we'd like to take advantage of that market disruption and take advantage of the growth. And so we think the – as Ed has said a number of times, we can grow through this and build the franchise at the same time. We'd rather grow into it and absorb that operational capacity versus start to cut and not grow and so on. Got it. That – and the acquisitions we're doing, they should have relatively great cost outs, which will help our net overhead ratio. And as you go on a budget season, the things you could probably lever, as you could pull your marketing lever back a little bit, nothing that would move  the Dow (00:53:43) that much, but we are telling everybody to try to get by on what they've got for a year. We'll see how that goes through the budget process, but I said if you're going to add somebody they got a – he's either got to be a critical piece or somebody who's going to make me money. We'll see the budget processes are ongoing and they're always arm wrestling, but our goal is always to just give you double-digit earnings growth and we'll pull every lever we can to get there. At the same time, it just seems you've got to grow through this thing right now. And we stopped the boat and had restarted again, it costs a lot more. So... Got it. Okay. And just one clarifying comment, the NII comment for Q4 I think you said it was going to be up nicely. Does that assume we get a cut later this month from the Fed or kind of what are your rate expectations built into that? Well, we get a cut later this month. It'll be – it won't be as good as we'd like it to be. Yeah I think, Ed, I think from my perspective, you know, we're not predicting whether it's going to be October or December or even if there's going to be one it's sort of as we stand right now, because we don't know whether – they could fix China and the one-month LIBOR for whatever reason pops a little bit, well, that would be helpful to us. So, we just don't know again what's going to happen with that one-month LIBOR rate. But they cut 25 basis points, that would add – that would be a little bit more problematic because – but it all depends really on what – the question there, Chris, is really how does the LIBOR react to that. If LIBOR stays flat, I got $8.5 million that doesn't do anything even a prime comes down 25 basis points. Right. Yeah. If they reduce prime and LIBOR goes down another 25 basis points, well, that's problematic. But I think the market is kind of ahead of prime, so we're not expecting that LIBOR to go down. So a roundabout way to say I'm not sure what the market dynamics are going to be between that relationship with LIBOR and prime. But I think the market's already kind of priced in the downward expectations for rate in the one month LIBOR already. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Terry. A question – hey. Dave, you mentioned earlier, you're spending money or you spent money on CSIL preparation. What's your updated thoughts around CSIL at the end of the year and the day one impact? Yeah. Well, we aren't in a position where we think we should disclose that number yet, or we're well along in the process, we've got the dry runs and the parallel runs and all that kind of stuff go on. But we just – we want to – we're well along in the process, we want to just get a little bit further and be a little bit firmer with it before we disclose it but – so I think the answer is, well along in the process we think we're in good shape on that, but not ready to disclose a number yet. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, are the retail deposit promotions a function of the market disruption today that you're seeing given, particularly the acquisition that occurred earlier in this year, or is it more of a bigger picture kind of over – strategy to build out the branches and just having to pay up for deposits, too, to support those branches and the expenses. And I hear you loud and clear, you can't eat the margin, but the investors eat on the stock performance and I just don't know how the margin sensitivity is going to go away anytime soon. So I think it's important to understand, why we saw a 5 basis point increase in deposits when these larger banks all week have been reporting lower deposits? And what is the core strategy around the deposit growth and the impact on the margin? Well, we have opened 15 new branches and we do put teaser accounts out there to get people in the door. They're bundled packages, so they open a checking and savings account, maybe it's safe deposit. So we  get a new (00:58:04) entire relationship. That's pretty cheap when you think about it. But – and these – and you kind of wean them down off of that over a period of a year. So that takes time, and that's about brought in a couple of billion dollars of that money to build out these branches. So that's the strategy. That plus if it's the market disruption the branches are doing well because of market disruption because we have great reputation  in town (00:58:37) and we won the J.D. Power Award two of the last three years for customer service. We won a lot of Greenwich Awards for commercials service. We've got great momentum. We got to take advantage of that. And the disruption on the commercial side has caused us to get new clients in the door from other banks in town and they might come with a lot of liquidity, and we might pay them a little bit up on that. Those are the specials, and about $1 billion of that that we're talking about and going from the  2s down to 1.5%, 1.25% (00:59:09), et cetera. So it is about growth, it is about enticing people to join us and that's how we – I've been doing that since 1991 when we opened the first bank. Got to give people a reason to leave, get them happy, they get in, they love the service and you get them for life. That's what we do. So we want – we believe our cost of funds notwithstanding another rate cut that we talked about earlier, our cost of funds should come down nicely this quarter and continue to kind of bottom out after that. So it just – they said for the retail, they don't know LIBOR, it takes time. We can have an excuse to bring it down. So everybody it's all hands on deck for that and that's what we're doing. So and I think – by the way investors should be more concerned about net interest income than they should about one number the margin, isn't it – you and I can have that discussion offline, but I think you want me to make more money, don't you? I'm not going to push back on that. Thanks for the insight, Ed. Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Race with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Hi, Nathan. Just going back to deposit cost questions. I'm just curious what the timing was in terms of the runoff of the brokered CDs in the quarter, and if there's any other opportunities to further optimize the deposit base, just given what you're seeing in terms of core deposit growth recently? You know most of that was earlier in the quarter, so rather the first month of the quarter that some of that went away. You know that there – on the margin, there's some other brokered funds that are out there that we're looking to see if we can replace, but some of it is term and you're committed to it. So – but, all-in-all our brokered rates are pretty low, Nathan. We don't rely upon the brokered funding that much. We're certainly down into the 4% – probably 4% to 5% range on brokered funds. So it's not a lot there deploying with anymore. Okay, understood. And then just changing gears a bit, the C&I growth was fairly soft this quarter for the first time in a while. So I'm just curious if that was partially related to some of the workouts that you had with some non-performers, or if it's just seasonal or just maybe perhaps less of an appetite to put on floating rate assets today? Well, if you look at the amount of payoffs as we had about $74 million payoff – actually $87 million paid off  by going into (01:02:05) another financial institution, that's about consistent with what we've done every quarter, we had about $100 million of exit strategies. That's about double the normal, and we had about another $100 million, where the businesses were sold and line usage was down 1.5%. So we still brought in a good deal of business, but we're getting offset with those types of paydowns, so. And I think, Nathan, second quarter was really a strong quarter for us, but the third quarter was – in new loans was fairly consistent with the first quarter and quarters prior to that. So the issue really is what Ed talked about is just an elevated level of paydowns and payoffs. Understood. I appreciate it. Pipelines are still very good. Pipelines are still very good. So, you can't always know when the customer is going to close the loan and the third quarter tends to be, we call it sort of doldrums around here at times, because borrowers are on vacation and lenders are on vacation. And sometimes things just get pushed back. So, we would expect a pretty decent fourth quarter based upon our pipeline. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks. I'm still kind of spun around about the NII. I mean it seems from what you're seeing, when I look at say one month LIBOR, average quarter-to-date one month is down say 30 basis points versus where it was in the third quarter. I know we don't want to talk about NIM, but it seems like NII could be flat to down modestly again in Q4? It just depends on what happens with the LIBOR rate over the quarter. We wouldn't have been down nearly this much if LIBOR wouldn't have gone down 38 basis points in the third quarter. And if you can tell me what's going to happen then we can do that. I think ... It's down 30 basis points. It's down 30 basis points right now in the fourth quarter, the average. And say it just stops right here. We're down 30 basis points at the end of the year? Well, the point – then you're going to have fresh on the asset yield and we're going to have to work hard on the funding side to get that cost down and then we're going try to grow through it. We're going have $800 million of growth come on through the acquisitions, we'll have other strong growth we believe through the lending side of the equation and continue deposit side and we'll try to grow through it as Ed said, so. And get the NII and eventually rates are going to stabilize at some point and you manage through the process. So we're going to have these short blips up and down in the LIBOR rates, but we're going to grow through it and we will get it stabilized, there's just a little bit of lag on the funding side. Okay. Is deposit pricing set centrally or is that set through the subsidiaries or a mix, mix of both? It's... It's approved centrally. Many of it is set centrally. Specials are obviously – are dependent upon – one of the beauties we have is we've got a branch of a bank of Wintrust Bank let's say we just opened there in Back of the Yards, or in Uptown, or Wrigleyville. We can price the deposit there on a special, but not cannibalize our whole organization. So one of the beauties of our multiple, charter multiple brand approach is that we can eliminate – limit cannibalization on our deposit base and really target our marketing there. So basically set centrally, approved centrally, but competitively they've got – some guys might have a guy in the market who's coming after them and we have to be flexible there, so. But generally it's all approved centrally and usually set centrally for the most part. Got it. Okay. I appreciate the color, guys. But can differ by charter. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Ruiz with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Peter? Peter, if your line is muted, please unmute. Looks like we go on to the next call. Let's go to David. And our next question comes from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Hey thanks. Couple of questions for you, I wanted to follow-up on the NII discussion. I guess and this question might be a bit specific, but what LIBOR level are you assuming for NII to be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? We're just assuming sort of the current state right now and adding them in the growth. Got it. And then, if we – you know with that as a backdrop looking out to 2020, do you think and I guess looking at the Fed funds futures, if we do assume, you know a 25 basis point cut at some point in the fourth quarter here and an additional 25 basis points in the first quarter of next year, do you think NII could be up in 2020 despite the NIM headwind? Yes. It depends on growth and we have – if you build then in the you know the $1.5 billion to $2 billion growth we've had every quarter, organically, plus the occasional acquisition. I think that we – it can be okay. You never know. As Dave said, you know it's who knows. I mean, it's a – lot of it's the relationships of the loans and of the rates themselves, the shape of the curve. What's working, what isn't working around here? That's the plan and we're working very hard on that and it's all I can say but theoretically you could have something that'll make it go down. You can have other things that may go up a lot. So where we want it to go up, and where we want to have double digit earnings growth without MSR evaluations and one timers, that's what our goal is and I'll know better when we get through the budget cycle at the end of the – in the next couple of six or seven weeks and go from there. But it's kind of hard to run all these different scenarios. We had Charlie Evans come out and say he doesn't see a need for another rate drop this year. So he's the head of the Chicago Fed. What scares me is if rates keep going down is it forms bubbles and bubbles don't help the economy and then all bets are off, if rates keep going down for a lot of different reasons people say when – would you go on the rope-a-dope again. Well, not now but if rates keep going down and the market gets stupid again we very well could, which then all bets are off. But to say with any certainty where you'd be, that's our goal, that's what we're shooting for. In the current rate environment we think we can do it, if rates move then it's going to be harder but, we got through the last one, okay. We'll get through this one okay. Yeah... (01:10:33) ...but it's just hard there's so many, you got political issues for God's sakes. Those are – those are huge. It's just there's so many variables right now. All we can do is control what we can control, do what we can do, if the market turns against us we could very well go into rope-a-dope but we don't see it now. We're still getting deals on our terms, we know we have to cut costs. We know that the beta going down is the same as the beta going up. We're got to get more demand deposits in here. We've been very fortunate to get the CDEC deposits that are back up to over $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion. Got $800 million on our books. So those are relatively cheap costs or funds for us and continue to grow that. So, a lot of levers to pull, but there's so many variables out there. It's just hard to say where you're going to end up. But we feel good, if the rates stay where they are right now. We have to go down a little bit, we think we can pull this off. So that's why we get the big bucks. That's helpful. I can definitely appreciate all the variables involved. Now, shifting gears back to loan growth. You mentioned about consistently strong pipelines and I think in your prepared comments you mentioned single-digit loan growth. Are we still looking for mid to high-single digits? Yeah, I don't think – we haven't seen our – we can put the qualifier on, we we'd still have that same cost. Yeah. Even though 11% this year which is, we didn't expect that to be. Single-digit, mid-single digit growth rates should be very good for us. That – we'd be happy to have it. Mid to high. Mid to high. Sorry. I just want to make sure, we're clear. Sorry. It's been a long call. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ed Wehmer for any further remarks. Thanks, everybody. We hope to talk to you again in January if not before, if you have any other questions on the quarter or what we're doing, where we're going, feel free to call me or Dave. Thanks a lot. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Eagle Bancorp, Inc. Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference to your speak today, Charles Levingston, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, Victor. Good morning. This is Charles Levingston, Chief Financial Officer of Eagle Bancorp. Before we begin the presentation, I would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K for the 2018 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, or future event, or development. Our periodic reports are available from the company or online on the company's website or the SEC website. I would like to remind you that while we think that our prospects for continued growth and performance are good, it is our policy not to establish with the market any earnings, margin, or balance sheet guidance. Now, I would like to introduce Susan Riel, the President and CEO of Eagle Bancorp. Thank you, Charles. I'd like to welcome all of you to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2019. We appreciate your calling in this morning and your continued interest in EagleBank. As usual, Jan Williams, our Chief Credit Officer, is also with us this morning. Jan and Charles will be available later in the call for questions. I'm pleased to announce that we achieved another quarter of strong profitability with net income for the third quarter of $36.5 million. While that is a decrease from our earnings of $38.9 million in the third quarter of 2018 and slightly below the second quarter of 2019, our profitability still ranks among the highest levels of community banks in the United States. Return on average assets for the quarter was 1.62%, and the return on average tangible common equity was 13.25%. We are also very pleased to report that with solid growth in loans, deposits, and market share during the quarter at September 30, we reached $9 billion in total assets. For the quarter, the earnings were $1.07 per fully diluted share as compared to $1.13 per share in the third quarter of 2018. As mentioned in the press release, there were two significant non-recurring expense items, which somewhat offset each other, so that exclusive of those items, our earnings for the quarter would have been $37.1 million or $1.08 per fully diluted share. I will discuss the details of the FDIC insurance credit and the changes to our board structure later in my remarks. Given the trend of margin compression across the industry, it is not surprising that the major factor influencing our profitability in the third quarter was the decrease of the net interest margin to 3.72% for the quarter. That was compared to 4.14% a year ago and 3.91% in the second quarter of 2019. Like many of our peers, our margin has been significantly impacted by the very difficult interest rate environment. We clearly felt the effects of the flat yield curve and the disconnect in the markets between the loan pricing and deposit rates. The decrease in the margin was attributable to several factors. The yield on our loan portfolio was 5.39% for the third quarter, as compared to 5.69% in the third quarter of 2018, and 5.61% in the second quarter of this year. The decrease in loan yields was related to both lower LIBOR rates during the period, which directly impacts 41% of our portfolio and the lower rates on new loans booked during the quarter. Loan pricing is very competitive in this market, especially as we have become more selective in the transactions we are booking. For the third quarter, we were able to achieve excellent growth in deposits, while keeping our cost of interest-bearing deposits at 1.89%, equal to the rate in the second quarter of this year. We reduced our composite cost of funds for the quarter by 2 basis points to 1.28%. Even with the strong deposit growth, we maintained DDAs at 30% of average deposit balances for the quarter. Most importantly, we have been seeing a softening in the pricing of deposits in the Washington region over the last couple of months and believe this bodes well for the fourth quarter. The margin in the third quarter was also impacted by a change in our asset liability mix. We work to increase our liquidity and reduce the loan to deposit ratio. During the quarter, we added $453 million in deposits without increasing our cost of funds rate. The additional funding was primarily core deposits, which went into NOW accounts and money market accounts. Average liquidity for the third quarter was $142 million greater than in the second quarter of 2019. And we had an average loan to deposit ratio of 102% for the quarter, which was an important objective. As we have said many times, at EagleBank, we do not focus on just one factor, but maintain our efforts on all of the key performance indicators. So, offsetting the decreased margin were continued strong contributions to profitability from the very favorable efficiency ratio, continued loan and deposit growth, solid asset quality and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.34% for the quarter on a GAAP basis, as we continued our prudent approach to expense management. As I mentioned earlier, there were two non-recurring expense items we recognized during the quarter. One was a credit of $1.1 million from a refundable FDIC assessment, which we had paid into the fund over nine quarters, dating back to 2016. The credit was received when the total FDIC insurance fund reached 1.38% of insured deposits. If the fund remains above the 1.38% target level, we will receive an additional credit of approximately $600,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The other non-recurring item was an expense of $2 million for acceleration of share-based compensation as certain Directors resigned, and the board of the company and the bank were consolidated and reorganized. We'll have some comments later regarding corporate governance. Exclusive of these two non-recurring items, the efficiency ratio for the third quarter would have been 37.95%. Even including the two non-recurring expense items for the third quarter, the ratio of non-interest expenses as a percent of average assets was 1.50% as compared to 1.58% in the third quarter of last year. While judiciously managing expenses, we continue to make the necessary investments in systems and personnel, and organizational structure, as we grow towards the $10 billion regulatory threshold. Legal, accounting, and professional fees were $3.6 million for the quarter as compared to $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2019, and $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. Legal fees related to the ongoing investigations were $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $700,000 for the second quarter of 2019. We expect that the legal fees related to these matters could remain at elevated levels at least through the end of 2019. In regards to the investigation, there isn't much we can say beyond the fact that we continue to fully cooperate with the various agencies. Most of the work is being handled by the law firms we have engaged. The efforts within the company are concentrated with few members of senior management so that we can continue to focus on providing exceptional customer service and growing the bank. I might add that there are no regulatory restrictions on our normal operations of the bank due to the investigations. As you know, we began our share repurchase program during the third quarter. We have previously received regulatory approval for that program. But before announcing and commencing the program in August, we went back to our primary regulator and verified their continued approvals. We are very pleased with the results to-date of the share repurchase program. From inception on August 9 through September 30, we repurchased 822,200 shares at an average price of $40.58 per share. Because the calculations are based on weighted averages, the program did not create much EPS accretion during the third quarter of 2019, but should have a more beneficial impact in the fourth quarter and going forward. The current repurchase program expires on December 31, 2019, and we will evaluate an extension of the program prior to that date. Another confirmation of the strength and consistent financial performance of the company is the recent announcement by the Kroll Bond Rating Agency that they have reaffirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+ for the company and A- at the bank level. During the third quarter, we generated loan growth of $167 million on a point-to-point basis, a growth rate of 2.3%. Average loans for the quarter showed an increase of 13% over the third quarter of 2018. The annualized growth rate of 9.2% we saw in the third quarter is in line with our strategic objectives. The total of new loans booked during the quarter was about $360 million, down from the average of $400 million over the last four quarters. The largest increase during the quarter was in CRE income-producing loans with a very small increase in ADC loans. While we continue to see strong loan demand in the market, we remain selective throughout the credit approval and monitoring processes. Loan pricing is very competitive, and we are sensitive to establish customers with whom we can structure high-quality loan transactions. EagleBank was built through relationship banking, and we continue to nurture and improve our bonds with our valued customer. The economy in the Washington area remains strong. While the pace of population and job growth has slowed from the torrid pace of 2017, it is steady at about 25,000 net new jobs per annum. And the new jobs are in the higher-income, white-collar positions. The tech sector continues to flourish in Northern Virginia. The most recent reports from the Fuller Institute at George Mason University indicate increases in both the  (00:13:45) and leading indicators for the Metropolitan Washington region. Average deposits for the third quarter increased 13% over the third quarter of 2018 and 6% over the second quarter of 2019. As I mentioned earlier, we made a concerted effort to build deposits during the quarter to add liquidity and to reduce the loan to deposit ratio. We still prefer to stay relatively short for the duration of our deposits. Average CDs as a percentage of average total deposits were 20% for the third quarter as compared to 19% at September 30, 2018. More importantly, DDAs averaged 30% for the third quarter of 2019. Our ability to retain and grow deposits demonstrate the value of our relationship-first approach to banking. During the last several months, our customer base has been tremendously supportive of the bank. We have had almost no account or deposit attrition during this period. I would like to commend our relationship managers, support staff and branch personnel, who have done a wonderful job of communicating with and providing outstanding service to our customers. We are very pleased to note the recent report from the FDIC on deposit levels and market share in the Washington metropolitan area. For the annual period ending June 30, 2019, shown in the report, EagleBank had deposit growth of 10.5%, while the increase for the entire market was 4.9%. We continue to grow market share. But with a share of only 3.2%, we feel there is still tremendous opportunity for organic growth in what many analysts consider to be the one of the best markets in the country. We increased our presence and visibility in the Washington area this week when we opened our new loan production office in Prince George's County. We are excited about the opportunities there and have staffed the new office with bankers who know that market. The key for us has been and still is that as we grow, we retain the feel and high-touch customer service of a community bank. That is what we continue to deliver through our relationship-first approach to the market. We are adhering to our basic ALCO strategy of maintaining our moderate position for rate sensitivity and avoid taking excessive interest rate risks over the long term. We are slightly asset-sensitive with the short duration in the loan portfolio and 60% of the loan portfolio in variable or adjustable rate loans. About 41% of the loan portfolio is indexed to LIBOR, which definitely hurt us in the third quarter, but we feel that it is the correct long-term strategy. We do have floors in the pricing structure of 42% of our loan, and they will start to kick in if short-term rates decline further. Non-interest income was a plus for us during the third quarter as it grew to $6.3 million as compared to $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2018. The gain on sale of residential mortgages was $2.6 million for the quarter as compared to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, and $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2019.This was the one area where we had a benefit from the decrease in rates during the quarter. The bank continues to maintain solid credit quality. At September 30, 2019, NPAs as a percentage of total assets were 0.66% as compared to 0.20% a year ago, and to 0.45% at June 30, 2019. Nonperforming loans were 0.76% of total loans at the end of the third quarter as compared to 0.22% at September 30, 2018, and 0.51% at June 30, 2019. The total of nonperforming loans at September 30 was $57.7 million, which included one loan in the amount of $16.5 million, which was brought current shortly after the end of the quarter. Excluding that loan, the total of nonperforming loans would have been 0.54% of total loans at September 30, and the NPAs would have been 0.48% of total assets. We continue to constantly evaluate the portfolio and take an aggressive approach to placing loans on nonaccrual status. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2019 were 0.08% as compared to point 0.05% in the third quarter of 2018. On an annualized basis, net charge-offs were just 0.12% for 2019 year-to-date. The allowance for loan losses was 0.98% of total loans at the end of the third quarter. The provision expense for the quarter was $3.2 million consistent with our allowance methodology, the current economic climate, and our minimal charge-off history. At September 30, 2019, the coverage ratio was 128%; 173%, excluding the cleared loan as compared to 452% at September 30, 2018. And we believe that we are adequately reserved. Since our last quarterly press release and earnings call in July, we have had the opportunity to touch base with many of our shareholders and our valued advisors about the status of the company. We have spoken about the realization that our company has been changing from the smaller, rapidly growing bank we were a few years ago to the more mature, perhaps a little slower-growing, but still a high-performing company. We have been working on and taking steps through the transition process for some time. In many instances, well before the retirement of Ron Paul six months ago and the new roles taken on by our Chairman, Norm Pozez, and myself, some of the activities you have seen in the last two quarters are the results of much planning and development, which we have now implemented. They include the payment of a cash dividend, which we reinstituted in the second quarter, are paying again for the third quarter, and plan to continue. It also includes the share repurchase program, which we commenced in the third quarter. These two items are clear recognition that we want to provide a return to you, our shareholders, in ways beyond just share price appreciation. We are also committed to maintaining a sound organization in all aspects. In July, we announced the strategic reorganization of the board, which combined with earlier changes to our committee structures, will enhance the board's ability to provide oversight of the company. As a larger organization, we are also revisiting our management committee structures, so as to better coordinate all important strategic and risk management matters. We also have discussed with pride the fact that the hit to the margin caused by the current interest rate markets – we are still highly profitable, well-capitalized and growing community bank. We were able to adopt the cash dividend and the share repurchase program because of our strong capital position. Even with the impact on capital of those programs over the past year, the total risk-based capital ratio improved from 15.74% to 16.08% at September 30, 2019. Over the same period, the tangible common equity ratio improved from 12.01% to 12.13%. I am going to close with one final but important statistic. Our profitability and capital management over the past year have led to growth in the tangible book value per share from $27.84 at September 30, 2018, to $32.01 today, an increase of 15%. Thank you again for joining the call this morning and for your continued support of EagleBank. That concludes my formal remarks. We would be pleased to take any questions at this time. And our first question will come from the line of Catherine Mealor from KBW. You may begin. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Catherine. Good morning, Catherine. I want to start with the margin and maybe dig into the deposit side. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what deposit costs have done in the most recent months or weeks, just given the recent fed cuts, and your expectations for your ability to lower maybe some of your money market accounts in as soon as the fourth quarter? Thanks. Sure thing, Catherine. This is Charles. The deposit rate in our market have shown a little bit of softening here in recent weeks. That's something that we've learned in talking to other folks around the country, have happened in other markets. Unfortunately, in our market where all the banks here are so loaned up, the competition tends to remain fairly stiff. Although, again some of those stubborn rates are starting to soften up. So, my expectation is that we will, and we actually have already made changes to our money market rates. And we'll continue to do so, as a probability for another rate decrease looks pretty good at the end of this month. I think it's about an 86%. So, I would expect there to be some savings in terms of funding costs going forward in the near term. So, your money market right now – or savings on money market are 1.85%. Where would you say they are today? Right. We're just over 1% on the top-tier money market accounts at this point. And often, you hear about this notion that once rates fall below 1%, it tends to change the landscape a little bit. So, yeah, that's right where we are in our top tier. Okay. I'm sorry. Right at 1%, you said? Just above 1%. Sorry, my phone keeps ringing. Say that one more time. Just above 1%. Just above 1%. Okay. Great, great, great. So, I mean, as we think about next quarter, I mean, directionally, do you feel like we still have more NIM compression as LIBOR still pushes loan yields down, but we don't get a commensurate decrease in deposit costs quite yet? Right... I guess, directionally, how are you kind of thinking about where the margin goes from here? Sure. Yeah. I would not be surprised to see some additional compression in the margin in the near term. However, I would not expect them to be as dramatic as we saw between the second and third quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position where it is today, which certainly played a role. We do have CDs that on a weighted average basis have about a 12-month weighted average life. And those – we'll be re-pricing those CDs that we put on over the last year, so we'll be re-pricing. We also have – as we talked about, our money market rates had been brought down and re-pricing those deposits as rates continue to drop. We also have floors on our loans. So, on the other side of the balance sheet, we do have a little bit of protection. I think another 25 basis point move, and we'll be pretty much sitting at the floors. And if there's yet another move down at the end of the year, we'll see the benefit of some of those rate decreases spilling into 2020. So, that's a little bit of color around my expectations for the margin. But yeah, to your point, I wouldn't be surprised to see a little bit more compression, but I would expect some stabilization going into 2020. Great. Okay. And on loan growth, how do you think about a fair pace for loan growth next year? It feels like – you made a comment that you're now kind of transitioning to be a highly profitable, but more mature company with kind of slower growth than you have historically. So, what level of growth do you feel like is appropriate this part of the economic cycle and given your size? Catherine, we are still projecting a high-single-digit growth rate. We think that's where we'll be comfortable at. And within that high-single digit – can you talk a little bit about your focus on where you're pulling back in terms of loan types and where most of that growth will come from? I would say, we're being far more selective on construction loans. So, we're not out of the construction lending business, but we're being far more selective than we have been. Restaurants and hospitality, we're being very cautious with also. Got it. Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Catherine. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Casey Whitman from Sandler O'Neill. You may begin. Good morning. Good morning, Casey. Good morning, Casey. Good morning, Casey. First, just wanted to ask on the tax rate. That ticked up the last two quarters or so. Is 28% a good rate to use going forward, or could we see some relief? Yeah, I think, in the fourth quarter, I would expect that tax rate to remain relatively around the same area. But a lot of those expenses associated with Ron's retirement. And the lack of deductibility of those expenses will be lost going into 2020 and I think will normalize back around the 26% area going forward, beyond that. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Just thinking about expenses. So, if I just look at maybe the salary and benefit line this quarter, if I exclude the one-time costs, you had a pretty nice relief there. I guess, what do you attribute some of that decline to? And then, I also just wanted to get a sense for how talent attrition has gone over the last several months through some of the outside noise. I mean, have you been able to keep all the lenders, or just kind of give us an idea of how your talent attrition has gone? We have had turnover. I mean, we're in a business where there is turnover. We're always looking  at (00:30:59) bringing on people, and there are people unfortunately that leave. Sometimes, that turnover is good. We have attracted some good people. We have a strong team in both the lending team and the support areas, and we're continuing to build on that. We are looking to fill some critical high-level senior management positions. And we have some good leads in that area also. Okay. Yeah, I think, Casey, in terms of the cost, here we are kind of getting towards the end of the year. And some of those incentive accruals that we're making are being trued-up based on our expectation for production towards the end of the year, which lead to the result that you see in the financials today. That's part of it. Got it. I guess – and bigger picture, I mean, do you think you can keep holding the efficiency ratio below 40%, as you incur maybe some elevated costs related to going over $10 billion, or with other continued IT expenses you guys kind of referenced, or I guess can you keep the efficiency ratio this low, or should it tick up a little bit? We think, Casey, that it may pick up a little bit, but will be 40% or below. We have spread the costs of going over the $10 billion mark over a period of years. So, last year, we did some... Yes. ...we did some this year, we'll add some more next year. So, we have been prudent in that and not taking the hit all at one time. So, we do expect that the efficiency ratio will still be at a 40% or lower. And also keep in mind, we are saddled with some of these additional legal expenses at this point that that we hope to put it to a different use going forward in terms of those expenses. So, in terms of, again growing towards that $10 billion, adding the infrastructure, adding people, growing out our risk management apparatus. So, yeah, I would agree with Susan that 40% or below is the expectation. Yes. Okay. Great. I'll just ask one more question and let somebody else hop on. Maybe, Jan, just a little bit of color on that one nonperforming loan that was brought current. How long was it on nonaccrual? What was the loan type or location? Any kind of color you can give us would be helpful. Sure, Casey. It was one loan in a prime location on Wisconsin Avenue that had matured and wasn't promptly addressed. When it was addressed, the documentation and the funding didn't come in until after the 30th. So, it was never on nonaccrual, but it was over 90 days at September 30. So, we included it in the over 90-day category. It's a 60% loan-to-value property. It's really terrific location, so I don't have concerns from a credit standpoint. We just weren't able to get it re-documented and cleared by the end of the quarter. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Yes. Thanks, Casey. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery. You may begin. Thanks. Good morning. Jan, I just want to continue along the same lines with you. What's new on the classified fund and criticized? Are those trends going to be similar to what we saw last quarter? And do they kind of directionally follow what we saw in the NPAs at 9/30? There's not going to be a tremendous amount of shift, but there is a bit. You might recall that we had a number of loans that were included as a result of one of our customers that had a number of projects with us, the Hitt transaction, which you may have read about, Todd Hitt. We're in good shape, but it's still in receivership. So, those loans are being carried in that substandard category. Any time that a loan becomes nonperforming or goes over 90 days, we're automatically downgrading to a substandard level. So, you're going to see that $16.5 million in there this quarter. Typically, we don't have a ton of migration at any given time, but one loan in the $20 million range can make a big difference in what our average risk rating is. It's down about 1% in terms of the criticized and classified portfolio or the average risk rate – and I'm sorry, down about 1%. The criticized and classified portfolio has grown by about – oh, gosh, $22 million in the last quarter. So, a lot of it is going to be moving back out of there as we progress through these. So, net-net, it sounds like you've got some incoming and some outgoing, but not materially. Yes. Got you. Okay. Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. And Charles, just quickly for you, does the wholesale sort of dependency get incrementally better because you have the deposit growth this quarter, and then, obviously the loan-to-deposit ratio just ticked down? I mean, does that just sort of – liquidity ratios just get better because of the success in Q3? Yeah. I think you'll see that we had a little bit of reduction. As we measure our core deposits, and now, I think, as a result of the regulatory relief, the reciprocal deposits being included as core, generally, we did see a little bit of improvement there. So, yes, I think that's the right view. Okay. Great. And then, last question, how do your typical prepayments work in this type of environment? Do they generally help you, or does it create more of a turnover just with customers wanting to refinance as rates go low? I'm just kind of curious on structurally, if the way that you're set up sort of helps you with the customers. I think we generally get the first bite at the apple, if a customer is looking to have their rate decrease, either through a refinance or a modification. So, we try to take a realistic look at the market and the customer in a particular deal, focus on our risk-based return and our pricing policies, and whenever possible, retain that customer, looking at the full relationship. There are some times when customers are with us, say, through construction and stabilization, and they're ultimately going agency. That's a situation where we may have rollover. I think in the past, you've seen that churn in the portfolio on the construction side. And one of the benefits to adding the income-producing portfolio at a more rapid rate is that we do have a longer stabilization period. Most of those loans carry prepayment penalties, though we're not as vulnerable on those either. But we tend to retain our customers based on our relationships if we can be competitive on the pricing. Great, Jan. Thank you very much for the background. I appreciate all of those this morning. Sure. Thanks, Chris. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Comery from G.research. You may begin. Hey. Good morning. Good morning, Steve. Hey. Deposit growth is really strong this quarter for you guys, kind of a big tick up from what we've seen in past quarters. Was there anything you guys were doing differently, or was the market different, or was it just a lot of wins came this quarter? Yeah, I attribute it to continual development of relationships with our customers. There's certainly a market element there as well. Folks are getting perhaps a little skittish about late cycle moving more into cash. And that could certainly have a play – play a role in some of that movement. Okay. Yes. Thanks for that. And then the other thing that was really positive, I think, this quarter was the tick up in loan sales. Was there anything going on there other than like mortgage volumes were higher, so there was more there to sell, or were you guys taking share, was there anything else there? No. No. I think it was simply a product of tracking – with that 10-year treasury rates were down and volumes were up. So, yeah, we did see some benefit from that this quarter. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thanks, Steve. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Zwick from Boenning & Scattergood. You may begin. Erik, your line may be on mute. Good morning. Are you able to hear me? We are. We can now... Hi, Erik. Great. Thanks. With regard to the changes in the board room this year, the reorganization, and then more recently, the departure of three members. Two questions, I guess, first, are there any near-term plans to add any additional board members? And second, what initiatives or priorities are top of mind with the board today? We are always looking for new Board Members and the skill sets that will help us to fill in some of the gaps that we might need on the board. We have a strong candidate at this point that we're expecting to make an offer to in the very short distance. We don't have a goal on how many Directors we would have. I mean, we've always been told 18 were too many Directors. So ,we don't have a goal for numbers. Just when the opportunity comes up to get a good, qualified Director, we will make a move on that. Okay. And then in terms of, I guess, with the board being smaller now, I mean, everyone I guess, maybe gets a little bit more opportunity to kind of voice their preferences. I guess, any changes or any adaptations to initiatives or priorities that the board is looking at today? No. I would say, we've always had outspoken Directors. So, even though we had 18, they were always very involved and outspoken and involved with the bank. So, no, we don't have any problems with any of that. We're trying to just build the board with the right skill set, as we move into a larger organization and can better meet the expectations of the regulators and our shareholders with that board. Maybe just kind of one follow-up there. As the company does grow and become more mature, does the skill set that you look for change with a potential board member or new hire? Not totally, but there are some, like now, we're looking at adding a Risk Committee, which, as we move past the $10 billion mark, that is something that is recommended, not required. And one of the Board Members that we recently brought on, Theresa LaPlaca, will head up that Risk Committee. So, giving us the opportunity to bring on people that are qualified to do things like that is a key objective for us. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Susan Riel for any further closing remarks. Okay. I want to thank everyone again for being here and attending today, and look forward to talking to you at the next quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the People's United Financial, Inc. Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Liz and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People (sic) [People's] United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our third quarter 2019 results are Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, President; Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack. Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on slide 2. Our third quarter performance, which reflects another quarter of record earnings, further demonstrates our success and strengthening the earnings power of the company while continuing to build the franchise for the long term. As such, we are pleased to report operating earnings of $135.5 million, an increase of 19% from a year ago and an operating return on average tangible common equity of 14.4%. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.34. Third quarter results were highlighted by a net interest margin of 3.12%, which was unchanged from the second quarter despite declining interest rates. The margin benefited from our proactive management of deposit costs and new business yields remaining higher than the total portfolio yield. The margin through nine months is 3.14%, well within our full year outlook range of 3.05% to 3.15%. Total revenues of $454.7 million increased both linked quarter and year-over-year and continued to benefit from strong non-interest income. Modestly higher expenses compared to the second quarter drove a 100 basis point increase in the efficiency ratio to 56.8%. Our ability to enhance operating leverage is evidenced by a year-to-date efficiency ratio of 56.6%, an improvement of 160 basis points compared to the prior year period. Our thoughtful approach to expense management has enabled us to control costs, while continuing to make important investments in our digital capabilities. We have launched several mobile device and online driven offerings this year, some of which we have discussed previously, including a residential mortgage and home equity lending portal, an enhanced deposit account opening solution, a direct-to-client investment platform and a more advanced peoples.com website. Our latest offering is a digital small business solution for loans of $250,000 or less which we'll roll out this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to partner with fintech companies to bring greater efficiency, ease of use and scale to our suite of digital products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Moving on to loans, period-end balances increased $224 million or 1% from the end of the second quarter driven by solid commercial loan growth partially offset by a planned reduction in residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. The growth in the commercial portfolio was primarily due to mortgage warehouse lending, equipment finance and Boston commercial real estate. Period-end deposits declined $893 million or 2% partially due to a second quarter ending balance including a $500 million short-term commercial deposit which was withdrawn in July as expected. On an average basis, deposits were down 1%, primarily driven by lower savings and time balances, partially offset by increased non-interest bearing deposits. Despite the decline in balances, we continue to be pleased with our ability to gather deposits. Recent FDIC data confirm we maintain strong market share in each state in which we operate and continue to hold the number one position in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the state of Vermont. We are particularly pleased our market share in Massachusetts is now in the top 10, driven by the addition of Belmont along with organic growth, we moved up four spots to number nine. The acquisition of United Financial is on track to close in the fourth quarter and we remain confident in achieving the transaction's attractive financial returns. The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time tested acquisition approach. The addition of United bolsters our already significant share of retail households and commercial clients across Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. We are excited for their long tenured well-established customer base to join People's United, and benefit from our broader array of products, services, and technology offerings. Before I pass the call over to David to discuss the quarter's results in more detail, I wanted to share some thoughts on the operating environment. Looking ahead, our view is customers continue to manage their businesses thoughtfully and are looking to take advantage of opportunities to grow. We continue to see areas of meaningful growth particularly in Boston and Metro New York, as well as in our equipment finance and specialty businesses. However, uncertainty about the economy whether trade related or recessionary fears is concerning the marketplace. Additionally, heightened competition remains notably in commercial real estate and our expectation is this will not abate in the coming year. Despite these economic and competitive uncertainties, we are cautiously optimistic about loan growth. We have broadened the capabilities of the franchise through strategic investments in talent, and enhanced digital offerings, while also adding retail households and commercial clients through thoughtful acquisitions. While we have grown in size, we remain true to our roots as a bank with significant local knowledge and the ability to provide tailored solutions to meet the individual needs of our customers. This solutions' oriented approach to banking differentiates People's United and positions us well to take advantage of growth opportunities in any environment. It is also evident margin compression will be a headwind in 2020 but the extent of which will largely be dependent on potential changes in the Federal Reserve monetary policy. However, we remain focused on managing what we can control to offset the effects of declining interest rates. These levers include continuing to remix the asset side of the balance sheet by reducing lower yielding residential mortgages, growing our higher yielding commercial loan portfolios, managing deposit costs proactively, continuing to build our fee income businesses, capturing revenue and expense synergies of recent acquisitions and sustaining excellent asset quality. Our long-term approach to managing the business has and will further enable us to generate value for shareholders and customers regardless of the uncertainties in the operating environment. With that, here is David. Thank you, Jack. Third quarter financial results were highlighted by a stable net interest margin, continued strong non-interest income, well-maintained expenses and a lower effective tax rate. Turning to slide 3, net interest income of $348.7 million was up $600,000 from the second quarter. Net interest income benefited $5.4 million due to improved deposit pricing and lower balances as well as $2 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. Conversely, the loan portfolio reduced net interest income by $3.7 million due to the downward re-pricing of floating rate loans. In addition, increased borrowings and lower yields in the securities portfolio negatively impacted net interest income by $1.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As displayed on slide 4, net interest margin of 3.12% was unchanged from the second quarter despite declining interest rates. As Jack referenced in his comments, the margin benefited from our proactive management of deposit costs and new business yields remaining higher than the total loan portfolio yield. Improved deposit pricing favorably impacted net interest margin by 5 basis points, while the additional calendar day added 2 basis points. The largest offset to these increases were lower yields in the existing loan portfolio, which reduced net interest margin by 4 basis points. Increased borrowings and lower security yields unfavorably impacted the margin by 2 basis points and 1 basis point, respectively. Turning to loans on slide 5. Average balances of $38.3 billion, increased by $88 million or less than 1% from the second quarter. On a period end basis, loans ended the quarter at $38.8 billion, up $224 million or 1% from June 30. Commercial period end loans grew $505 million or 2%, primarily driven by mortgage warehouse lending, equipment finance and Boston commercial real estate, partially offset by $89 million of runoff in the New York multifamily portfolio. Conversely, retail period-end loans declined $281 million or 2%, mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages, as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. Mortgage warehouse lending benefited from the decline in the interest rates, which increased refinance and mortgage purchase activity. Balances ended the quarter at nearly $1.7 billion, up $429 million from the end of the second quarter. Equipment finance grew $125 million primarily reflecting further strong production by LEAF. Furthermore, our commercial real estate business in Boston continued to benefit from the momentum generated by the addition of the Belmont team. Moving on to deposits, period end balances declined $893 million or 2% partially due to second quarter ending deposits including a $500 million short-term commercial deposit, which was withdrawn in July as expected. On an average basis, as displayed on slide 6, deposits decreased $554 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in savings of $304 million and time balances of $142 million, partially offset by an increase in non-interest bearing deposits of $171 million. Interest bearing checking and money market balances declined $279 million of which approximately $250 million is related to the withdrawal of the large short-term commercial deposit. It's important to note that non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits improved to approximately 24% from 22% at the end of the second quarter. We remain focused on controlling pricing as evidenced by a 4 basis point reduction in deposit cost during the quarter, which marked the first quarterly decline since the third quarter of 2016. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we proactively lowered CD deposit cost two times in the two months leading up to the Fed's July 31 rate cut, and then we subsequently lowered money market rates twice in the quarter. Non-interest income of $106 million marked another strong quarter. Although down $300,000 linked quarter, the results are up $13.7 million or 15% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-interest income of $307 million is up nearly 11% compared to the prior year period. On slide 7, the components of the linked quarter variants are displayed. Non-interest income in the third quarter benefited from $1.6 million in higher commercial banking lending fees, driven by increased commercial real estate prepayment income. $1.6 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals. A $600,000 increase in bank service charges, primarily resulting from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and higher operating lease income and investment management fees, which collectively improved non-interest income by $500,000. The largest driver offsetting these increases was lower customer interest rate swap income, which was down $2 million from a record second quarter. Non-interest income was also unfavorably impacted by a $2.6 million decrease in other fee income, which is primarily driven by the mark-to-market of one equity security position and normalized BOLI income. On Slide 8, non-interest expense of $281.4 million increased $3 million linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $5 million of merger-related costs in the following categories; $3.7 million in professional and outside services; $800,000 in compensation and benefits; and the remaining $500,000 in occupancy and equipment and other. In comparison, the second quarter incurred $6.5 million of merger-related costs. Excluding merger-related costs, non-interest expense of $276.4 million was up $4.5 million or 2% linked quarter. The largest component of the increase was $8 million in higher other expenses driven by several items, most notably certain legal and other one-time operational costs. The primary offsets to these increases was a $2.5 million reduction in compensation and benefits, resulting primarily from lower payroll cost and a $1.2 million improvement in regulatory assessments attributable to an FDIC credit. Turning to slide 9, the efficiency ratio of 56.8% increased 100 basis points from the second quarter due to a modest increase in expenses. Year-over-year, the efficiency ratio was up only 10 basis points. Despite the increase in the third quarter, we are very pleased with the significant progress we have made, enhancing operating leverage as evidenced by the year-to-date efficiency ratio of 56.6%, which improved 160 basis points from the prior year period. Asset quality was once again exceptional across each of our portfolios as demonstrated on slide 10. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points was unchanged from the second quarter and remain below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points increased slightly from an already low level and continued to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets. Briefly on slides 11 and 12, return on average assets improved 1 basis point linked quarter to 105 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity decreased 10 basis points to 14%. On an operating basis, return on average assets was also 105 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was 14.4%. As you can see on slide 12, capital ratios remained strong, given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. Before opening up the call for questions, I wanted to make a few comments on CECL. Our implementation efforts are progressing according to plan as we prepare for adoption on January 1, 2020. Based on current forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances at the end of the third quarter, the impact of CECL upon implementation could result in an increase of as much as 15% to 25% or approximately $40 million to $60 million to existing reserves. This increase is driven primarily by higher reserve requirements associated with the company's longer duration retail portfolio, partially offset by shorter duration commercial portfolios, and our low historical loss experience. As a result, the current estimated impact on capital ratios for both the bank and the holding company is a decrease of approximately 10 to 15 basis points. It is important to note, these estimates which are subject to further refinement in any potential change in economic outlook before year-end do not include the impact of the United acquisition. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions.  Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Hi, everybody. Hey. Hi, Steve. So you clearly did a nice job of lowering deposit rates in the third quarter. How much further do you think you could reduce deposit rates here in 4Q? And tied to that, what's the outlook for the NIM here near term? I'll start with the latter part of that question, Steve. Our experience has been that a 25 basis points move in either the Fed funds rate or one month LIBOR equates to 3 to 4 basis points of NIM compression. We appreciate your comment on being proactive on deposit cost management. There is another move in the end of this month, we would expect to be able to move deposit costs in both CDs as well as money markets down commensurate with what we did in the prior two moves. That's not a full 25 basis points but that's in the range of about 15 basis points give or take. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the loan side, given the remixing you're doing, when does this headwind move behind you and when should we start to see stronger reported loan growth? That's going to take a while, Steve. First of all, we do have the headwind of New York multifamily, right, which we guided last quarter to $200 million to $300 million for the year. It's been $175 million year-to-date. Every 1% decrease in that residential mortgage portfolio is just about $400 million. So the full remixing of our existing portfolio today or at the end of the third quarter is probably a few year event. However that doesn't mean there's not going to be loan growth over that time period. Yeah. Obviously, building the commercial portfolios is going to be very market opportunity dependent. Some of them are growing nicely at a good steady pace but others are facing the headwinds we talked about especially real estate, the biggest one. Thank you for that. And then just a big picture question on M&A, so you guys have done several nice M&A deals, have been in market, cost saves are strong, earn back is short. With that said, the market's not responding M&A the way it used to, right, even for your deals. Right. Do you guys start to think differently about M&A as a tool to create shareholder value given the dynamics around it? I would say no. The decline in interest rates is something we're paying a lot of attention to in terms of our thoughts around M&A, pricing et cetera. But if you just look at the M&A we have done with the metrics that you described and then think about building deposit households in those markets where we have presence and gaining market share and gaining the opportunity to deepen those relationships, we think that's all been very valuable and will continue to pay dividends for us. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Sure. You're welcome. Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thanks. Hi, Ken. So I guess maybe starting off in terms of fee income. I know you guys didn't include your outlook slide for the year in your slide deck but – so any comments on why you pulled that, that would be helpful. But the question in terms of fee income, I think your guidance was up couple percentage points but it seems that the $106 million level that you're posting is kind of meaningfully above the sort of 2% to 4% growth that you had previously outlined in your slide deck. Is $106 million the right level for fees or there are still unusual items in there? Thanks. Sure, Ken. So I go back to our – we had a little discussion on the call last quarter where we said that we had a strong second quarter at $106.3 million. We decided not to raise guidance just because of the variability of some of those drivers. But we did say that we would likely be at the high end of guidance or maybe even over. Now with another quarter at $106 million, I would say, yes, we will definitely be over the original guidance. B, I wouldn't go so far as to say $106 million is a sustainable run rate just because of the volatility of some of the capital markets activities. But away from that, we continue to be highly focused, as Jack said in his comments, on growing our insurance business, our capital management business, our wealth management business, which are much more steady performers and then we'll have some good capital markets quarters as well. Gosh. Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question. In terms of CECL, I really appreciate the additional clarity you provided in terms of the impact of CECL. But I'm not sure how to phrase this exactly, but what's the ultimate impact? I mean, I get it's 10 basis points to 15 basis points of capital, presumably there's the three-year phase in, on – from a regulatory standpoint. I mean does it matter that you are going to increase reserves $40 million to $60 million? Is there any negative impact from, whether it's rating agencies or anything else that I can possibly think of that – that we should as the sort of the sell- and buy-side community be paying attention to? It's a good question. That's a question we talk about internally here as well. So CECL is an accounting exercise, right? That $40 million to $60 million in our opinion is not a reflection of additional risk within that portfolio. It's a different way that we are now required to model and provision in a new accounting regime. (00:27:59) And I would say, it makes it harder for all of us, you guys, investors as well as  (00:28:07) Okay. But it doesn't change any way of whether you're thinking of buybacks or loan growth or anything. There's no impact to that, it's – other than on the balance sheet, of course. Right. Okay. We will not operate our bank any differently or think about credit any differently than we do it today. All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Your next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Hey, Jared. Hi. Good evening, guys. Hi. I guess not to beat a dead horse but sticking with CECL for a minute here. When you look at the UBNK deal, was that structured with CECL in mind or is there going to be an incremental mark in excess of that, 1.8% mark you put on there because of sort of a double accounting. Will that impact UBNK and will that impact the sort of economics of the deal? So, we'll partially answer that question. We have obviously – when we worked on that deal, we were very thoughtful of the impact that we would eventually have to account for that transaction under CECL methodology. But with that said and an expectation that we will close it this year, we're really not going to comment and the estimates we just gave were exclusive of United. Inclusive of Belmont because they were on the books at the end of the quarter, but we're not going to make any comment on CECL relative to United. Okay. I guess, does CECL now being out there change the way you're viewing M&A as a strategy in and of itself? Does that make it harder to make a deal work in your mind or again sort of like putting loans on the books so it doesn't fundamentally change the way you look at M&A? Yeah, I would say the answer is no and I would go back and reference what Jack said about the thoughtful M&A we're doing is a long-term perspective about gaining market share, getting and growing new customer bases. And so an accounting – new accounting regime will change the reported deal metrics in the short term but it's not going to change that strategy and really CECL is very transaction – bank transaction deal specific. Okay, perfect. Jared, this is Jack. I would say one common view I've heard in the industry discussions is that CECL and the requirements for longer duration, greater reserves for longer duration portfolios is likely over time to discourage banks from holding residential real estate loans on their books for instance. And that would seem to be logical and it makes you then wonder whether if the economics change and maybe rate expectations, spread expectations change on certain types of lending because of that... (00:31:40) ...which seems very counter to the idea that a change in accounting approach would drive one of the least risky businesses to higher reserves, but that's what it's doing. Okay. And then just finally for me, you had mentioned there could be broader market concern, I guess, around the economy. How do you view growing the equipment finance and some of the other, I guess, specifically equipment finance lending in light of that? Do you feel that you want to slow that down if we think that we're coming to the belly of the cycle or the beginning of the end of the cycle or is that you're still expecting to see good growth in that over the next year? Well, right now, we are expecting the economic activity to remain somewhat in the – at the levels and in the zone it's in, if you will. So there's nothing in the data that's telling us that GDP is going to slow or that unemployment is going to increase and the consumer is going to slow spending. There's a piece of information like the manufacturing data for instance once in a while, but generally, we feel that we're not on the verge of a recession and we're certainly not changing our approach to any of the businesses including equipment finance. We have studied and know that the equipment finance portfolio, we expect will do well when challenged in a recessionary environment, but the growth will slow as small businesses slow their borrowing in those environments. Great. Thanks a lot. Yeah, you're welcome. Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Casey. Wanted to follow up on the NIM. I think we're all kind of impressed by the loan yields holding up. Was wondering, was there a pick-up in purchase accounting on the quarter? Very modest, about $2.5 million linked quarter. Okay. Yeah, okay. And on a round, up maybe a basis point to the NIM, but was not a driver. Got you. Okay. And then, so the resi mortgage reduction, did you get the low hanging fruit or is there more opportunities to do that or any other balance sheet restructurings to help defend the NIM going forward? What really happened in the residential mortgage portfolio has been our strategy for the last three quarters, which is really to be less aggressive on origination rates, so working for wider spreads. The reduction was larger in the third quarter just because the level of interest rates dropped and refi activity picked up so much. So we had a substantially greater number of loans pay off, and we just slowed the flow of replacement, but that working for wider spreads is definitely the objective. That's how we will manage the pace of the  (00:35:24). Okay. And just following up on the deposit side. You guys obviously did a good job in being proactive. The loan to deposit ratio did tick up over a 100%. I know you had that big deposit kind of walk out the door, but what – can you just give us some thoughts on your ability to be – to continue to be proactive with the loan to deposit ratio above a 100%? Yeah. If you put the clock back three, four years ago, we had quite a long period of time, we were over 100%, and we talked about how hard we were working to grow deposits. In this quarter, I would – besides the $500 million commercial customer that outflowed, the loan to deposit ratio was impacted by the growth in our mortgage warehouse, which hit a record level of almost $1.7 billion. That will subside and take a bit of that pressure off over time. Obviously we manage on a week to week basis the commercial, retail, and government banking deposits relative to the cost and the  volumes (00:36:43). So, we always strive to keep that number below 100%. Almost every quarter we do, it slipped up 1% this quarter. Okay. Great. And just last one for me. Just – you mentioned the loan yields coming in above existing, the mortgage warehouse obviously a big contributor to the loan growth this year or this quarter. What are the yields there? And then equipment finance, the new money yields there, and is that the VAR stuff that's being accretive to the yield? Sure. A couple things. The first I would say and I think we said this on the last quarter, the differential between new business yield last quarter and the portfolio yield was about 50 basis points. That did contract this quarter. This quarter it was about 30 basis points. They still positive and nicely positive but not quite as positive. Had to do with the drop in one month LIBOR which was about 25, 26 basis points linked quarter. The mortgage warehouse spread came in a bit in the quarter but are a little north of 2%, 200 basis points. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Your next question comes from Dave Bishop with D.A. Davidson. Hey, Dave. Hey. Good evening, gentlemen. Hey, how are you doing? Hey, heading back to deposits, one of your competitors at their conference call this morning I know  called out (00:38:28) about an 8 point differential between peak deposit cost and current term rates you're out there paying. Just curious if you have like a similar number where you've seen the overall cost of deposits I guess peak to currently? I'm not sure we heard everything you said. You were asking about our current existing deposit cost relative to new business that's going on? New business and maybe how it compares to where you are at, I guess, the peak maybe the summer and how far you've sort of come off the peak of average deposit costs? Well as you saw, average deposit costs came down 4 basis points in the quarter. The way we really think about it is where we're trying to specifically raise deposits either in retail CDs or in money markets and kind of what those specials are so to speak. And what I said in my comments is prior to the end of the second quarter, we lowered promotional CD rates twice. And then in the third quarter, we lowered money markets twice. For example, today we have a – we're raising six-month CDs at about a 180 across our franchise, we would be expecting that to come down as right now we have a little over 80% chance of what the market's pricing in for the Fed move at the end of the month. So we will be bringing our CD special rates down and then also our money market promos down as we get a little closer to that date. But if I think about those rates today relative to deposit cost, that relationship is not fundamentally different than where it was three months ago. Got it. And I think in the preamble, you noted that within the other operating expense category, there was a number of, I guess, quasi, unusual one-time type items. Just curious in totality how much flowed through the other expense category this quarter? Yeah, it was $8 million. And that seems more as unusual one-time type, I think you mentioned some legal type expenses... (00:41:05) Yeah. Definitely one-time, not in the run rate. Okay. And in terms of the effective tax rate, look like that was a little bit lower than the first couple quarters here, anything unusual there or maybe some guides into the final quarter of the year and in 2020? No, that was just in the quarter we filed our 2018 taxes and we have a fairly large low income housing tax portfolio and favorable impact on the tax rate. So a little bit of catch up once all the K-1s came in from those investments. You haven't followed us for too many years but it's a normal third or fourth quarter event for us. Got it. Got it. And then just one final question, just looking through the slide deck, clearly capital levels remain well above the well-capitalized rate. But total risk based capital. Is that sort of the governor here in terms of the growth profile there? Just curious in terms of where you see the, I guess, the narrowest margin above the well-capitalized range and how you think about that? Yeah. We're a company that usually the capital constraint for us is total risk based capital just because of the large commercial lending book that we have. Always easily addressed when that time is right with sub-debt issuance but at 12% it's on the low end historically, but we're very comfortable with it sitting there today with the risk in our business mix. Great. thank you. Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Thanks. Good evening, guys. Good evening, Collyn. Most of my questions have been asked and I think Casey hit on a handful of them. But just back to the loan yield, and again I think just trying to reconcile your comments, David, about 25 basis point cut in rates would imply a 2 to 3 basis point compression in NIM, you didn't see it this quarter, obviously it fared better. So just dissecting that a little bit more, the mix here is relevant. And then also on what you did on the deposit side because I think you'd guided to where you'd indicated last quarter that you were thinking maybe deposit costs would still tick up this quarter but then drop in the fourth quarter. So just trying to piece this all together. So if we – on the loan yield side, so you mentioned what the warehouse loan yields were 200 basis points over. Just curious what the yields were – new origination yields were on the equipment finance and then just more of your traditional C&I loans? A couple things there, Collyn. Hopefully, I get them all. It's not two basis points to three basis points, I thought I said three basis points to four basis points. I would also – I probably should've mentioned – I would say because of the lateness of the second move by the Fed, there's probably a little bit of repricing left from that move in our home equity portfolio. That's the cycle for a full month to have all those prime based loans reprice. I don't have a number for you on that but it's a small number but it's out there. And actually I don't remember us saying that we thought deposit costs would tick up in the third quarter. I'm pretty sure we said the opposite or we were silent to that. And then lastly just across the – we have three different equipment platforms that are all – that are quite different in nature as you know with the lowest yielding doing the larger transactions, our original PCLC. Coupons in that business run from about 4% to 4.25%. Our highest yielding is the old Financial Federal, People's United Equipment Finance where we can run yields from 6.5% to 7% on average across that business. And then we, as we've talked about many times before, can run 7%, 7.5% type range on that portfolio. Okay. So are you not seeing much compression then on new origination yields within that segment? It just doesn't seem like there's a lot of variation, I don't think from what you have indicated in the past. Well, I would say there is pricing pressure and it's mostly in the largest one, PCLC. But I would say across those three businesses, the managers fight that every day and do an exceptionally good job. We talked many times about how diversified all of our lending businesses are. We are seeing pressure in our large corporate. We've talked about mortgage warehouse, PCLC. Commercial real estate is relatively steady. LEAF has been steady, and somewhat – we've actually in the quarter had some businesses where we are able to widen spreads. Okay. Okay, that's great. And then just shifting to loan growth. So, I'm pretty sure although maybe my notes are wrong again, but on the loan growth guide, I thought you guys were thinking before UBNK, you were at 10% to 12% for the year. Is that correct? Is that what your prior guidance... (00:47:16) ...yes, correct. Okay. Okay. So you're there more or less year to date. So just trying to think about – and, Jack, I appreciate your comments kind of broadly and how you're seeing your customer behavior and such. But just curious – and mortgage warehouse obviously was elevated this quarter maybe some flow through in the fourth quarter. But just sort of how you sort of see some of the pipelines trending as you go into the fourth quarter as it relates to loan growth? Hi, Collyn. This is Jeff Tengel. Hi, Jeff. We see the fourth quarter, the pipelines are still – I would characterize them as being in good shape, pretty consistent with where we saw them coming into the third quarter. There's obviously some variables there. The mortgage warehouse lending business being a big one, some of that's offset by the fourth quarter historically being a pretty strong quarter for our equipment finance businesses. So we still feel pretty good about the health of the pipelines going into the fourth quarter. We saw an elevated level of payoffs in the third quarter in a number of our businesses which, if that does not occur in the fourth quarter, would be a benefit. A lot of M&A activity, a lot of capital markets activity that impacted some of our businesses that we're hopeful won't occur in the fourth quarter. Okay. Okay. That's super helpful. That was all I had. Thanks, guys. Thank you. You're welcome. Your next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Thanks. Good afternoon. Hi, there. Hey. Just going back to a couple of these comments that touched on CECL and the loan to deposit ratio. It would seem like the growth headwind that you referenced, could you accelerate some of that process by potentially selling down some of the resi exposure dilutive to your asset yield, somewhat pejorative under CECL as you mentioned, you'd create some more shelf space with your LD ratio? And why not – why not do that? We could. Last quarter, we were asked about could we do that in New York multifamily, and we said yes, we could and both are profitable portfolios. So we think and talk about it, our ADCO discusses strategies like that from time to time, but we usually get back to, we're comfortable with the credit risk, we have the capital to support it, they're making money for us, and it gives us more time to remix the balance sheet. We don't feel we need to accelerate the remix of the balance sheet because we don't. Of all those things I mentioned, none of them are overly concerning to us. Got it. Okay. And separately on the funding side, is there anything you'd call out in terms of the cadence of CD or FHLB repricing in the fourth quarter that would or first quarter next year, that would allow you to step down those rates more quickly? Well, I guess I'd say two things. One is, the wholesale borrowings that we do in the markets are from the home loan, step down – those costs stepped down nicely because they are much more market sensitive, so they will pretty much move with one month LIBOR. On the customer funding side, we're obviously subject to what our competitors are doing across their portfolios, retail, commercial, et cetera. The good news in that is the industry is being quite disciplined. As we talked about on this call, we were a little early in some of those moves, but we've seen more – we've seen other banks be aggressive as well, which is a great thing. And there is a lot of turn in the CD book. So if you think about into the future quarters if rates drop and the market lowers rates, we'll be able to benefit from that as CDs mature and reprice. Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks. Thank you. In closing, we're pleased with the strong third quarter performance which was highlighted by another quarter of record earnings, stable net interest margin, lower deposit costs, continued strong fee income, well-maintained expenses and sustained excellent asset quality. Thank you for your interest in People's United. Have a good night. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."

         "Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me for the call is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, our newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer. Slide 2 is our statement in forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I'm now moving to slide 3. And before I review our quarterly results, I want to comment on our leadership transition that we announced last month. In keeping with our thorough and robust succession planning process developed by our board of directors, I announced my upcoming retirement effective May 1 of next year; and Chris Gorman was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of our board of directors. Chris will succeed me as Chairman and CEO next May. And I will have opportunities to speak with you over the next several quarters, but I just want to say that my time at Key has represented some of my most rewarding years of my 40 years in banking. I'm proud of what this team has accomplished as we have transformed this company, our culture, our strategy, and our performance. And importantly, I will remain fully engaged over the next seven months and I'm committed to working with Chris for a seamless leadership transition. I look forward to Key's continued success under Chris, with our diverse and talented leadership team, and I have every confidence in our future success. Now, moving on to the results we reported this morning. My remarks will adjust for our previously reported fraud loss and notable items in prior periods. So, let me start with a few headlines. Earnings per share grew 7% from the year-ago period and 9% from the second quarter. We reached the top end of our targeted cash efficiency ratio range of 54% to 56%, with a reported 56%, which is our lowest level in over a decade. We delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage, driven by both revenue growth and a 3% sequential quarter decline in expenses. And we saw a solid balance sheet growth and strong fee income with a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees. On the revenue side, we saw good momentum across our company. We grew both loans and deposits 4% from the prior year, driven by activity in both our commercial and consumer businesses. We generated another quarter of strong broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans, and saw higher consumer loan balances, driven by Laurel Road and strength in our consumer mortgage lending. Noninterest income was up 7% from the year-ago period, benefiting from strong investment banking and debt placement fees, as well as growth in corporate services and consumer mortgage income. As I said, noninterest expense was down 3% from the year-ago period and reflects the successful execution of our cost initiatives, as well as our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. And I would remind you that our expense levels relative to the prior year include the addition of our Laurel Road acquisition earlier this year. Importantly, although we are focused on bringing expenses down, we continue to invest a portion of our cost savings back into the business to drive future growth. And we continue to manage the company with a long-term perspective by taking actions to position us to perform through the business cycle. This includes maintaining our disciplined credit writing – underwriting and our risk profile. We also continue to manage capital, consistent with our stated capital priorities, including returning a significant portion of our earnings back to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $0.185 per share and continue to repurchase shares. Before I turn the call over to Don, let me just say that this was a good quarter for Key and clearly demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our business model. We saw top line growth in loans, deposits, and fees; and paired this with strong expense control. This drove our cash efficiency ratio to 56%, hitting our targeted range this quarter. Clearly, there are some headwinds with lower interest rates and the signs of a slowing economy, and although our clients have turned more cautious, we continue to see good engagement and solid pipelines. Our business model and interest rates hedging also positions us well as we move through the different business cycles and rate environments. And expense management also remains a priority as we continue to identify opportunities to further improve efficiency. We remain committed to reaching our long-term targets, maintaining our moderate risk profile, and ultimately delivering results for our shareholders. With that, I will close and turn the call over to Don. Thanks, Beth. I'm now on slide 5. This morning we reported third quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.38 per common share. Adjusting for our previously disclosed fraud loss, earnings per share was $0.48. Our adjusted results compare to $0.45 per share in the year-ago period and $0.44 in the second quarter of 2019. As reported in July, we became aware of fraudulent activity conducted by a longstanding business customer. Due to the ongoing investigation and litigation, we're limited in the information we can share. The fraud loss was recognized in our provision for credit losses this quarter with a pre-tax impact of $123 million. The after-tax impact was $94 million. The fraud was realized as an overdraft to various operating accounts and charged off, resulting in a recognition through our provision for credit losses. We're continuing to pursue all avenues of recovery and we will provide any material updates in our public filings. I would also point out the impact of interest rates on our return on tangible common equity. Over the last four quarters, our other comprehensive income component of our capital has increased by $1.2 billion primarily due to lower rates. This increase had a 170-basis-point negative impact on our ROTCE compared to the third quarter of 2018. Said otherwise, if the OCI remain the same, our ROTCE and notable items would have been 17.1% in the third quarter of this year. I'll cover many of the other items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to slide 6. Our business model continues to position us well to grow relationships and loan balances. Total average loans were $92 billion, up 4% from the third quarter of last year, driven primarily by the growth in commercial and industrial loans, which were up 8%. linked-quarter growth and average balances was also driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans, up 2%. Our growth continues to be broad-based across our footprint, as well as through our targeted industry verticals. C&I growth was partially offset by decline in commercial real estate balances due to the elevated paydowns and our more cautious stance on certain loan types and markets. Importantly, our growth continues to be more balanced, with continued growth in consumer loans. We have made meaningful investments in our consumer mortgage business and completed the Laurel Road acquisition earlier this year, and both are delivering results. For Laurel Road, we originated over $500 million of loans this quarter. In our consumer mortgage business, we originated $1.3 billion of loans in the third quarter, more than double our volume from a year ago and up 20% from last quarter. Of this production, approximately 60% was retained on balance sheet. Importantly, we remain disciplined with our credit underwriting and we've walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective. Continuing on to slide 7. Average deposits totaled $110 billion for the third quarter 2019, up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the year-ago period, and up 1% from the prior quarter. Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. On a linked-quarter basis, the increase in deposit balances was also driven by both consumer and commercial clients, as well as elevated levels of short-term deposits from certain commercial customers. Total interest-bearing deposit costs were down 1 basis point from the prior quarter, reflecting the lag in deposit pricing. We saw the impact of lower rates coming through late in the quarter, in next quarter we would expect to see more of this benefit come through. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 66% of our total deposit mix. Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $980 million for the third quarter 2019 compared to $993 million in the third quarter 2018 and $989 million in the second quarter of this year. Our net interest margin was 3% for the third quarter 2019 compared to 3.18% for the third quarter 2018 and 3.06% for the second quarter. The decrease in net interest income from the third quarter of 2018 reflects lower interest rates, lower loan fees, as well as a decline in purchase accounting accretion. These declines were partially offset by higher earning asset balances. Net interest income decreased $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter, driven by lower interest rates and loan fees. This quarter's net interest margin came in lower than expected. Our deposit rates were higher than forecasted, reflecting a slower response to interest rates and market pressures. We did see the rates move down late in the quarter, providing benefit for the fourth quarter. Other factors that impacted our margin included lower loan fees costing 1 basis point and lower LIBOR rates relative to the change in fed funds. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to remain relatively stable. Our outlook includes average interest-bearing deposit rates declining by approximately 10 basis points relative to the third quarter. This also assumes an additional 25 basis point cut in rates in late October and continued growth in our loans. In the appendix of our slide deck, you can find additional information on our asset liability positioning. We've continued to actively hedge to reduce our exposure to declining rates, executing approximately $2.4 billion in interest rate floors in the third quarter. Our repositioning to reduce our risk to declining rates began in the third quarter of last year; and since that time, we've entered into a total of swaps and floors of $17 billion. Moving to slide 9. Key's noninterest income was $650 million for the third quarter 2019 compared to $609 million for the year-ago quarter. The change from the year-ago period reflects growth across most fee categories. We reached a record third quarter in investment banking and debt placement fees, up $10 million from last year. We also saw strong corporate services income, primarily driven by higher fees from derivatives. And we also saw year-over-year growth in both consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest income increased by $28 million, driven by many of the same categories. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $13 million from last quarter, and we also saw growth in corporate services and consumer mortgage income. Now, turning to slide 10, expense management continues to be a very positive story, as we've delivered on our expense and efficiency commitments. We completed our $200 million cost savings initiative at the end of the second quarter and the results are fully in our third quarter run rate. We have also continued to reinforce our culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization. Third quarter noninterest expense was $939 million. This compares to $964 million in the third quarter 2018 and $967 million in the prior quarter, excluding notable items in the second quarter. The table on the bottom left side of the slide breaks out the notable items. Noninterest expense decreased $25 million or 3% compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year comparison reflects the successful implementation of Key's expense initiatives and the elimination of the FDIC surcharge. These expenses were partially offset by the addition of Laurel Road earlier this year. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense declined $28 million, excluding notable items in the prior period. The decline reflects the successful implementation of Key's expense initiatives across the franchise, which drove lower personnel expense and positively impacted a number of other line items. Moving on to slide 11, as I said previously, our provision and net charge-offs included $123 million from our previously disclosed fraud loss. Excluding the fraud loss, net charge-offs were $73 million or 31 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our over-the-cycle range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. On a similar basis, again, excluding fraud loss, the provision for credit losses was $77 million for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our net charge-offs, reflecting continued loan growth. Nonperforming loans were $585 million this quarter, up $24 million from the prior quarter, but down $60 million from a year-ago period. Nonperforming loans represented 63 basis points of period-end loans compared to 61 basis points last quarter. Nonperforming assets this quarter had a temporary increase with the transfer of several loans that held for sale. We believe these credits are properly marked and we are moving through the sales process, which should be completed soon. Criticized loans and our 90-day past due loans both declined this quarter. Overall, credit quality remains strong. Our new loan originations in both the commercial and consumer book continue to be high-quality relationship business. Turning on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain relatively stable this quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.52% at the end of the third quarter. As Beth mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our capital priorities, including returning a significant amount to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we declared a common share dividend of $0.185 a share, up 9% from the quarterly stock dividend. We also continue to repurchase common shares, with $248 million repurchased this quarter. Turning to slide 13. Similar to our approach a year ago, we have provided fourth quarter guidance relative to our third quarter results. And our guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide. Average loans should be up in the low-single-digit range, driven by C&I and continued growth in the consumer balances from Laurel Road and our consumer mortgage business. Average deposits should be relatively stable. Net interest income should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter. This assumes a 25-basis-point interest rate cut late in October and a solid balance sheet growth and decreased deposit rates, which will help provide more stability in net interest income. Noninterest income should be up in the low single digits, reflecting solid investment banking pipelines, as well as growth in our other fee businesses, along with some seasonality in areas such as COLI. We would expect noninterest expenses to be also up in the low-single-digit range as a result of the seasonal factors, including incentive compensation tied to our Capital Markets business. Similar to past years, we would also expect to have a pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter to approximate the amount taken in the same period last year. On credit quality, we see nothing on the horizon that changes our outlook. Net charge-offs, including the fraud loss, should remain stable and we expect that our loan loss provision will be – will slightly exceed net charge-offs, reflecting continued loan growth. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate would be approximately 16%. Overall, we expect a good finish to the year despite some headwinds from rates and signs of potentially slower economic growth. Our clients have become more cautious, but we continue to see good engagement and expect to grow through offering our targeted clients attractive on- and off-balance sheet alternatives. Over time, we have reduced our net interest – interest rate sensitivity and we remain diligent in our underwriting and risk management. And we will continue to manage expenses through our continuous improvement efforts, while investing a portion of the savings back into the business. Finally, we expect to achieve our long-term targets, and I believe over time our market valuation will reflect our progress and improve results. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. John? Thank you.  First in line we have Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Hey. I guess, first of all, congratulations on the succession to both of you guys. So, maybe top – first question is on the tax rate. I think it came in a little lower than I expected this quarter. It looks like the guide is perhaps for slightly lower one next quarter as well. Can you maybe talk to the nuance of that and if that's the kind of thing that would sort of sustain itself into 2020 as well? Yeah. As far as the third quarter, what you're seeing in the reported tax rate is the impact of the fraud loss. And so, that really is reported on an incremental basis. So, if you would adjust for that, our effective tax rate was a little north of 16%. We would expect the same type of range for the fourth quarter, which reflects the benefit of credits that are available to us and also the impact of the updated outlook for pre-tax earnings as well. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, just, I guess, at a top level, now that you've hit the top end of the efficiency range, do we think that that's a number that you guys will be able to sustain into coming periods or improve upon, or how were you thinking that – about that dynamic as you look into the next several quarters? Yeah. Long-term, we clearly want to operate within that range, and we think that's appropriate given our business mix that we have here at Key, and it's something that we feel is an indication of us being able to manage our overall cost structure efficiently and effectively. As far as next year, we're still expecting to manage for the full-year in that range. Now, you could see quarters where like the first quarter of each year tends to be a little bit higher than through the rest of the year, but that would be our objective as well going forward. Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. Next in the line we have Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. If I heard correctly, I think you said 10 basis points of interest-bearing deposit cost reductions in the fourth quarter including the October cut. I guess, presumably, let's call that a 20% deposit beta given the 50-basis-point reduction. Can you just talk about, like, your ability to reduce deposit costs? Just in terms of competition, we hear it's very slow of other banks bringing down their deposit costs. I'm just kind of wondering at what point does that actually start to accelerate. Thanks. Yeah. Sure. That – we would probably define it as stronger than a 20% beta, because that rate decline doesn't occur till late in October. And so, the average throughout the quarter would suggest something probably in the 30% beta. Longer-term, we would hope to see that in the 40% to 45% range as far as reaction to rates. You're absolutely right, we are seeing competitive pressures, especially on the consumer side that is resulting in some of those deposit rates being a little stickier than what we would've expected initially. We still think there's plenty of opportunity for us to manage that down and to be in that 40% to 45% beta to allow us to have more stability in the margin prospectively. All right, great. And then, could you provide any update in terms of the impact to the CECL? Yeah. Sure. We'll provide additional disclosure in our Q. But what we have talked about is that, for commercial loans, we really don't see an increase from the incurred loss method to CECL. And on the economic outlook, you could actually see a slight decline in commercial. Now, offsetting that on the consumer side that we would expect the CECL reserve to probably about three times the level that we're seeing on the incurred loss method. And that really reflects more of a life of loan type of loss expectation as opposed to, today you probably have about a year-and-a-half or so of charge-offs included in the consumer categories. And so, luckily for us, our reserves are only about 15% consumer and about 85% commercial. So, the relative impact to us should be fairly modest compared to some of the early indications we've seen from some of the other companies. All right, great. Thank you. Next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Morning. Just want to get some additional color there of what you're seeing in terms of loan demand. I know that you've indicated that the pipelines are solid, but obviously we've seen a little bit of a pullback in ISM and a little bit of pullback in CapEx activity. So, I just want to see if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the commercial side. And then, what does that mean in terms of how you're thinking about broader loan growth when you look at 2020, could it be near the 4% that you're looking at for 2019? Thanks. John, it's Chris. Good morning. Our loan growth this quarter was as a result of our continued focus and strength of our commercial businesses. What is differentiated now for Key vis-à-vis the past are the new engines that we have on the consumer side; and as you heard Don talk about the growth we have in mortgage and also now that we have Laurel Road. So, those will be opportunities for us to kick-in loan growth as we go forward. We anticipate, on the commercial side, utilization being relatively flat. We have seen – as both Beth and Don mentioned, our customers are cautious. But having said that, we're still out there talking to our customers, serving our customers, the pipelines remain strong. But I think clearly there are some challenges out there. Okay. Thanks. All right. That's helpful. On the – separately on the credit side, just wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the nonperformers. I know that NPLs were up a bit for the quarter despite the higher charge-offs even when you exclude the fraud. So, I just wanted to get a little bit of color on what drove the inflows into nonaccruals in the quarter, and also if you have any detail on how criticized assets trended for the quarter? Thanks. Sure. As far as the change in the NPLs and the inflows, we did have three commercial credits that moved into nonperforming status this quarter. They were criticized loans before and the status was changed from accruing to nonaccruing. And those three loans totaled $100 million. And so, that was – isolated those individual credits, as we've said before, you can have episodic type of issues or things that pop up that we believe are temporary. In connection with our nonperforming loans, we also, as we mentioned, transferred a pool of assets, which included some commercial and some residential real estate to held-for-sale, which on the process of sale we expect those to close quickly and bring that level down. As far as the charge-offs, they came in at 31 basis point this quarter, I think they were 28 basis points or 29 basis points last quarter. I think you will see some variability in that range. But I think – and that low-30-basis-point range is probably a good outlook going forward and reflects a very stable and a very strong credit quality overall. As far as criticized and classified, I'd say they're relatively stable and maybe even down a little bit linked-quarter. But very, very stable as far as the overall credit quality from that perspective. Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate the color. And next we'll go to Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Good morning. Good morning. You guys had very nice momentum on the expenses particularly driven, I guess, by the reduction in head count. I'm just wondering, do you think you can drive expenses lower further in 2020? Yeah. We're always going to have a continuous improvement mindset. And what we would typically target would be to keep expenses relatively stable, and allow us with that to make investments back in the business to grow the top line. We're very focused on driving positive operating leverage and we continue to expect to deliver that this year and we'll expect to do that again next year as well. And so, these continuous improvement opportunities allow us to manage our expenses more efficiently, more effectively, and includes ongoing efforts like workflow redesign, branch consolidations and other things like that that we just think are part of our ongoing business model, and it's going to be critical for us to continue those efforts to make sure that we have the capacity to reinvest back in the business. Actually a follow-up on Scott's question about the tax rate. Looking to 2020, would it go back to that more normal range of 18% to 19%? Well, we'll provide more guidance in January as far as the tax rate outlook. I think that there's a number of factors that influence that. One is, is the level of credits that are available to us that we continue to be a active participant, some of the alternative energy sources, which allows us to realize some tax credits associated with that. And so, part of our outlook will be determined based on what we see as the market for those credits, but also the impact of the overall pre-tax earnings going forward. And so, we'll provide more outlook there. But I'd say that you'll probably see some increase compared to the current year because of some of the noise that are in the – this year's numbers. Thanks very much. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Hey, Don. Just a follow-up on that hope that you can still get inside the 54%, 56% for next year on the cash efficiency ratio. Obviously, we're seeing the head count reductions, you just talked about some of the other efficiency improvements, but the Street's obviously still modeling way above that. Perhaps you can help us address just where you see the delta. Is it just that we're not anticipating as much of a reduction in the overall cost base as perhaps you guys are seeing? Any color just in terms of maybe how that cadence of expenses might go would be helpful. Thank you. Sure. And I think you've already hit on one of the surprises, I think that our expenses did come in lower than what the Street was expecting for us this quarter and it really serves as a foundation for us going forward. And so, we would expect to, as I said, be in a position so we can continue to manage that expense level to be relatively stable and continue to grow revenues. And so, that's the critical part for us. And I think as we do that, we should be able to continue to manage that efficiency ratio into the range for us over time here. Okay. Got it. And then, secondly, just, can you talk about the balance sheet protections? And slide 17 is very helpful again. Just the cadence of how the forward starting swaps are going to move on, and any color that you can provide in terms of where the new floors and existing floors are going to – or the strike prices are? Thanks, Don. Sure. We did add $2.4 billion of primarily floors this past quarter. And so, as you highlighted that we've seen a lot of investments made there since the third quarter of last year. We've got about $3 billion worth of floors starting swaps that most of which will kick in here for us in the fourth quarter. And just to put that in perspective, we're going to have a received fixed rate of – in the upper 2%, 2.90% range as opposed to, today it would be a much lower resulting – starting point for that received fixed rate. As far as the floors, it really provides this protection within a plus or minus 100-basis-point range as far as the current flows. And so, we did see some benefit in the third quarter from those floors and it's more provided as far as a additional protection for us in case rates do go down further than what we would expect. And so, we're using that more as a protection as opposed to a revenue source for us. And one final one, just, are you done with the program adds, like, this is where you want to be in terms of that swaps and floors mass that you now have ready to start? We would like to continue to increase our derivatives to offset some of the interest rate risk that we still have in the portfolio. So, I think that when we've talked about $2.4 billion of new floors this quarter, we would expect to see that kind of similar pace going forward, with a combination of floors and swaps. And the determination as to whether we would do the swaps or floors will be based on how does the forward curve compare with our internal assessment as to where rates are going. And so, we think it's important to continue to position us to be even more interest rate neutral and we'll continue down that path. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Don. Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, everybody. Morning. I wanted to start, first to follow up on the comments, Don, that you could hold expenses flat in 2020. What are your expectations for the head count? You think on an overall basis you can still manage that lower next year? I would say that our efforts continue to be focused on a culture around continuous improvement. And so, we believe that there're ongoing opportunities for us to right-size some of the workflows we have throughout the organization. And as we've talked before in the past, we would expect to continue to see our branch count come down, and we said it's 2% to 3%. And each one of those could have some impact on staffing, but the staffing numbers themselves aren't as critical to us as the efficiencies we gain. And we think there's other ways that we can leverage third-party vendors and leverage some of the technology spend that we make that will help drive some of those efficiencies that won't be as FTE-dependent as was – what we've experienced over the last year Okay. That's helpful. And then, when we look at the fourth quarter, it's typically your strongest quarter for IB and debt placement fees. If I look at loans held for sale, they came down a bit. I know it's typically our leading indicator. Does that imply maybe a bit softer quarter for debt placement fees? I don't know what the pipeline looks for 4Q. So, Steve, it's Chris. Our fourth quarter pipeline is, I would characterize as strong. So, sometimes there is a correlation as you look at what's held for sale and what's not. That depends a lot on mix. As we look at our pipeline, I would characterize our pipeline as strong going into the fourth quarter, from investment banking and debt placement fees. Okay. Got you. And then, if I could sneak one more in. Don, just looking at the appendix in the slide where you're calling out that you're basically effectively neutral to rates now, does this imply even beyond 4Q, the NIM should be relatively flat? Is that basically the assumption? That's our expectation at this point in time. I'd say that what the slide would basically say is, we're neutral to the forward curve. And so, if there's variances to that forward curve, it could have an impact on near-term rates. But that's our whole objective as far as managing to more of an interest rate neutral position as to have as much stability as we can in that net interest margin and help drive the revenue growth from there. Okay. Thanks, and congratulations, Beth. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Thanks, Steve. Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Gerard. Good morning. Don, you mentioned about the deposit rates didn't start to move down until the end of the quarter following the last rate cut. There was somewhat of a delay. Do you think on future rate cuts, there'll be the same type of delay or is this momentum that you're seeing on lower deposit costs will carry through into the next rate cut? I think there were some situations this quarter that were unique, that on the consumer front, we continue to see rates go up in July and even into August on the consumer side, and some of that was from promos that were in place and other things like that. I would say, going forward, we wouldn't expect to see the same type of delay. We were a little surprised, to be honest, though, that we thought that the markets would move down quicker than what they did, and they didn't. But as I mentioned, for example, in the promos, we've got about $2 billion each quarter of money market deposits that are at a promo rate that will roll off. And so, that will also help accelerate some of the deposit betas on the retail side that we wouldn't have available to us  in the quarter (00:34:58). Very good. And then, Chris, on Laurel Road, can you share with us – obviously, it seems to be going well, but what type of expansion you can take from what you're learning from Laurel Road into other consumer products? Sure. Well, you're right, Gerard. We've been very pleased with Laurel Road. And the first thing we want to do is sort of run the place that they had, which was really a complete digital approach to the refinancing of loans, principally for doctors and dentists. And as you saw in this quarter, we originated about $0.5 billion in loans. The next phase of that is going to be our ability to similarly provide mortgage. So, you can imagine, we have in a digital format all the information we need for sort of Phase 2, which is to provide a digital mortgage to those customers. And further, we can leverage, Gerard, that technology and that approach across all of Key. And then, lastly, what it would give us the opportunity to do at some point would be to create an infinity strategy around a targeted segment which is obviously consistent with how we go to market. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. With the transition from Beth to Chris, can you just talk about how that transition works? Beth, if you'll be staying around in any capacity once Chris takes the reigns? Why Chris was selected? And, Chris, maybe how you might think about things differently? And I know this is a little unusual, but also it's appreciated to have both of you on the call, and a smooth transition. Good morning, Mike. I'll start with – as you know, Chris has been with our company since the last 1990s. He ran our Corporate Bank and very successfully developed that strategy on our behalf to include what I'd call our distinctive corporate investment banking capabilities; was the Head of our Merger; and in the last couple years, he's been our President – Vice Chairman and President of Banking. We also have at Key what I think is a great and talented and very diverse team with good momentum. As of May 1 next year, I've been with the company 14 years and I will have been our CEO for 9 years. So, I think there is value in knowing when is an appropriate time to work on an orderly succession. And as we said in our comments, I will be our Chairman and CEO till May 1, at which time I will retire. And no, I will not have ongoing responsibilities at Key, I will fully retire. And at that time, Chris will become our Chairman and CEO. And as I've said, I'm excited and fully confident in the team, in the future under Chris's leadership. And I too have chapters to write and things to do, and I think this is an example of what a well-orchestrated and appropriate succession looks like. So, Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, it's obviously an honor and a privilege to lead what I think is just a great team. And I think we have a really, really good and defined strategy that we laid out at Investor Day last October; the whole notion of targeted scale, how a company of our size can be really effective, when we target who we want to be relevant to and how we want to be relevant. As it relates to the transition, Beth and I work very, very closely together. And I'm confident it will be an absolutely seamless transition. And as we go forward, while we have our strategy in place, the reality is, our industry is changing and changing quickly. And I think we as a team that can stay out ahead of it and position us for continued success. And then, just one follow-up, maybe looking in the past and in the future, as it relates to scale, because you mentioned scale and the scale to compete in an era where the largest banks spend a lot more in technology and marketing and they're expanding into your markets. So, just, how do you think about your competitive positioning over the next five, seven years? Beth, you've obviously held to the current strategy, made one acquisition. Will the acquisition appetite maybe increase, or what's your thought process? So, as we look forward, as I mentioned, I think, Mike, for a bank our size to try to be all things to all people is not the strategy. The strategy for us has always been to figure out who we can be relevant to and make the appropriate investments, whether it's people, processes, technologies. And if you think about the investments we've made, things like HelloWallet, which is digital wellness; things like Laurel Road; things like Bolstr, which is in the commercial side. We think with proper focus, we have all the capabilities that we need and bandwidth that we need to make the investment continue to grow the business. Thank you. Next, we'll go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Congratulations, Chris, on the new role; and Beth, on all of your accomplishments. So, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the deposits commentary. Don, you mentioned that you were surprised the market didn't go even lower. Why do you think that is? And is the diversions versus your expectation coming from the consumer side because you mentioned the promo rates and the pressure related to that, or is it also occurring on the commercial side? And if you can just talk a little bit about your expectation for a 40% to 45% beta on the way down, I would think most of that is on the commercial side versus the consumer side, but if you can comment on that? And whether you think there are risks to being aggressive on commercial deposit pricing? Does it hurt your competitive position at all with some of your commercial clients? Great. Well, I'll try to hit all those topics, and if I miss some, please help provide some more guidance. There were a few questions in there. There were more than five questions, sorry. That's great. And on the consumer front, as we were going through rates moving up, consumer portfolio lagged and lagged significantly, and the deposit betas there were extremely low. And so, it may have been false hope or expectations on my part to see a faster reduction as far as the initial reaction on some of the consumer rates. But we do think they will come down over time and we will see the market to move down. And I think we're seeing that this quarter with a lot of the banks showing pressure as far as deposit rates and very few having deposit betas on the way down that probably would've been expected or anticipated. So, we believe that we'll see that come through. As we mentioned before, at the end of September, we were seeing some of the rates come down and seeing some of the actions put in place. It probably just occurred a little slower than what we would have expected. On the commercial side, the commercial deposits, as a general, have more deposits that are indexed to the changes in interest rates. For us, that tends to be more indexed to fed funds as opposed to LIBOR. And this quarter, LIBOR impacted the loans and it was a much bigger decline than what the fed funds rate declines occurred and, therefore, impacted our cost of funds. And so, as those things stabilize, we should see even further reductions on the commercial side. One of the things we try to manage all is, is that, we're flushed with the liquidity right now. We've had an internal target of having an LCR ratio somewhere around 110%. This last quarter, we need up north of 145%. And so, we have a lot of excess liquidity. And we would hope to try to manage that and manage some of the rates down more in a leading position that would allow us to recapture some of that deposit beta that we missed out on here in the third quarter. Got it. Do you feel pretty good about the 10 basis points then in the fourth quarter? We feel good about the actions we're taking and feel good about achieving that in the fourth quarter. That's correct. Just as switch of gears, can you remind us how much Laurel Road contributed to the cost base? I want to say it was in the $30 million, was the run rate. But is that right? And has there been any sort of impact on revenue thus far? What we talked about as far as the acquisition was about a $20 million per quarter run rate as far as expenses. And the current expense levels are just a little bit less than that because of some of the efficiencies we've already been able to achieve with the integration there. We haven't disclosed revenues per se, but I would say we're off to a very strong start. Third quarter, we had over $400 million of originations and – excuse me, in the second quarter, we had over $400 million, and in third quarter we had $500 million of originations. And to put that into perspective, we just talked about $1.2 billion has been our target for a full-year's worth of originations. And so, in those first two quarters, we had over $900 million, and so we're off to a very good start there. Very pleased with the credit quality of the originations. FICO scores north of 770 and a strong income and very focused on advanced degree medical profession. And so, we're very excited about that and look forward to be a strong growth engine for us. One of other pieces we talked about for Laurel Road, though, too is, is that, some of the tools and capabilities and the ability to understand how to digitally originate new business and relationships is something that we're really just now starting to lever throughout the entire Key franchise. And we think that will be a huge benefit for us that we haven't even started to realize yet at this point. Got it. And just one final one, just a clarification. The pension charge in the fourth quarter, that is not built into the guidance, that's sort of a non-core item? We characterize that as a notable item each quarter. And so, that's – it's correct. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Thanks. Wanted to ask you a little bit about credit in a backward way. You had $123 million charge-off related to this one loan. Does that represent the lumpiness in the portfolio because that took a charge-off, some 30 basis points all the way up to 80 basis points, so you go from below your range to above your range with one loan? So, is that just a reflection of the exposure you have because of the commercial focus like you were saying earlier in the loan portfolio? Marty, as far as the $123 million, it was a fraud loss. And as we noted briefly that the fraud loss came through because of the fraud resulted in a net overdraft position of several of the operating accounts from this entity. And as a result of those being considered overdrafts, the reporting requirements would say that that should be treated as a charge-off. And so, we really consider this to be a true fraud loss and not reflective of a lending relationship. There were no loans outstanding to that entity that resulted in this fraud. Got you. Thanks. And then, Beth, wanted to congratulate you. I mean, you evolved KeyCorp into, I think, a much better company over your tenure, coming out of financial crisis and now what – Chris can now take on and continue to build from here. I wanted just, not to be too personal, but when you think about your decision in a sense of retiring and not maybe just becoming Chairman and our Chairperson going through that process, how did you think, and what's kind of weighing, why now for you individually, because I think that was a question I heard a lot from investors because I kind of got caught off-guard from here? And as you think about the strategic decisioning around moving on, it's hard for a person to – in your role to do that. And to think about what's the exit strategy for the overall company long-term. So, if you could just kind of address those two issues that'd be very helpful, I think, for folks to just have a better feel for why this is happening right now. Sure, Marty. I'd be delighted to. As I said, I think there is a lot of value in thinking as much about when and how is the right time to build succession and step down from a role like CEO and Chairman, as there is and the energy you put into it when you first get the opportunity. And I believe that with nine years in chair as our CEO as of May 1, you could call it, I've been a two-term President, and I will be 65-years-old next year. And I believe that remaining our Chairman and CEO till May 1 is the appropriate thing to do. Chris and I, as he has indicated and I've said earlier, are very much working on a seamless transition and we've obviously worked together for many, many years. The team is solid, mature, well-seasoned. The company has a lot of good momentum, and this is the appropriate time for the company, the appropriate time for me, and there's always chapters to write. And I look forward to the things that I can do civically in my continued professional commitments as well as having a little more time for family, friends and travel. And after May 1, again, from a thorough discussions with our board as we went through this succession process planning, believe the appropriate thing to do is that Chris will become our Chairman and CEO and that was done with much consideration with our board about what is the right leadership structure for Key. And yes, I will fully retire as of May 1. Well, best of luck and congratulations on the job well done. Well, Marty, I appreciate that. As I had said in my opening remarks, this has been the absolute privilege of my career. And I appreciate your comments that I think the ultimate test is you leave it better than perhaps you found it. Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Morning. Maybe just on CECL, I hear you that the overall impact day one is not that huge. But just this – the 3x on consumer and if you're growing consumer into next year like $1 billion a quarter, do we have to start thinking about like even though the cash flows haven't changed and the underlying performance hasn't changed, just building in like a $20 million reserve for growth type place holder, just from the concept of running with a much higher reserve to loan on your consumers and every time you put a loan on the books, you got to fully upfront that reserve built day one? You're absolutely right, as far as going forward, the new volume coming on the books will clearly have a higher reserve than we did historically under the over – the incurred loss method. We'll provide more clarity on that as we get into the first quarter outlook at the end of our fourth quarter call. I don't know I'd pigeonhole a $20 million placeholder yet, but that will provide some more color. But you're absolutely right, the initial provision required for a new loan origination is higher under CECL for consumers than it is under the incurred loss method. Got it. And then, just on the efficiency, I mean, I almost hate to ask this, but as long as I've been doing this, I continually screw up cash versus GAAP efficiency. Is the – so it was 160 basis point difference this quarter, is that like a stable relationship? And so, for those of us who put a GAAP efficiency in our model, the 54% to 56% plus 160 bps is a good benchmark for what you're thinking on a GAAP basis. Well, essentially the difference between the cash efficiency and the GAAP is the impact of intangible amortization. And so, going forward, the intangible amortization should continue to decline, and so that gap should narrow. Got it. So, maybe more like 100 basis points to 150 basis points next year? Yes. Perfect. Well, thank you, all, and congratulations both Beth and Chris. Thanks, Brian. Next, we'll go to Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Morning. And again, I guess, congratulations to everyone; and Beth, best of luck to you in your future endeavors. Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to. All right. And just a real quick follow-up for you, Don. I know you talked about a lot of the active hedging you guys have put in place and you got some more forward starting swaps kicking in here later this quarter and into the first quarter. So, is the expectation that the NIM could still compress here in the fourth quarter before being stable, I guess, into 2020, or do you think there's more stability here into the fourth quarter from the hedging that you guys have put into place? We will see a clear benefit from the hedging occur in the fourth quarter. Our outlook is for a stable net interest margin, and so we would expect that to occur that – I think that a good portion of that is from the deposit repricing and the benefit of the hedging, but we'll also see a little bit of benefit in that. Our look says that we'll have low-single-digit growth in loans and relatively stable deposits. And so, we should see that liquidity level in the fourth quarter come down just a little bit, which will also provide some reinforcement there as well. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Don, I just wanted to ask on the fees for the third quarter, you had the $15 million in securities gains which is a little unusual for KeyCorp. Is that something – like, are you going to have additional securities gains going forward, or as we think about – and, I guess, the genesis of the question is, as we think about the fourth quarter guide, that's off the reported $650 million base, right? So, maybe you could talk a little bit more about sort of the puts and takes on fee momentum into the fourth quarter. It sounds like the investment banking pipeline is solid, which should be helpful, of course, but maybe some of the other things that would drive growth off that base as well? Scott, we didn't have any security gains during the quarter. We did have a gain from the sale of some – an investment in a partnership we participated in, but I'm – I apologize, I don't know where you're picking up the $15 million in security gains with all that. I'm sorry. It's just in the footnote on the page 17. Okay. Three and nine months totaled $15 million. We can talk about that offline. Good. We'll go through that, I apologize. But that probably includes the gain there along with the gain on the securitization transaction we had from the sale of some of the Laurel Road loans, but we'll follow up with you on that as well. Okay, Perfect. Okay. So, either way, though, the guide is indeed off that $650 million base, right? I would say that the $650 million is core and our guidance would be based or included to that, or from the reference from the $650 million, so we expect to see growth from there going forward. Okay, great. Okay. Thank you. That sounds... And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to the company for any closing comments. Again, we thank you for participating in our call today. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. That concludes our remarks and thank you again for your time this morning, Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the TriState Capital Holdings Conference Call to Discuss Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded.

Representing TriState Capital today is Jim Getz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. He will be joined by David Demas, Chief Financial Officer for the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Getz. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are delighted to share our latest quarterly results with you this morning, not only because of the milestones achieved and record setting metrics delivered, but more importantly because we believe TriState Capital's performance is indicative of the company's commitment to execution, long-term growth potential, and the confidence we have in 2020 and beyond. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the robust earnings power of the company we'd built, when it's designed to deliver growth and value in a variety of economic and rate environments. Continued organic loan growth propelled us over our $7 billion asset target, which you may recall was one of the financial performance goals we set for 2019. Total loans surpassed the $6 billion threshold for the first time, up 26% from one year prior. Loan growth was fully funded by 28% deposit growth compared to one year ago. Total deposits also crossed the $6 billion mark, and our loan-to-deposit ratio was under 100% for the second consecutive quarter. Net interest income reached a record level for the quarter, supported by double-digit organic growth in both private banking and middle market commercial banking loans, which are up 28% and 24%, respectively, over the past 12 months. At the same time, our income statement is not solely dependent on spread income and is capable of producing strong earnings growth even in the current low LIBOR and short-term interest rate environment. Noninterest income continues to represent 30% of total revenue, with fees reaching new record levels for the quarter and first nine months of the year. We are very pleased with how our private banking, commercial banking and investment management businesses are working together to deliver strong top and bottom line results. Third quarter revenue totaled a record $47 million, up more than 11% from one year prior. Through the first nine months of the year, total revenue grew to a record $133 million, up more than 10% from the prior year. We continue to invest in our business with operating expenses in line with our stated single-digit annual growth rate goal for full-year 2019. At the same time, the scalability of the business is evident in the bank's improving efficiency ratio, which is also in line with our low 50s goal for this year. Revenues pushed pre-tax income to new record highs for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year, on pace with our 15% to 25% pre-tax income growth target for full-year 2019. Our strong top line results flowed through the bottom line. Earnings per share of $0.50 grew more than 6% from the $0.47 the company reported in the linked second quarter. That's an annualized 25% increase in earnings. The financial performance is the result of three businesses working in concert to drive differentiated and profitable growth, illustrating the flexibility and resilience of our unique model. Our private banking business delivered one of its best all-around quarters today as we fortify TriState Capital Bank's position as the nation's premier provider of marketable securities-backed loans through financial advisors. Through private banking, we provide products, experience and solutions to high-net-worth individuals, Trusts and businesses nationwide, access through a network of financial intermediary firms which we have spent years cultivating, and now number some 207. Year-to-date, we have closed new private banking loans with over 1,000 individual advisors, who we had not worked with before 2019. Private banking loan balances totaled nearly $3.4 billion at quarter-end, representing 56% of total loans, and reflecting growth of 28% during the past 12 months. And the number of third quarter private banking loan applications we received increased over 26% for the same period in 2018. About half of these applications are coming through our digital loan platform, and this continues to increase every quarter. We've built this digital lending platform for the investment advisors, Trust officers and other intermediaries we work with to help them more effectively and easily serve the high-net-worth clients we expect to attract even more applications through this platform in future periods. Our middle market commercial banking business continues to have exceptional growth with total commercial loan balances at period-end growing to $2.7 billion, an increase of 24% from September 30, 2018. Commercial and industrial loans grew by nearly 29% during the past 12 months approaching $1 billion. C&I originations remained strong totaling approximately $104 million in the third quarter. Our C&I growth reflects the addition of high quality relationship managers to our team and enhancements to our capabilities including more agile products like equipment finance. Commercial real estate loans totaled $1.7 billion growing 22% from one year prior and comprising about 28% of total loans. CRE loan origination activity remains strong as well, totaling $121 million in the third quarter. Credit quality metrics remain pristine and in fact, improved even further during the third quarter. Strong asset quality has become a hallmark of our performance and reflects the high touch nature of the relationship we've developed with our clients as well as the disciplined underwriting standards of – our team employs. Pipelines for our middle market commercial lending business continue to be robust and we expect continued strong loan growth in the fourth quarter. Loan growth remains fully funded by our deposit franchise including our sophisticated liquidity and treasury management offering. We now have more than 500 treasury management clients including deposit only and payments processing relationships with an essential need for TriState Capital's offering. Treasury management deposit account balances surpassed $1 billion threshold during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've grown treasury management deposits by approximately $450 million and look forward to achieving our goals of adding $500 million in treasury management deposits during 2019. We continue to maintain flexibility in pricing deposits. Less than 30% of our deposits are of a term nature with a seven-month duration. Just over half are a bit institutional nature and reprice with the Federal Reserve rates or other indices. The remainder approximately 20% are at our discretion. Our total cost of funds for all deposits and interest-bearing liabilities improved during the third quarter, averaging 2.27%. We are very pleased with our ability to lower our cost of funds by a full 15 basis points compared to 2.42% in the linked second quarter as we continue to focus on gathering lower-cost deposits. As you may have noted our third quarter news release, fees from interest rate swaps exceeded $4 million during the third quarter. We believe borrower's swap fee income will remain healthy in the $2.5 million to $3.5 million range for the fourth quarter. While borrower swap activity is largely driven by the rate environment, our relationship managers work methodically to maximize this fee income opportunity. A prime example is our success in building demand beyond our traditional commercial real estate borrowers where there are large and growing private banking client base. In the third quarter alone, more than 20% of our swap fees were generated from private banking relationships. A majority of our noninterest income is generated by Chartwell Investment Partners subsidiary, which grew assets under management by 1.4% to $9.6 billion during the third quarter. Investment management fees for the third quarter totaled $8.9 million, down approximately 9% year-over-year. While we no longer expect to achieve our full-year 2019 organic growth goal for Chartwell revenues, we believe our unique products, strong investment performance, and outstanding distribution capabilities continue to gather positive momentum. Chartwell's active investment strategies continue to deliver superior performance through the end of the third quarter. 71% of its products outperformed their respective benchmarks for the year-to-date period. 57% of its products were ahead for one year performance. 85% were ahead for three-year performance, and 75% were ahead for five-year performance. This level of performance has been key to our ability to attract new business through the third quarter of 2019. Chartwell has attracted about $200 million of institutional new business. This compares to $169 million of institutional new business during all of 2018. Overall, we are seeing a better environment on the institutional side of the business and one in which we are in a strong position to take advantage of, in part because of the refinements we've made to distribution and the experienced team we have assembled. Today, Chartwell's institutional new business pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. We believe investors are increasingly searching for proven, actively-managed products to generate returns in this low rate environment. And Chartwell's track record and strategies that are difficult to replicate passively are capturing their attention. Products like our short duration BB-Rated high yield and our midcap value strategy shine through here. And we believe we have good opportunities within this search activity. At September 30, we had more than $80 million of institutional commitments that are anticipated to fund in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we have considerably more new business in the pipeline that we're actively pursuing today and we aim to win more than our fair share in the months ahead. We're also getting on the retail side of our investment management business, expanding our relationships with financial and registered investment advisors, who are increasingly attracted to the unique and high performing products we offer. We have generated approximately $351 million in gross retail sales through September 30 of 2019. As with our institutional business, our retail pipeline is strong as it has ever been. As most of you know, we're actively evaluating opportunities to put our capital to work to grow investment management through a strategic acquisition that would help us take assets under management above $15 billion. Those efforts continue unabated and as always, we only pursue deals that will be immediately accretive to TriState Capital shareholders; our strong cultural fit and provide complementary products offerings. TriState Capital's leadership is invested in its success and remains focused on building long-term value for shareholders. During the first nine months of 2019, about a dozen senior executives and board members each made significant acquisitions of TriState Capital common stock, totaling in excess of $8 million. The strong earnings we reported in the third quarter and year-to-date reflect the effective execution of our engaged and invested management team. Our capital position is strong and enables us to be ready to act on an appropriate acquisition opportunity that may arise. Asset quality remains pristine and continues to differentiate us from peers and the industry. We have a diversified, sophisticated and multifaceted funding mechanism in place. In summary, we are well-positioned for continued success in the fourth quarter and then on to the future. That concludes my prepared remarks this morning. I'll now ask David Demas to join me for Q&A. Operator, please open the lines. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today comes from Russell Gunther with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, Russ. Good morning. I wanted to start on the continued C&I strength you guys have put up. It would be helpful to get a sense for what the equipment finance vertical contributed this quarter. Perhaps some color on sort of pockets of geographic strength and any other thing you'd like to add in terms of how you're able to sustain such strong growth in C&I, as well as related asset quality outlook for that loan bucket going forward. Great. Let's talk about the equipment finance first. We launched that business in January and have seen good growth there so far this year. At September 30, 2019, we had approximately $40 million in that portfolio. But typically, that business has its biggest activity in the fourth quarter, Russell, as companies think about equipment needs for the new year. So, we'd expect those balances to continue to grow nicely through the remainder of the year. On the C&I front, we see that continuing to grow pretty handily for us over the next couple years. We had laid the groundwork for this to a great extent during the recession. When other banks were looking inwardly and had to run legacy issues, we had capital and we had funding, so we laid the foundation for this, and we're beginning to reap many of the benefits by the growth that we've been experiencing. We're seeing this growth on C&I across all our regions. Some of it is particularly predominant. What we see developing like in the Philadelphia area where there's been some disruption in the banking arena there with BB&T acquiring Susquehanna and NatPenn, and we've been able to acquire talent and assets as a result of that. But I would say all four of our regions are actively participating here. We now have a group of people that for the most part have been with us on average over 10 years, so they're pretty well-established, and we expect this continue to grow pretty nicely for us. We had some capital call facilities that we've been picking up as well. And that business has been growing pretty nicely and we have about $75 million outstanding there right now, and we expect it to go up about another $25 million as we go into the new year. Great. Thanks, Jim, I appreciate that. And then just your view on the asset quality outlook within C&I, I understand the favorable dynamics and zero loss content within private banking, but it would just be helpful to get your sense and your view, perhaps normalized losses within this growing C&I book over the next couple of years. Well, I'm surprised you don't consider our current loss situation normalized. I'm assuming we're the only bank you'll speak to today that has a 0% in nonperforming loans. So it's only a... I'm certain it is. Right, it's $185 million – $184 million of nonperforming loans. We fully anticipate the quality of this portfolio to continue. As you're well aware, over the years, we've invested a considerable amount of money in a topnotch credit analytical step that we have in place today. And by considerable, I mean millions of dollars, we have about 23 of them in place now. They're career analysts, and they do very detailed scrutiny on the individual credits. They create what I would characterize as positive friction with the relationship managers in the field and they've really provided us with some strength that we value just like you do in the asset management industry with security analysts in place. And it differentiates us from many of the other banks in the sense that they look at their credit staff as an intermediary step to becoming a relationship manager and these are clearly career people. I think you've probably met Tom Groneman, our Chief Credit Officer. I consider him to be one of the best in the country. You can mention any of our commercial credits to him and he's quite articulated on every single one of them. And that's going through his staff. So we would say that I don't think our nonperforming loans are going to get any lower than the $184,000 with a $6 billion portfolio. But I expect us to be in a very good situation going into the new year that you're not going to see a lot of negative activity there. Thank you. The next question today comes from Michael Perito with KBW. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on kind of combined Chartwell capital question here. I mean you guys with the low risk balance sheet you have, obviously have some room to lever capital below kind of what we would expect to see at peer banks with more traditional portfolios. But as we look at the Chartwell performance over the last five or six quarters, I think they have struggled a little bit in the environment. I think the net growth you guys have shown have been solid, but revenues have had kind of a downward tilt and margins haven't really improved. So, I guess the question is, with how well the rest of your business is doing currently, does it make more sense to be allocating capital to the growth opportunities there, while you guys try to internally improve Chartwell's performance a little bit? Or do you think that that kind of allocating capital to Chartwell could help accelerate their improvement by adding scale over time? Okay. Let me give you a clear perspective on this. If you look at this from the standpoint of what their contribution is for the first nine months of the year, it's around 19%, okay. So, we consider that a meaningful type of contribution, if you look at it holistically. And if you look at it for this quarter, I think it's about 10% at this point, okay. But you have to ask yourself, why are you in this business? And you're in the asset management business because there's recurring fee income, and it provides this company with a lot of cash flow, okay. So, it really does strengthen the company and provide us with a much higher level of – considerably higher level of less risk profile for the company. So, we consider it an intricate part of the company. From a performance standpoint, the investment performance really couldn't get much better, okay. So you and I are talking about the financial metric contribution. When we bought this company in March of 2014, the first year – that the previous year that it had thrown off $25 million of revenue. This year, the revenue is going to be more in line with $38 million. We expect the next quarter, because of some of the opportunities we see on the sales end of it, that the flows are going to look better. It's only been in the past two quarters that we've had negative flows here. So we feel really very positive about the business. We're comfortable with the leadership team and the investment team that's in place here. You have to realize that things are not instant gratification. If you take a look back and I take you back to 2014, 2015, 2016 their contribution was in excess of 25%. Okay. 2017, 2018, and 2019 it hasn't been up to that particular level, but either has the industry that they find themselves in. The pricing that we're finding in the marketplace is quite attractive. And we clearly – I would suggest to you, if you dissect their business, you might want to look at the discipline that's put in place around expense management there to match the revenue and retain the growth outlook based on performance and distribution. So you really have to dissect this a bit and you have to understand that this is a business that has a lot of runway with regard to growth into the future. So, we feel to take it to additional critical mass is not the wrong thing to do. And the way you can find the marketplace today, it's becoming more of a seller's market – more of a buyer's market, I mean, than a seller's market who previously was a seller's market. So, we're pretty comfortable with the commitment strategically that we have made, and we're very comfortable with the 30% of noninterest income that between Chartwell and swap fees are generated here for the consolidated franchise. Got it. And then a separate question, just the comment in the prepared remarks about the swap fees, I think it was – you expect it to be about $2.5 million to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter. As we kind of think about that line item more broadly, I mean, if we are – do you guys feel that given kind of the expansion that you've done in offering that product beyond the commercial real estate customer base, that now it's a decent offset for you guys if we kind of remain in an environment where rates continue to decline and – which obviously will have some drag on your margin that that balance can remain a bit elevated in that type of environment and be a little bit more of an offset for the lower margin than you guys have had historically? Is that a fair way to think about it? The way that I would look at it, I think it's a fair way, but let me give you a fair way to look at it. This is a business that does absolutely prosper more in a declining rate environment. But when you've reached that decline and it plateaus for a while, people will continue to have an interest in this because they want to secure the rate for the future. So we would expect to have a fairly robust business here going into the new year with the commercial real estate business complemented by the private banking business, which you saw the private banking business was about 20% of the revenue there. And we're just beginning to penetrate that market at this time. And we also have opportunities there with various loans that we're putting on. Sometimes they're of some size secured by market bulls and people want to lock in a rate. So it's not unusual like – the other day, we put a loan through, and the fee was like $113,000 on it. So it's a – I wouldn't say classified as recurring fee income business like asset management is, but it's going to be pretty consistent in a declining and stable low interest rate environment. The next question today comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Good morning, Matt. Jim, I want to start on the private banking business that'd seen some impressive growth in recent years. I think you've noticed part of that growth is from very little competition. But I'm curious what your take is on the discount brokers that are now racing towards zero commissions. I think here that the private banking business that TriState does some decent-sized business with some of the discount brokers. So, it seems like their model is changing right now. And I'm curious how you believe these changes in their model could affect the competition for your private banking channel. Well, from our standpoint, I think it's a very positive situation because of the fact that maybe more people put securities with them because they can trade their securities for zero. So, it would be helpful to our cause if you want to look at it that way. To be quite candid, I'm delighted we're not in that business at all. We are for a profit organization here and that's going to be more challenging for them. But at the end, you're probably aware the way these broker dealers make a lot of their business is the free cash flow that goes through the company and the spreads they're able to make by putting it back into the market. Some of them like an E*TRADE have their own captive bank, Schwab has their own captive bank, and they're able to deploy a lot of that cash in that manner. So, I would say we would see it as a long-term positive situation as long as those folks can continue to find an alternative means of offsetting the level of trading income that they've been experiencing over the past couple of years. But as you're well aware, that level of income has been coming down throughout the broker dealer marketplace. Okay. So, I don't see it having a much of a major impact on our business at all. And then Jim, what about the impact of a CECL within your loan portfolio was very unique. With CECL reserve methodology starting next year, I'm curious what the impact will be on your future provisioning. Hey, Matt, it's David. Good morning. Good morning. Stay tuned on CECL. We are preparing to provide a lot more detail and its potential impact on – in our Form 10-Q which will be filed in early November. Okay. Great. Thanks. If I could sneak one more in, David. The tax rate have been volatile so far this year. What's the outlook on the tax rate for the fourth quarter and looking to next year? So, Matt, as you know we routinely evaluate a number of tax planning strategy, historic tax credits, as well as alternative energy. And as always, that effective tax rate in any given quarter is the impact of both the timing of that, as well as a proportion of consolidated earnings attributable to the bank versus investment management. The change this quarter was driven by an unexpected outlook in terms of a tax credit that may not close now this year, which caught us by surprise. And it was also driven by really strong pre-tax net income growth. So, we see the effective tax rate being somewhere around 15% for the remainder of the year. Our next question today comes from Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Good morning. Good morning, Steve. I apologize for jumping on in late. So, if my question has been asked, I apologize for that. Just I do want to start on expenses. Any update or outlook you can give on there and in particular just the drivers in the compensation line, if that's sticky? Steve, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. We've had a focus on operating leverage for a number of years. Growing revenue to meaningfully higher rate than expenses. And we've been able to do this. And to put it into context, two years ago, we were growing at expenses at 17%. Last year, we're growing at 11% to 12%. This year our stated goal is to grow it at under 10%. And we're accomplishing that goal so far. And we're going to work hard to continue to grow that – to grow expenses that are less than double-digit pace. This is an organization that is highly motivated by incentive compensation. Virtually every employee is on some sort of incentive comp program. And so, its pre-tax net income rises, and you see the production levels that we're seeing in swap income across the loan book et cetera, compensation increases. And so that increases proportionately in accordance with the growth. So that's really what the driver is for the comp increase this quarter. Steve, this is Jim. If you look at the financial metrics that we really pay a lot of attention to, you'll see – if you compare the first nine months of 2018 and first nine months of 2019, you'll see that our revenue was up 18% and our expenses and we had indicated to folks in January, we expected to have our expenses in a single digit number for this year and the expenses were up 8%. And we really pay an awful lot of attention to pre-tax net income because we feel that's the core of the company. And you can analyze the core looking at that. And that's up year-to-date for the first nine months, over 20% and the EPS is up about 11%. So that EPS and that pre-tax is what drives the metrics and a lot of our compensation programs here to be candid with you. Right. That's helpful. And then my second question just wondering given the your current version we saw here in the quarter and the challenges at end of the quarter, if you could quantify that impact to the margin for the quarter. Any help from that would be great. Well, I'll let David work to quantify it. But let me let me talk to you a little bit about our perspective on net interest margin, okay, for the business that we're building. We're building a business where relationships are paramount and we continue to be gathering relationship deposits to fund a very high quality borrowers credit needs. We're also building a business that's much leaner like you're probably aware that net interest income doesn't include any type of expenses. And so, our noninterest expenses are about 25% to 30% less than other organizations of our size. If you take a look at the risk profile that's not there and the net interest margin, our earning assets are dramatically different than other institutions and we would argue lower risk in that case. And NIM at our bank and others does not reflect the competitive advantage we enjoy from having a branchless operation. We're also generating about 30% of our revenue from noninterest income that isn't there either. And if you look at our marketable securities-backed loans, particularly the large dollar variety, well, they're lower in spread that contributes to our ongoing reductions in our efficiency ratio that's now for the bank around 50%. We also believe we've been a leader in deposit pricing and while competitors catch up, we expect our funding cost to moderate through the second half of 2019, assuming the Fed Funds target rate ranges maintain or incrementally lowered in the back half of the year. David, do you want to comment? Yes. Steve, as Jim has so well described, it's a business model that he formulated more than 10 years ago that is very agile and can demonstrate good growth and good results in a variety of environments. About 95% of our loan book is variable rate, about 75% of our deposit book is variable rate. And so, as you heard Jim talk about, as we've seen the cost of funds come down measurably in the quarter, there are times when effective Fed Funds and LIBOR, those two relationships get a little bit out of whack when LIBOR is anticipating a Fed cut, which occurred in the quarter. I don't have an exact number, but I would estimate that impact to be somewhere between $600,000 and $800,000 of impact for the third quarter. All right. Thank you very much. The next question today is a follow-up from Russell Gunther of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a bit of a ticky-tacky question, David. I heard you on the recommitment to high-single-digit expense growth for this year. Maybe just a little color for modeling purposes on the dynamic going forward within the state capital shares tax, please. Sure. So we had the benefit of a one-time item this quarter that we work very carefully with external advisors. It was a strategy that we identified. We talked to the State of Pennsylvania about it and we were able to prevail on that. I don't expect it to continue and so I'd expect that we will get back to more historic norms in terms of the share's tax expense. Great. Thanks so much. The next question today comes from Michael Perito with KBW. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks, guys for taking the follow-up questions. Just first, a follow up on the margin. David, I was just looking through the average balance sheet and the cash balances looked a little elevated. Do you have any insight as to – has that normalized since on a period end basis and would that presumably add a little 2 or 3 basis points to the NIM, if those were at a more normalized level in the quarter? They have normalized, Mike. And as we've – I think shared with you on the past, I think you had a question on this a quarter or two ago given where the rate environment is at the moment. We've been staying liquid ensured and then holding cash and cash equivalents versus putting money to work in the investment portfolio right now. So, liquidity is strong and it will remain strong and we really like the balance sheet position at the moment. Got it. And then I was wondering, David, can you provide us and I don't know if some of you have it handy, but the incremental assets and liabilities that you're adding to the balance sheet, can you maybe share with the spread or the margin looks like on that relative to kind of the legacy balance sheet? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is trying to get a sense of where that 75% variable deposits, 95% variable loans. As you guys grow though, I imagine the incremental funding costs will come down. I'm just trying to get a better sense of that dynamic if you have any figures around that. Let me give you some facts, and hopefully, it gives you enough color. Let me start on deposits. Our CD book is about a seven-month duration right now, and the yield on that is about 2.50% at the moment. Where new CDs are being issued somewhere around 1.80% to 1.85%, and so good pricing opportunities there as that very short CD portfolio matures and reprises. On the loan side, we're putting new C&I loans on somewhere between 2.15% and 2.50% over LIBOR. Commercial real estate is going on somewhere between 2.25% and to 2.50%, 2.60% over LIBOR, and then private banking's going on at about 1.50% to 2.50% over LIBOR. And so that's where pricing stands at the moment. We continue to feel that we've got a really good agile business model and can respond to a variety of interest rate scenarios. Got it. Helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Welcome. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Getz for any closing remarks. Thank you very much for your continued interest in TriState Capital and your participation today. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in January. Have a great and Happy New Year. This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day and welcome to the Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., Earnings Conference Call and Webcast for Third Quarter 2019. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Daniel Schrider, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our conference call to discuss Sandy Spring Bancorp's performance for the third quarter of 2019. This is Dan Schrider speaking, and I'm joined here today by my colleagues Phil Mantua, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aaron Kaslow, General Counsel for Sandy Spring Bancorp. As usual, today's call is open to all investors, analysts, and the media. There'll be a live webcast of today's call and a replay available on our website later today. Before we get started covering highlights from the quarter and taking your questions, Aaron will give the customary Safe Harbor statement. Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Sandy Spring Bancorp will make forward-looking statements in this webcast that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements of goals, intentions, earnings and other expectations; estimates of risks and future costs and benefits; assessments of probable loan and lease losses; assessments of market risks; and statements of the ability to achieve financial, and other goals. These forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or affected by management's estimates and projections of future interest rates, market behavior, other economic conditions, future laws and regulations and a variety of other matters, which by their very nature are subject to significant uncertainties. Because of these uncertainties, Sandy Spring Bancorp's actual future results may differ materially from those indicated. In addition, the company's past results of operations do not necessarily indicate its future results. Thank you, Aaron. I am pleased to report today that we delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter. The results show that we're hitting on all cylinders and that all key segments of the company are contributing to our overall success. Our ability to execute on the fundamentals is solid, and we're going to use this momentum to springboard through the fourth quarter. As you know, last month we also announced our plans to acquire Revere Bank. I'll comment on this partnership a little later. However, the results from this past quarter put us in a great position as we prepare to begin integrating Revere into Sandy Spring. Our continued success is evidence that our highly personalized approach to client service works. As we grow, we remain deeply committed to delivering the personal service our customers have come to know and being a true advocate for our clients. There are a few areas I want to highlight from the press release we issued this morning. Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was $29.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.2 million, also $0.82 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018 and net income of $28.3 million or $0.79 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019. We achieved a 10% increase in deposit growth from year-end 2018 and our loan-to-deposit ratio went from 111% to 102%. The year-to-date deposit growth included a 19% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a 45% reduction in wholesale deposits. This impressive increase in deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost borrowings, which decreased by $533 million from year-end and provided a positive impact on net interest income. All year we have executed our business plans to strategically grow core deposits, and we continue to see great results from our teams in both retail and commercial banking. Our net interest margin was at 3.51% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 3.71% for the third quarter of 2018 and 3.54% for the linked second quarter. The prior year's quarterly margin included a $2 million recovery, so it would have otherwise been 3.6%. Quarter to quarter, we've also seen a significant reduction in interest costs. This was driven by substantial end market deposit growth, coupled with lower interest expense on FHLB borrowing. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, total loans increased 3% and commercial loans grew 6%. Specifically, funded loan production increased 62% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by an increase in utilization and an increased level of commercial production. Commercial loans were offset by a decline in the mortgage portfolio due to refinance activity and our strategic decision to sell the majority of new mortgage loan production. Non-performing loans in the third quarter totaled $40 million compared to $38 million in the prior quarter and $33 million in the third quarter of 2018. This modest increase is primarily due to an increase in segments of the portfolio secured by residential real estate. We're working with these consumer borrowers to get them current, and we feel very confident about resolution. We had a truly remarkable quarter generating non-interest income, delivering a 24% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Notably our mortgage banking activities were up by $2.7 million, and we achieved growth in both wealth and insurance. We saw a 6% increase in non-interest expenses in the third quarter, which can be attributed to several non-run rate items. This includes higher compensation costs associated with hiring bonuses and seasonal incentive-based sales programs, one-time marketing expenses and the beginning of some M&A expense as well as the cost of consolidating a couple of our office locations,  which is the (00:06:08) last items related to the WashingtonFirst acquisition. However, these items were significantly offset by a reduction in FDIC insurance expenses. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio came in at 50.95% for the third quarter compared to 49.27% for the same quarter of the prior year. The company had total risk-based capital ratio of 12.70%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 11.37%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.52% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.96%. Overall, our capital position remains in good shape to fuel continued growth. Like to now update you on a couple of other initiatives and news at Sandy Spring. As previously mentioned last month, we announced our intent to acquire Revere Bank. Revere is a strategic end market acquisition that will deepen our presence in our core market and push us through the $10 billion threshold in a meaningful way. Upon closing, which we anticipate to occur late in the first quarter of 2020, we'll be more than $11 billion in assets offering sophisticated products and services, delivered in a very personal way and focused on helping our clients and communities achieve success. As we prepare to begin the integration, we are focused on ensuring a seamless transition for our clients and employees alike. With Revere Bank's Co-CEOs, Ken Cook and Drew Flott joining Sandy Spring in executive roles, we are confident that we'll achieve just that. In other leadership news, we also recently welcomed a new General Counsel and Executive Vice President to the company, Aaron Kaslow. Aaron joined our company last quarter upon the retirement of our prior General Counsel. Aaron comes with extensive experience working with financial service companies of all sizes, as well as a deep understanding of this local market. And we also continue to look for ways to invest in our people and to prepare for the next generation. That's why this quarter we launched a training and development program aimed at preparing individuals for a career specifically in commercial banking. Wherever possible we want to grow from within and provide meaningful career paths for our employees. Through this program, and other training and development initiatives we have throughout the bank, we will continue to build out a pipeline of talented professionals to serve our local business community and help ensure our sustained success. So, overall, we're very happy with the quarter and as evidence that we are producing the kind of results that we need, the strategic acquisition of Revere enhances the momentum we already have working in our favor and we look forward to continuing to build on that success. So, this concludes my general comments for today and we will now move to your questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Casey Whitman with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Casey. Hi, Casey. Hi. Just wanted to start with the expenses. First, I think you just mentioned a bunch of kind of more one-time items that have impacted this quarter between bonuses, marketing, maybe some consolidation of back office. Can you be, I guess, more specific as to actually what those numbers were this quarter impacting the expenses? Yeah, Casey, this is Phil. Hi, Phil. I think when you take all the things that Dan mentioned, add those up in comparison to the kind of rebate, we want to call it, related to the FDIC insurance, there's about a net differential of about $1 million. That are all, really, in our eyes, kind of one-time or seasonal type of expenses here in this particular quarter. So if you take that and move that back out, we were effectively flat to the prior quarter when you met everything in each direction. Okay, got it. So you're saying those expenses all around $2 million versus the $1.2 million FDIC insurance? That's correct. Yeah. Okay. That's exactly right. Okay. $2.2 million versus $1.2 million, you net out to about $1 million difference. Got it. Okay. And then, another question just on the FDIC assessment credit, do you expect to get a credit in the fourth quarter as well, and do you have any idea what that amount might be or should we not consider that in? Yeah. We certainly believe we could. I'm not sure that we know for sure that we will. I don't believe if we do, it will be as large as the credit we got in this quarter just based on what might remain. So as an estimate, we might get maybe half of what that looked like this quarter in the fourth quarter if we get it at all. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then let me just ask you about the margin. You did a very nice job of holding it this quarter. I guess what – Phil, what's your outlook there just over the next few quarters with potentially more rate cuts and before we get Revere in there? Yeah, I would think that we'll probably trend down a little bit into the high 3.40% range in the next quarter or so. We're going to see the bigger impact of the September cut obviously coming through in future periods as well, as an expectation that there'll be another cut here shortly. So, I would think overall margin levels in the mid-3.40s for the fourth quarter and then into the first part of next year prior to the acquisition. Our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Catherine. Hi, Catherine. Maybe one follow-up to Casey's expense question. How are you thinking about expense growth as we move into next year and you're building up towards the $10 billion cross? Yeah, Catherine, this is Phil. Absent again of what we know will happen when we combine the two companies towards the end of the first quarter, just kind of legacy Sandy Spring, I would – we would love to probably grow expenses just naturally 4% to 5% on an annualized basis. I don't know that we really see a significant amount of additional buildup relative to crossing $10 billion. I think we've talked about this for a while that we feel like we've made other investments to this point in a variety of ways that put us in a pretty good position for doing just that. Okay. Great. Perfect. And then on the growth outlook, can you talk to us a little bit about how you're thinking about growth and how much of the strategy to sell residential mortgages you think will continue into next year? Catherine, Dan. I think that was – that decision was driven by a couple of things. One is to become much more effective in driving mortgage production from new sales, home sales as well as refinances. And so we've moved the percentage of our production from our realtor connections and centers of influence on the sales side of residential much higher than we had in the past. As you recall, we were highly dependent upon our construction firm business. So, I think we've achieved great success in driving the type of production we want. That all occurred at the same time that the competitive rates on the construction firm business and the terms being offered by some key competitors just made that a less attractive business for us. So, I think as that business returns, I think this is not a forever phenomena in terms of the competitive market around the construction firm. We'll hopefully see production come back, which would be portfolio production. And while at the same times maximizing our opportunity to sell. So, that clearly has had an impact on net loan growth over the course of the year. As we continue in this current rate environment, I mean we hope to continue to drive the type of gain on sale numbers but that's – there is a obviously a rate phenomena associated with that. So, as long as we're in this rate cycle, we would expect to continue to see that occur. Good news, on the production front, just to kind of give you a sense behind the scenes, in the current quarter, we had $450 million to $500 million in commercial loan production. We had another north of $400 million in mortgage production. So, we're cranking out north of $850 million in overall production with – between those two books. It's just so much of it went off balance sheet to drive gain. So, we like the momentum in terms of production, and we would expect that to affect loan growth on a go-forward basis in a positive way. Got it. Okay. So as you  (00:15:49) guidance for loan growth for next year maybe on an organic basis outside of Revere, kind of mid to high-single-digit, how are you thinking about that? Yeah, I think that's fair based upon what we've seen thus far in 2019 and the production momentum that we're seeing now. Okay. All right. Great. And then one last if I could, any thoughts on CECL, and what's the one-time increase to the reserve will be in 1Q 2020? That was an open-ended question, Catherine. (00:16:20) So a lot of things you could talk about there. No comment in any way, shape or form. Yes. Opinions, all of it, open mind  (00:16:31) We're still working our way through getting ourselves prepared for what that might look like in the first quarter of next year. We're not still at a point where we're comfortable kind of giving an idea as to what that number is going to necessarily look like. Okay. No worries there. All right. Thank you so much. Thanks, Catherine. Thank you. The next question is from Steve Comery with G.research. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hi, Steve. Hi, Steve. Hey, I just wanted to ask about the deposits, really strong growth again like in the second quarter. I was just wondering kind of how much of that you attribute to sort of the seasonal effects you guys usually have, and how much you'd expect that  (00:17:25) going forward? Yeah, Steve, this is Phil. I'm not sure that I would in this particular quarter look at that growth as being seasonal pretty much at all. I think it's a continuation of the momentum we have established in the market even as we've moderated some of our pricing to protect the margin. And when you really kind of peel back what happened there, that deposit growth is actually even stronger because we paid down over $100 million of brokered CDs and allowed another $15 million to $20 million in public funds to run off. So, the real organic market driven growth is quite a bit more and it continues to be in all portions of the deposit base everywhere from commercial checking and noninterest-bearing demand deposits right on through money markets and time. And so I think that it's – I think it's just a continuation of our concentrated focus and efforts on gathering deposits. Okay. Very good. That's all I had. Thank you. Thanks, Steve. Sure. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Daniel Schrider for any closing remarks. Thank you and thanks everyone for joining today's call. We really appreciate you participating and we welcome your feedback, so you can always e-mail that to us at ir@sandyspringbank.com. So, thanks again and have a great afternoon. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Home BancShares, Incorporated Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. The purpose of this call is to discuss the information and data provided in the quarterly earnings release issued this morning. The company presenters will begin with prepared remarks then entertain questions. The company has asked me to remind everyone to refer to their cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. You will find this note on page 3 of their Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February 2019. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode and this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Allison. Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Home BancShares third quarter 2019 earnings release and conference call. With me today is Tracy and Chris and John are on the phone, Brian Davis, Jennifer, Randy, Donna, Kevin, and Stephen, and they all will be available after the presentations. Some of them will be presenting today. The quarter was noisy, a lot of moving parts, including we chose to call a $47.5 million BOLI, the results of which we had a one-time $3.7 million tax associated with it. The yield was up, I don't remember exactly, 1.15%, 1.19%. So we decided to call it. We think we can do better with the money. There were elevated payouts in this quarter and will continue into the next several quarters. Several years ago, we instituted prepayments on many of our credit and that decision has elevated our income for this quarter and will continue in the future. We will remain disciplined on both loan rates and terms, and not fall in the trap of being categorized as stupid banker. We are correct. We think there is a little slowdown in the market and we're not opposed to that. We normally originate about $852 billion per quarter but this quarter, we only originated $710 million, with New York doing $248 million of that at 6.52%, and legacy doing $462 million at 5.63%. There were less opportunities in most of our markets, and many banks are racing after those few deals that are out there. It appears to be a race to the dumbest because you're just giving the stuff away. With rates from both bank and both  (00:02:42) offering sub-4s, couple that with 10-year interest only, add in low non-recourse and give an 80% leverage and you've won that deal, congratulations. You have just won the stupid award. Weak banks and bankers are collapsing rates in terms like a pup tent in a hurricane. We're going to do the right thing here and not sacrifice our future for short-term bragging rights. We have made the decision to let $300 million to $400 million walk because the rate term and leverage are not conducive to long-term profitability of our company. Higher leverage, longer terms, low rates is a recipe that most of the crowd appears to be following. Warren Buffett said there is the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of others no matter how foolish it may be. Jamie Dimon's quote was one of the toughest jobs a CEO has is to look at the stupid stuff that other people are doing, not do it himself. These statements come from two American icons and that have proven business and investing skills. We should all listen to these experts. I just want to give you a few of mine. Winners never quit and quitters never win. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. Lead, fall or get out of the way, remain disciplined as hard as it may be. These are really dangerous times for banks. The Street, analysts, shareholders, all apply pressure for growth, growth, growth. This is a time to move cautiously. Banks have spent the last 10 years building their balance sheet with quality high-yielding assets and we could destroy all the good we've built in much less time than it took to build it. The Fed has dropped rates 50 basis points, but the market has dropped to 150 basis points to 200 basis points. I can assure you that cost of funds have not fallen as fast as loan rates so we know what happens to profit. It's pretty simple. Banks should not sell their future for short-term bragging rights. However, it appears that banks are dropping their rates much faster than they want to. This is a major sign of weakness in the quality of the producers and the relationship they have with their customers. Relationships are the most important ingredient in keeping customers in times like this. Some customers will disappoint regardless but most will stay with you. This is the path that HOMB has chosen. We will not sell our future because of a short run in the market – short downturn in the market, quite the contrary. We made the decision to build additional capital for the next year or two. In the event that there really is a downturn, probably $150 million to $200 million rise, that is if we're able to maintain our best-in-class profitability. We'll be working on continuing to improve our asset quality as good as it is, improve our operations, service our customers by spending more face time with them and work on efficiency. A little slowdown will pass but if you sell your soul to the devil now, they'll take a long time to get back just even, much less produce the best-in-class numbers as this company is known nationally for. Now, let's talk about the quarter. I'm pretty proud of the quarter. EPS of $0.44; return on assets, 1.93%, and efficiency of 39.16%, and a net interest margin of 4.32%. That had a little juice in it as $2.8 million in prepays kind of juiced it up a little bit. I was telling  Jimmy Han (00:06:16) about that and he said don't take that away from yourself. Give yourself credit for that because you had the foresight to put the prepays in, so he said, good job. So we got a lot of those in. You're going to see a lot of that rolling in over the next period of time. Deposit rates are coming down slowly and asset quality is as good as it's been. Non-performing loans to loans at 0.54% and non-performing assets to assets at 0.45%; I don't remember when they've been that low. Good expense control, excess loan yield of 6.08% from 6.06%, and we grew tangible book by 15% year-over-year. I just looked over the last five years and I wanted to share with our shareholders. Over the past five years, we have grown tangible book from $4.95 to $8.83. That's a 78.38% increase, while at the same time, buying back our stock with a value of $212 million, and that represents 10,842,000 shares. Had we not bought back stock, it would have increased our tangible book to 91.51% over the five years. We have paid dividends to our shareholders of $320 million and we've earned over $1 billion. We have returned  a profit of (00:07:33) 50% of our income to our shareholder through stock repurchase and dividends. Not many banks could have accomplished these amazing tasks while at the same time improving capital ratios. This speaks to the amazing profitability of this company. Good job, all. That's why Home is named Best Bank in America by Forbes for the second year in a row. Buying back stock, growing tangible book, paying a strong dividend and growing capital all at the same time, certainly, this company has made the proper decisions for the long term for all involved, and I can assure you, we'll continue to do that in the future. Thank you for your support and Brian Davis is going to cover more in depth on margin for us. Brian? Thanks, Mr. Allison. The third quarter was a good quarter for our net interest income and net interest margin. I'm pleased to report the third quarter net interest margin of 4.32% was up 4 basis points from the 4.28% for the second quarter. On a tax equivalent basis, we recorded net interest income of $144.2 million for Q3 2019 compared to $142.3 million for Q2 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the interest rate environment began to decline. For example, the 10-year Treasury went from 2.50% on March 31 to 1.64% on September 30. This decline has increased the prepayment speeds on our investment securities. As a result, we saw an increase in premium amortization of $515,000 from Q1 to Q2. Then, we saw an additional increase in premium amortization of $373,000 from Q2 to Q3. If the premium amortizations had remained flat from Q1 to Q3, our Q3 margin would have been an additional 3 basis points higher. Last year, we had a few large payoff events which increased our margin. The first six months of 2019 did not include any additional income or large payoff events. However, the third quarter of 2019, we had several interest income events primarily related to large payoffs. These events totaled $2.8 million of interest income, and increased net interest margin by 8.4 basis points for the third quarter of 2019. Accretion income for the fair value adjustments recorded in purchase accounting was $8.5 million during Q3 compared to $9.2 million during Q2 for a decrease of $778,000. This decrease lowered our NIM by 2.5 basis points. Another positive for Q3 was that we were able to keep the yield on interest-earning assets flat while lowering the cost of funds on interest-bearing deposits by 4 basis points from Q2. As a result, we reported an improvement of approximately $4,000 of additional net interest income per day for Q3 2019 when compared to Q2. With that said, I'll turn the call back to Mr. Allison. Thank you, Brian. That's good stuff. Next, we're going to hear from Chris Poulton. Chris, how are you? Yes, sir. Good afternoon. Thank you. As noted, our third quarter was highlighted by a lower ending loan balance than higher fee-related revenues. For the quarter, assets fell in what has become a bit of a seasonal trend. After positive net growth in Q2, we had $171 million of net portfolio decline. You may recall, we had similar results in Q2 and Q3 of 2018, with declines this quarter specifically driven largely by net payoffs which totaled approximately $350 million. Specifically, payoffs on facilities and revolving line made up about 40% of the total. These facilities typically increase and decrease over time, and we expect that at least some if not all of this decrease would be reversed over the coming months and quarters. Quarter-to-quarter increases and decreases in our overall portfolio are expected. And as we have discussed on prior calls, they are a feature of our product line. Larger paydown quarters are also generally accompanied by higher fee-related income. Q3 was no exception as we collected additional fee and interest income as a result of these movements in the portfolio. On the production side, year-to-date originations have been trending approximately $100 million ahead of last year, and remain happy with the pipeline of expected closings between now and the end of the year. Right now, based on transactions and underwriting, CCFG is forecasted to have our highest year of production since joining Centennial Bank. With that, Johnny, I'll hand it back over to you. Thank you, Chris. Good report. John? John Marshall, you here? Yes, sir. Good afternoon. Good afternoon to you. And thank you, Mr. Allison, for the opportunity to provide this third quarter update on behalf of Shore Premier Finance. Net interest earning assets increased $15 million in the quarter to reach $85 million in total growth since being acquired by Centennial Bank back in July 2018. The growth in the quarter may be attributed to a nice mix of robust retail originations, higher withdrawals on floor plan lines despite seasonal pullback in utilization rates and slightly reduced prepayment speeds. Retail application volume was flat compared to the second quarter, but the dollar value was higher. We also booked an additional $14 million in floor plan lines, adding four new manufacturers that will result in increased future funding opportunities. I'm encouraged with the additional floor plan lines and the higher seasonal utilization in advance of the upcoming boat show season that will contribute to additional growth. To further stimulate growth, we're also introducing a new super yacht retail finance program. After months of research and due diligence, we believe there's a financing opportunity in the super yacht space defined as boats over 80 feet with hull values in excess of $7 million. We've observed a shift in consumer sentiment as the market bulls charge forward and recession appears to have been averted for consumers to achieve a positive arbitrage between their portfolio returns and the cost of their boat loan. The falling credit rate environment is also further fueling that fire. Additional good news is we're favorable to our income goals by 10%. Lower provision expense and the lean nature of our business with an efficiency rate below 30% have helped to boost profits. Across the $420 million retail portfolio, weighted average rates climbed 3 basis points in the quarter. However, variably priced commercial advances are more immediately reactive to the vagaries in the market and experienced a 24 basis point pullback in rates. Our contribution to the bank's net interest income continues to increase each month. Also favorable to target were our asset quarterly metrics, both compared to goal and prior quarter. 30-plus days delinquent loans reached a historical low of 20 basis points or $875,000. Non-performing loans at quarter-end were just under $2 million, 6 basis points favorable to target. As a harbinger of future asset quality trends, retail originations in the quarter average FICO scores improved to 778, so very high quality paper. And we experienced no commercial delinquency. Overall, I'm pleased with the team's performance and encouraged as we move into the fourth quarter. With that, I'll conclude my remarks and turn the discussion back over to you, Mr. Allison. Thank you, John. Good report. I like those past dues 20 basis points, that's good stuff. We're going to go to Tracy and Stephen. I guess I'll go to you Tracy and you'll go to Stephen, right? All right, Jonny. Thank you.  (00:15:25) outstanding report of Home BancShares numbers and listening to Chris, Brian, and John, I'm proud to discuss another strong quarter for Centennial Bank. For the quarter, Centennial Bank's return on assets was 2.08%, ran an efficiency ratio of 37%, and continue with some strong revenue, $173 million. We continue to navigate through a challenging interest rate environment, obviously with the last two rate decreases in the recent quarter and potentially more on horizon. Our bankers are focused on the long-term, cultivating relationships while maximizing returns for this company and our shareholders. Stephen will go over some details next, but I'd like to point out, we are pleased with our deposit growth over the year as the focus has been on core deposit relationships. On the loan front, as Johnny addressed earlier, our lenders have been busy working opportunities on staying with prudent underwriting terms and rates. This has proven to work for our company over time, while not betting our future on near-term results. I'd like to congratulate our mortgage company led by Keith Little, along with his sales staff and his operations team for a very strong and busy, busy quarter. As I mentioned, I'm pleased to see the improvement in an already strong asset quality metrics. I want to compliment all of our lending team for their continued effort in this competitive landscape. I'm going to ask Stephen Tipton to give a little more detail on the loans and deposits. Stephen? Thank you, Tracy. I'll give some color on production payoffs and the balance sheet movement for the quarter. We saw community bank production a little over $460 million in the third quarter, which includes $47 million in production from Shore Premier. As Johnny mentioned, the community bank loan production slowed somewhat in Q3, but the contribution split remain consistent among the Arkansas, Florida and Alabama regions. As it has been mentioned, payoff volume increased to $721 million in the third quarter of 2019, which is a couple hundred million in excess of what we have seen in prior quarters. Chris has already highlighted the CCFG paydown and payoff activity, and the increased activity on the community bank side came primarily from Arkansas as several large development projects stabilized and moved to the permanent market a little sooner than expected. On the deposit side, we generally see some seasonality in the third quarter with the schools and municipalities we have in our footprint. We also saw customers with insurance moneys flow out as the areas previously affected by Hurricane Michael rebuild. As such, linked quarter balances declined $300 million, while year-over-year balance is increased $422 million. The growth in the first half of 2019 has allowed us to take a look at higher tier pricing on interest-bearing deposit balances. As we move forward, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for pricing improvement while managing the funding needs of the company. With that, I'll turn it back over you, Mr. Allison. Thank you very much. We'll go to Randy Sims for the wrap up. Randy? Thank you, Johnny. Well, congratulations to everyone for another great but, as you heard, very noisy quarter. But even with the mix of transactions, as you heard from everyone, the numbers are once again very, very good. So, let me just recap some of those strong numbers from Home BancShares and wrap this quarter up. We finished the quarter with total assets of $14,901,935 billion. Income was $72.8 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.44 as compared to $0.43 from the last quarter, which meets our market expectations. Our ROA was very strong, up a little at 1.93%, but consistent with the last two quarters at 1.92%. More importantly, quarter-end September produced a strong net interest margin at 4.32%, up 4 basis points from the last quarter at 4.28%. As you heard from our CFO, Brian Davis, there were several influencing variables on both sides of the equation. But it's safe to say we're very pleased with the consistency of the NIM over the past several quarters, that is a key factor in our higher performance. On the other side and once again, our profitability was helped by a very strong efficiency ratio of 39.16% as we continue to control our cost. Average deposits for the quarter were up just a little at $11.17 billion, but down for the quarter on its ending balance at $11.05 billion, resulting in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 97.5%, up a little bit, consistent from 97.4% at June 30. Average loans were down a little for the quarter at $10.9 billion versus $11 billion at June 30. However, ending loans were down $281 million for the quarter, at $10.8 billion, indicative of our refusal to compromise our terms and right for short-term gain. Our asset quality has and continues to be solid, with all the ratios at record lows indicating a very optimistic and secure outlook. As you heard our Chairman, our tangible book value per common share, non-GAAP, was at $8.83. And you heard him talk about the tremendous growth in that value, especially over the last five years. We now have three quarters behind this, and our strategy has not changed, protect the margin for the future, avoid the crazy deals in the market, repurchase stock, grow tangible book, improve asset quality, and control expenses. Consistency in our key metrics, this is what we do. And that pretty much wraps everything up, and I'll turn it back over to Mr. Allison. Thank you, Randy. I appreciate it. I've got some really interesting charts here, but I really didn't have time to – how many banks? 69 banks. 68. Sixty eight banks and they are, where the parent is in the US, non-Puerto Rican banks, and excluding Raymond James and Sallie Mae. And it ranks us over the time, over the last two years, in net margin, return on assets, return on equity, tangible common equity versus tangible assets, dividend yield, efficiency ratio; and just for everybody's benefit, Home just doesn't – stands out in this with high rating in every one of those categories. Makes me very proud. I appreciate our bankers for what they've done and we'll continue to work hard. I wish I had more time to go over that. We may make some travel receipts for that when we travel in the future. Those are pretty, pretty important numbers. I think, at this point in time, does anybody have anything else? Chuck, are you ready for us to go to Q&A? Yes. We'll now begin the Q&A session. Brett will.... The first question will come from Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, sir. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Afternoon, Brett. I wanted to first ask maybe Johnny, can you talk about – you talked about stability in the market. Can you maybe just give us a flavor for what you're walking away from from a pricing or terms perspective? Kind of give us some flavor of lines you're not willing to cross. And then also wanted us to hear origination rates, kind of what you're expecting kind of given where rates have gone relative to the current portfolio. Well, sometimes it's a good time to book a lot of loans and sometimes it's not a good time to book a lot of loans. But as the Fed dropped 50 basis points, I'm telling you, the lenders dropped 150 basis points to 200 basis points, and we're just not going to play at that level. We're beginning to see if it is – as I said, it's a dangerous time, we're beginning to see loans in the threes. We're seeing 80% leverage. We're seeing a non-recourse mixed in. It is a time to be very, very cautious. I mean, as I said in my remarks, banks are probably in the best financial condition that they've been in in ever maybe, at least we are, to take a chance in these kind of markets and go back to 80% leverage just doesn't make any sense. We're just not going to do it. We made the decision several years ago on some pre-pays; I mean, to put prepayment penalties in. And I think you'll see over the next quarter or two, we made the decision to let $300 million to $400 million leave that's here presently right now, but we're not going to go sell our future. So, you're seeing threes, you're seeing it non-recourse, you're seeing high leverage, you're seeing the things that we saw back before the before 2008 crash. We're just not going to play. This is my largest asset, and we're just going to protect our asset. We'll book the good loans, and we'll let the others go away. Okay. That's good color. The other thing I was curious about, you obviously defended the margin while in 3Q with the help of the prepays. Can you maybe just talk about the kind of go-forward outlook? You'd be able to reduce funding costs, I assume, on a slightly higher pace going forward. Maybe just talk about how you think about the margin from here. Hey, Brett. This is Stephen Tipton. Yeah, I think, Brian's got our updated ALCO models here today. I mean, it still shows a little downward pressure in a down 25 basis points or down 50 basis points environment, which is consistent with what we've said last quarter. And yeah, we're constantly working the funding side, the deposit side on where we all saw a report yesterday where we had another $70 million or $80 million in balances that we lowered by 25 basis points. So, some of it, that's a month post the last rate cut. So, some of it is timing related on the deposit side, where we communicate these drops to the customers, but at 96%, 97% loan-to-deposit, we are mindful of balances too. So, that gives a little color for you. I'll add a little color from an ALCO perspective in this. We are asset sensitive when you're pricing gaps about 8.8%, which leaves us about $1.2 billion, that is asset sensitive. You just take the numbers out black box on ALCO model, it would show that a 25 basis points decline could decrease the net interest income, everything held constant about $2 million for a quarter or 6 basis points; and if we went down 50 basis points, it'd be pretty much double that. It would be $4 million for the quarter or potentially 12 basis points. That's assuming that we did nothing to change the mix coming out of the black box on the ALCO model. I think when we travel with you and Donna and I traveled with you, you saw the emphasis that we put on margin and it has been top of mind. I think we're going to see downward pressure a little bit because of competition. We're trying to do the good ones and let the bad ones go by. Some of them are good credits. We're just not going right at 3% non-recourse. We're just not going to do that. I mean, this too shall pass, won't be here forever. And the bank you're going to lock in, I mean we're seeing a lot of 15-, 20-, 25-year stuff. Some banks, a lot of shared banks, but they're locking themselves in for a long time with some of these credits. And we hate to see some of these go, but I think we'll be better off in the long-term, a little  (00:28:10) higher rates in the future. Okay. Great. Appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hey, Mike. Just wanted to circle back to the margin commentary. So, obviously, 7 basis points of prepays, it sounds like you expect some level of prepays going forward to kind of boost the margin. So, should we think about a level that's something around that for the next couple of quarters, just in terms of what you guys are expecting for prepays? I'm just trying to get at what's kind of the starting point for the NIM that we should consider and then build in whatever we're going to build in in terms of rates. Thanks. I think you're going to see a pressure on the NIM coming in, and we have – the originations thus far this quarter have not been at the rate that I wanted them to be. So, that's it. Obviously, we have not originated a lot this quarter. However, the pipeline unfunded is the highest it's ever been. It's about 2 point... $6.47 billion at the end... Almost $2.5 billion, and that then includes Chris Poulton, and Chris has a very strong backlog. So, we have a good backlog. It will give us time to weather this storm, I think. Any other comments on the margin? We had a lot of prepays and you can call it juice if you want to. I was looking for someone to give us credit for having enough foresight to put those prepays in and  Jimmy Hanna did (00:29:53), so thank you, Jimmy. We got a lot of prepays. You don't see a lot of money rolling in the income pretty quick here in the fourth quarter. If all of this stuff gets paid off because there is substantial prepayments. When I'm talking of substantial, I'm talking some big loans with some 4%, 5%, 6% prepayments in them. So, there'll be some substantial income coming in. So, that kind of takes a little sting off then moving it. Absolutely. Right now, it's actually reoccurring, non-reoccurring income. Yeah, no, I completely understand now. It's a good thing, yes, to put that in. Just had a question, I don't think you guys addressed it in the prepared comments. Just wanted to get your thoughts on CECL. So, as I step back and I look at it, you have kind of two buckets of loans that are treated kind of unfairly with the unfunded commitments and then the longer dated marine portfolio. Can you give us some sort of expectation if you have it, what kind of the day one hit might be under CECL and how that might change your appetite to continue to grow CFGs and move forward? Thanks. Well, I'll take the part on the CECL. I mean, well, we have run our models and we're at the point where our auditors, BKD, are in the process of auditing it. They've not given me their thumbs up, thumbs down opinion on it. They've been here a couple of weeks. We're also going through model validation once again. They probably won't be done in a couple of weeks, but haven't gotten the final report on that, so we're not prepared to actually give a number, I mean, but we do anticipate that the ALLL will go up a little bit. Of course, that will be a hit to capital. We do anticipate being able to take advantage of the three-year phase-in from a risk-based capital standpoint and phase it in over that. As far as us originating or changing our lending, I don't think that that's going to impact a lot in the way that we're doing our loans; I mean, we'll have to fund the ALLL as the loan portfolio grows. But to be honest with you, for a lot of the history of this company, we have done all that already as we grew the loan – when we had handled growing loan portfolio. Our loss  (00:32:22) analyze shows that type of lending we do, we've really not lost a lot of money there. I think your question was asking, could I change any of the different types of loans? Is that what we've seen so far, that wouldn't happen. Hey, Michael. This is Kevin Hester. The weighted average maturities for our portfolio are shorter than you might think. And even in the marine portfolio, those prepayment speeds have been in the, I'm going to say, three- and four-year range out of that portfolio over time. So, it's not going to make as much difference as you might think. Understood. And maybe just one more, just probably on loan growth. It looks like loans could end flat to kind of down this year. I understand why you slowed that. It's two-fold, right? It's prepayments, and it's also been more prudent, not giving away the ship, which I understand. As we as we think about next year, if this dynamic continues flat, I assume you'll take the same stance and we should probably just kind of project a lower rate of growth. Is that a fair way to kind of think about it? Thanks. Well, I hope not. But if the market stays like it is, then – I mean, if the kind of credits we're looking at and the rates we're looking at on those credits now, if that continues into next year, we remain very conservative. Well, there's a lot of stupid words that go around, so. There's a lot of that. I get it. You think about it, what happened in 2005, 2006, and 2007 and 2008, we were like putting money in a deal. There was no money  (00:34:06) construction, but really there was no money in them. We all bankers learned our lesson in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 is we got kicked in the tail. We just weren't – we don't want to go back to that, as this is – we're not interested in that kind of business. It doesn't make any sense to loan money at 3%. It's just ridiculous. So, we're just going to keep, as I say, just hold steady here, is what we're going to do. No, I get it. We all like Johnny Prime better than the alternative. Thank you. Yeah. We may go back to Johnny Prime. Don't mention that, Michael. Exactly. (00:34:43). That's what we did then. We just went to  Warren Wright (00:34:46) and said, take it or leave it, right? Worked out pretty good for us. We're just being conservative. We're just being ultra, ultra conservative in a market that is – when you see the Fed drop 50 basis points and bankers drop by 150 basis points to 200 basis points on loan, it was kind of crazy. It was almost like they turned out the wild animals at one point in time and they were just running indifferent. We got a quote for this, and so and so is going to do this. And Tracy now we're in Orlando talking to this big developer and he's in luck. He said, I'm getting 3.25%, 7% – I mean, 3.25%, 7-year non-recourse; 3.5%, 10-year non-recourse. And he said,  (00:35:30) I said, well, we don't do that. That's not what we do, and we're not going to do that. So, you just have to let him know you're not going to play that game; however, we might get that  (00:35:41). Tracy, do you think? I think you're right. Yeah. So, anyways, you just got to get it. Relationships are extremely important right now. You're disappointed in some people, but most people would stand up to the relationship. Thanks. No, I get it. Great color, guys. Thanks. Thanks for your questions. The next question will come from Brady Gailey of KBW. Please go ahead, sir. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Hey, Brady. When you look at loan growth and, I guess, loan shrinkage for you guys, the payoffs, are they coming out of one specific geography? Like is it CFG or Arkansas or Florida, or is it kind of across the entire Home Bank franchise? We'll let Chris talk to CFG, speak to his CFG. Chris, once you speak to that, we'll speak to legacy. Sure. Hey, Brady. Yeah, no, I think we're seeing – for us, I think we see our normal level of payoffs. They come in different months, right? So, I don't know that we're seeing anything happen on payoffs that we haven't seen happen before. Our challenge is that convincing our customers to pay off in an even one-twelfth fashion over the years is a little tough to do, so some quarters get higher than others. But the only maybe a little difference this time was some of the elevation and payoff was in facilities, which is a little different in that we do have an expectation that those facilities remain outstanding, and borrowers tend to re-borrow. And so, we had one larger payoff that hit this quarter that was in the facility, and we'd have an anticipation that some of that will get refunded back up over the next life of a facility which is generally another year or two. And so that might have been a little different, but in general, I think we're seeing kind of the same things we normally see. From our perspective, we have a multi-family builder that is about $120 million, and the decision was to let it go, because it's 3.25% non-recourse. We don't do that, and we're not going to do that. And we hate to lose it, but there's also $4 million worth of prepays on it. So, that takes a little sting off when you get $4 million worth of prepays on one set. Another paydown that happened this quarter was one that we wanted to happen. It's a multi-family – couple of multifamily units. That was a classified credit that we thought was fine, but the regulators didn't like it. So, we moved it. It was able to get financed elsewhere with another bank, much bigger bank, and they took it out. So, not only – some of this is by design that we've moved out. I think someone asked about the two credits we had – the  two four credits that moved to fives. Both of them (00:38:45) moved to fives. One of them is – Kevin's ready to upgrade it, but  (00:38:51) payoff it appears, and it has a prepayment on it. So, that was gone. The other one was a complex in the Panhandle of Florida, and there's been no change on it. We're not worried about that credit anyway. But there's been no change on it. But some of it was us and some of it was the market and some of it was pricing. For us to look at long-term fixed rate stuff, non-recourse, we're not ready to do that. All right. So, if loan growth is not going to be robust at least in the near-term, I know, Johnny, you've been able to successfully grow EPS via M&A. Do you look to M&A a little more aggressively now that loan growth is slowing here? I think we do. We have seen – I don't know what's going on, Brady, but there's lots of banks coming at us. We've seen more banks in the last six weeks than I've seen in six or eight months, coming at us. Some of them make sense, some of them don't make sense, but that could be a plus for us down the road. We're just starting to play with that. We really hadn't been real serious about M&A, but I think we're getting much more serious now. What do you got to say to that, Tracy? Opportunities are definitely more now than what they have been and expectation's still little rich for us, but they're coming down though, that's my point. The expectations are coming down a little bit. I don't know if everybody's afraid Elizabeth Warren is going to win and banks will be in big time trouble or – but there's something going on out there that's generating, I don't know if it's regulators, I really don't know what it is, but there's something. They're coming at us faster than we anticipated them coming at us. And Johnny, just remind us, like I know a lot of the deals you've done in the past have been scratch and dent. Is that still the focus? And then, what is kind of the size, range of targets that you would potentially look at, and then what geographies are most attractive to you? Oh, I don't know if size is important. We did the Stonegate deal, and from a shareholder value perspective, we didn't get anything out of that. It was a good lesson for us to learn. It is important in some markets to get the blessing of the shareholders of an organization. So, I think we probably would be looking at a smaller-sized organization that gives us that wholesome local shareholder flare that you didn't get with Stonegate, not that Stonegate wasn't a good trade for us, it turned out be a good profitable trade for us and great deposit market for us. But we didn't get the  (00:41:42) of the shareholders we would get on a smaller transaction. And I think that's important to the value of the company because if it's heavily fund owned, then it's just gone overnight, right? They don't get paid until they don't get their  (00:41:57) or 20% or 50%, whatever their pay is until they sell the stock and get paid. So, that's a good lesson for us to learn. But the bottom line to it is, is which one is the most accretive to EPS for Home BancShares? And that would probably be one that is somewhere around our markets because of the savings that we could generate. I still like Texas and I've talked about it a lot, but we don't get a lot of savings out there. If we did a deal or two in and around Florida, I think we could pick up some good savings and probably pick up some shareholder value. Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Hi, Jon. Hey. Just a quick follow up on that, on Brady's question on number of banks coming at you. How was the quality of those companies in general, quality of the loan books? Well, I don't know till we get in, but... Yeah. I'd say from – we have to do that. I'd say they're across the board. Some of them may have stubbed their toes and I guess they don't want to stub the toes and I guess they just put up a for sale sign. It's just a matter of price. I mean obviously, this team – management team knows what to do with a failed bank. They bought seven or eight of them, so it all has to do with the price of the bank and what it does to Home. But I think overall, banks are in the best shape they've been in in many, many, many years so I think most of them are good. It just depends on what it does. We're not going to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal. We don't do a deal, it makes sense for our shareholders and that is accretive to EPS for our shareholders, and add some additional value or maybe a different market. But we can't get much say in this as we go outside Florida or Alabama or Arkansas unless Chris wants to buy something in New York and I don't think he's interested in doing that so... All right. Also, you've been clear on your view on the Fed but big picture thoughts on rates from any of you. Is there like a directional bias that you're managing to in terms of your company? You think we're going lower or stay the same? I think we're going lower. Some people think we're going to go negative, maybe a quarter or two. I think we may see that. I don't know that it really – it reaches a point where it really didn't stimulate so I think another quarter down or maybe two down will pretty much be the end of it. But some of the bankers, they've already gone there on their rates. They dropped – as I said earlier, raised up 50 base points and they dropped 150 basis points to 200 basis points on the rate so it was kind of chaos out there for a little bit. We just got out. Sometimes it's good time to hold them, sometimes it's good time to fold them. This was not a good time to – not a good quarter to originate new loans based on competition and the silliness that was in the market. So even though we did originate $710 million, a lot of it never got up to our executive loan committee because they flushed it before it ever got here. Jon, Randy Sims was telling me he was at a conference last month and I think that question was asked with all the bankers in the room and we evaluated those answers a year later and they were all completely wrong. That's exactly right. Every year, they ask questions on what our rates going to do, what's the most threatening thing to you – to the best bankers in America. I guess most of them were there and every year, they've been 100% wrong the year later. So I'm kind of the opinion after seeing that two or three years, we need to think what we don't want. Right. So if rates are going down, maybe rates will go up. I don't know. Yeah. Well, you're the only one up, right? A year ago, they went up. Yeah. Last year, they were going up and Tipton told me that somebody called him and said you need to get ready. Rates are going to go down. And I thought, Stephen's buying that  (00:46:39). I should have. It worked. It was just the way the guy called it. Yeah. I'm going to tell you that in this country right now, it's nobody really knows. Things may go – rates will probably go down a little bit, but who knows what'll happen after that. They could just as easily come back up. Yeah. Okay. We're just kind of – we're kind of turning the needle just a little bit as the rates change in the Fed. You have a tendency we're going to twist that knob but we're just tweaking it or doing that business... No, I think it's probably the best thing to do right now till you get to trend. I don't know what the trend is. Appears to me to be down but that doesn't mean it will go down. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then I guess the last question. We kind of periodically bug you on the Home $2 and obviously, the rate environment has changed a little bit, but big picture goals for 2020. Do you have any thoughts on that on where you want to be in... Yeah... Texas (00:47:41)? I'd like to be the $2. I just don't think we need $1 billion worth of loans and it's just tough to get right now. It's tough to get at a decent rate. So it might push our Home $2 by another year in my mind but we'll get there. This has been interesting. It's been interesting. We normally – all the goals we set in the past we hit within like 18 or 24 months and this has been an absolute battle getting here with all the changes and the payoffs and the rates and the rate movements. It's been interesting times but overall, Home has returned to their shareholders over $500 million in the last five years and we earned $1 billion and we've run in close to 2%. So we've been able to manage our way through this crazy environment and produced still best-in-class results. So hopefully, we can continue to do that in the future, Jon. Yeah. No, that's quality. I agree so thanks for the help. Appreciate it. You bet. Thank you. The next question will come from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. How's everyone doing? We're good. Stephen, I enjoyed spending time with your people in Atlanta the other day. I heard that. You guys have both been in Atlanta and not come to see me. So we'll have to fix that. Yeah. You should have come out that day. It was really good. Maybe they had the top, top people out there, maybe, why weren't you there? I don't know. We'll figure that out one day. Let me tell you, it was extremely healthy. That was – I really enjoyed that. I had a... That's great. ...back problem and I had to leave, but I would love to stay another hour to have that interactions  (00:49:35). That's fantastic. I'm glad you were here. Absolutely, absolutely. Curious what you're thinking on share buybacks from here. You said you might build capital. I think you mentioned $100 million, $200 million. Are you thinking if you don't have the loan growth here in the near term that you might just hold the capital and not do more buyback activity here in the near term? No, we'll continue to buy back. We'll continue to be in the market buying stock. We may cut back on it somewhat, the way at the amounts we've been buying. We think it may be prudent to store $150 million to $200 million. The worst thing could happen to us if we do that, we've got a sub-debt. It's due in 30 months... Yeah. March of 2022. March of 2022. We could pay way down the sub-debt. Somehow, they've never convinced me how that works. They count it as capital and it shows up on the balance sheet as debt so I don't understand how that works. I don't like debt. So we're thinking that that might be – we might use the cash to pay down on that. We're kind of splitting that. If it's $10 bill, we're kind of taking $5 in buying stock and about $5 is taken back. Blessed to have the kind of earnings multiple this company has where you have that kind of money to be able to do those things. I mean we pull all the handles and I don't know if you heard my presentation, but we've earned over $1 billion the last five years and we've given back to our shareholders over $500 million in stock buybacks and dividends. Yeah. So while growing all the – growing tangible book by 78% and our capital ratios at the same time, so it's a pretty good moneymaker. Yeah, absolutely. No, that's good. Is there a way to frame that up? I mean obviously, you bought back maybe – I think it was about $105 million in 2018. You've bought back looks like maybe about $75 million, $76 million this year so far. Is it $100 million a year of the... That's probably right. That's probably close. ...something like that? Okay. Yeah and probably good for you. Okay. That's probably good. Okay, okay. And then on the expense side, one other kind of follow-up there is, is this a good run rate in the quarter? Was there anything unusual in the salary line, in particular? Looked like it jumped a couple million bucks this quarter. One of that was the bonuses paid off for New York – for the payouts. Okay. So that would remain elevated as long as you continue to see payoffs but if payoffs decline, that number would also come down a bit? That's correct. But the way  process (00:52:19) is structured, that's part of this employee compensation and we don't have – the legacy doesn't have our structure that way. So that will be in the – if  the $120 million (00:52:31) worth of multi-families payoff in the fourth quarter, there'll be about $4 million worth of fees and there is no associated expense to that. Okay. Got you, very helpful, very helpful. Okay. And then maybe just the last thing around the NIM. If I'm hearing everything you guys have said correctly, looks like maybe loan yields are down a little bit from what you've booked already this quarter. So if loan growth does return a little bit, that would put more incremental pressure on your NIM than it would if maybe you just pulled back and stayed flat. Is that a correct way to think about it? (00:53:16-00:53:19) Loan growth returns that would put more pressure on our NIMs because we're riding at a lower rate. That's probably right. In theory, yes. Yes, I get it. In theory, that's probably right. In this rate environment, as we fit. Right, right. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, it's a push-pull between making more money or having better margins and better return. So that makes a lot of sense. Okay, guys. Perfect. Thank you, guys, for all the color. All right. Thank you. The next question will come from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead, sir. Hey, guys. Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian. Hey. Hey, Stephen, I guess maybe probably for you but just going back to the margin for a minute I guess. I guess if you get another rate cut or two, I guess just kind of from the core margin perspective, I mean, I guess, do you expect – I guess it sounds like you still expect some continued pressure there on the way down. But I guess do you expect the more rate cuts you get, I guess is your expectation at the beta, the deposit beta gets higher as you get I guess more benefit I guess or less impact? Yeah, potentially. Now, we talked this morning. I mean, I think you had such – on the deposit side, you had such a long period of zero rates and they ran up and gotten the 2% range. And everybody is excited to earn that. I mean I think it'll take some time as that appears that this may pull back down. I mean we're seeing – yeah, I'm finally seeing this past month on the deposit side CD volumes and those type things below the 2% range. So another rate cut or two is that people kind of go back to looking for security over yield. That may help from a reduction on the rate side. But it's still – there is still competitive environment on the deposit side too in all of our areas. You're seeing 2-plus percent adds out of competitors both here in Arkansas and in parts of Florida. So that's just something we're having to manage around. Yeah. Okay. The numbers that Brian gave, from a modeling standpoint, I think, are consistent with what we just saw this quarter from a core perspective if you strip out all the positive things we talked about. But I mean, again, as Johnny said, I think in the environment that we're in, you take credit for those and we're going to see those continue for foreseeable future. Okay. And just the – maybe I guess just in general, just kind of going to the efficiency ratio coming in, I mean it's a great level. I mean, if we're in this environment where revenues are being pressured, I mean is there a lot more you can do or do you see other opportunities on the expense side? How should we think about kind of the efficiency as you go into next year? I mean is it kind of flattish? Is it up a touch and does it drift up a little bit from where it's at in 2019 to 2020? Just kind of how you're thinking about that in general. I'd just use a 40%. I think 40% is fair. I mean, we've brought in lots of new people into the company over the last year or two and we've maintained that. I think most of that, any spending from personnel. I don't see it right now. Randy, you about see any additional major spending? Not anything major. There's still a few areas that need a person here or there and unless we have a lot of growth, I don't see that increasing. I think your 40% is right on the mark. Yeah. So, Townsell said if we got to 41%, she'd come back and take it back over. So... There's a memo going out in a minute. So, anyway, that was just a joke. I think it's pretty solid around 40%. It might take a little lower, but I think it's pretty solid. Okay. And maybe for Brian, just that FDIC credit, I guess that comes back in, what, mid next year? Is that how to think about that or it's just kind of ballpark when we should start putting that back in? No, the FDIC credit is a one-time event for us. Okay. So you saw the negative in the income statement. That's because we were able to reverse the accrual for  (00:57:50)... Yeah. ...for Q2 and not have to make really much of an accrual for Q3. So... Okay. Do you expect... ...it goes back to its normal run rate starting in Q4. Okay, perfect. Okay. Which  is a little run rate (00:58:06). That's all I have. Thanks, guys. Okay. All right. Thank you. The next question will come from Matt Olney with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hi, Matt. Hey. Most of my questions have been addressed, but on the M&A discussion, it sounds like you're seeing lots of books out there. I'm curious, do you think this is a buyer's market right now? I'm trying to get a better idea of what the pricing could be in an M&A transaction right now. I'd say it's much more of a buyer's market than we've seen in the last three or four years. We've actually had some reach out to us some time ago that didn't participate and they haven't done anything yet because of the higher price. Maybe things are coming back. We think they may be coming down a tick. As I've said to you, when I look at the universe and Home's trading at two times tangible, and we're running at 2% ROA and the guy who wants to do something is running at 1% ROA and he's trading at 1.8 or 1.9 times at tangible. So, it has been frustrating to us to see the weaker sisters. There's no disparity between the best operators and the poor operators to speak of really unless they stub their toe. And if they stub their toe, then the markets punish them right now. But I don't know that you're going to see a lot more. There may be some more problems with asset quality. You hadn't seen many this quarter thus far, have you? People having asset quality problems? So far it hasn't been as bad as it was last quarter. Okay. But you mentioned Florida as the market you're looking at and you've been buying in Florida for several years now, and I would think that you already know some of these banks pretty well. So, I'm curious, are some of these the same banks that you've danced with previously or are the books down there that you're seeing are these new faces that you're less familiar with? Actually, it's a little of both. It's a little of both. Okay. It's some that we danced with and didn't do anything, and then some that – actually, the last book we looked at was four banks this week, right? And I'm trying to think of the names. Two we had danced around with and two we had not. Got it. So, about half and half. But I think the press is going to get – I don't know why everybody's in a hurry all of a sudden. Maybe it's the loan demand and rates and the difficulty of managing $15 billion or $20 billion assets in this kind of roller-coaster economy. Maybe they're just joining the house. Maybe they think Elizabeth Warren's going to win. I don't know what happened, but something is stirring this out there that, when you ask them why they're thinking about selling, I don't know that you always get the right answer. Got it. And then just switching gears, more of a modeling question. On the tax line item, you had some unusual movements this quarter. Any change to your expectations of that effective tax rate being around 24%? Yeah, it should change a little bit. Our marginal rate had been 26.135%, but with the Florida being a little bit lower, we have a quite a bit of real estate down there in Florida, probably the marginal rates now going to go to 25.819%. We had been running an effective tax rate of about 24.1%. I'd love for that to be about 300 basis points lower down to about 23.8%. Got it. And then... That's what I would have told you probably. I think he did it right. I think he told you right there. And Brian, what about on the purchase accounting accretion, little bit of a step down the third quarter. What's the outlook from here going into fourth quarter and then the CECL treatment for that going into 2020? Okay. This last quarter, we had a $8.5 million of accretion and $6.2 million of that came from what I'll call just normal running off the normal accretion. And then we had $2.2 million of payoff accretion. What I've been witnessing is that about – over the last year and half is that it seems to be tripping down a little over $0.5 million per quarter on average. I would not be surprised to see for total accretion be below $8 million for Q4, maybe around $7.8 million, $7.9 million for accretion. As far as the change once CECL comes in, it really shouldn't change much because everything that we have that's out there that is accreting continues to accrete. The little bit of change we might have is that we've had some non-accretable discounts that we've decided that were no longer needed. We've been able to move those over to accretable and that piece of the puzzle will stop in 2020, but we still have $78.4 million of accretable discounts on our books as of September 30. Got it. And then on the BOLI contract that was surrendered, what's the ongoing impact of that? Is that a few hundred thousand dollars in fee income that you were benefiting from each quarter that will now stop? Obviously, in our non-interest income, we had increase in cash value of life insurance and it was $714,000 for this quarter. $135,000 of that was related to the BOLI that we cashed in for this quarter. That will not be reoccurring in Q4 or Q1 or any time in the future after that. We get our BOLI cash six months after surrender and we surrendered it late in September. So we actually think we should see a pickup there. I mean, we were yielding like 1.16% or something... 1.14%. 1.14%. I mean  we'd spin on our head (01:04:24) and do better than that. So that's why we called it there. Okay. Okay, guys. Good report. Thanks for your help. You bet. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Allison for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thanks, Chuck. I guess we'll see you in 90 days. We'll continue doing what we've done in the past of buying back stock and growing the tangible book value of the company, continue paying a strong dividend and growing capital at the same time. So I would say that we're kind of becoming like, what is it? The  (01:05:03). We've never had to just let them go. We're just reliable. So I think Home's becoming the reliable company. So we continue to hit good numbers and perform properly in these all different kinds of markets and we look forward to talking to you all again in 90 days and thanks for your support. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Thanks to all for joining us today and welcome to our second conference call as the newly rebranded Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation. We remain pleased that our change in name, signage and trading symbol has been uneventful and, in fact, we've received a surprising number of compliments about it. I'd like to express my gratitude to our marketing team for leading this very successful effort. I'd like to point out this month marks my three-year anniversary of having joined the company. What a difference I see three years in and what an exciting transformation we have experienced and continue to experience. Our team checked off the boxes on the prior three-year strategic plan and recently approved a new one that I'll comment on later in my remarks. The current challenges we face in the interest rate environment notwithstanding, I've never been more optimistic, confident and enthusiastic about the future of the company than now. Turning to current events, Atlantic Union followed its good first half of the year with a solid third quarter. You will recall our stating in prior comments that results would be noisy for the first three quarters of the year as we wind up the Access National Bank integration, rebranding and a few other undertakings and that has certainly proven to be the case. As you can see in the earnings release, we did have a number of onetime items in the third quarter and a charge off of a long-term land development work out, all of which impacted our operating profitability metrics from the prior quarter. For purposes of clarity, Rob Gorman will walk you through nonrecurring items in detail during his portion of the comments, but for now I'll hit the highlights of the quarter. To start, we delivered strong deposit growth, while loan growth was seasonally slow in the third quarter. Continue to build out the leadership team with the selection of a seasoned wealth management leader, we will have more detail about this hire in an upcoming official announcement. We also hired another seasoned leader, Alison Holt-Fuller, into a new role as Head of Product Management. Both have exemplary backgrounds and are important additions to the company's leadership. We rolled out our new three-year strategic plan to our teammates and we consolidated four branches. As for operating metrics for the quarter, our operating return on tangible common equity was 15.64% which is a 94-basis point decrease from the second quarter. Operating return on assets was 1.29%, down 6 basis points from the last quarter, and operating efficiency ratio was 55.12% which is a 266 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Since last fall, we've communicated our financial targets on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2019 of an operating ROTCE between 16% and 18%, and operating ROA between 1.4% and 1.6%, and an operating efficiency ratio at 50% or below. Clearly, we're facing headwinds from the current rate environment. At the beginning of the year, we expected there would be Fed fund increases in 2019 and a steepening yield curve. The rate environment has shown to be worse than our expectations, and there has been a sustained inversion of the yield curve which continues to negatively impact our net interest margin. Nevertheless, based on what we know today, we expect to be within the targeted ROTCE range in the fourth quarter of 2019 on an annualized basis, and our efficiency ratio should be near the 50% target for the fourth quarter as well. Achieving our ROA target, however, now looks like a 2021 event, given our current interest rate modeling. Again, Rob will elaborate on this in his section. Loan growth was 3% annualized for the quarter point-to-point, while average loans grew 5%. Q3 is predictably a seasonally slow loan growth quarter for us further dampened by seasonal pay downs among our government contracting clients due to the federal government's September 30 fiscal year-end. We also saw the persistent trend of CRE pay downs remain at elevated levels. C&I line utilization during the quarter remains stable, while total commitments ticked up from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the Access acquisition closed on February 1, 2019. On a pro forma basis, as if the Access balances were included for the full year, our year-to-date annualized loan growth is approximately 5% point-to-point, slightly below year-to-date expectations. Our loan pipelines are well-balanced. They remain strong and are higher than at this point last year. Based on everything we know at this time, we expect full-year 2019 loan growth to be around 6%. We do think we could outperform this end of third quarter forecast just as we did at this time last year, especially given our 14% annualized loan growth in last year's fourth quarter and a disruption of the pending BB&T-SunTrust merger. However, we think it best to update our expectations based on where we are currently and then we'll see what happens. Our deposit growth was a bright spot for the quarter, coming in strong at about 17% annualized. In the second quarter, we noted that we had experienced seasonal reductions in deposits from some larger relationships that we expected to return in the second half of the year and they did. Encouragingly, though, our rebounded deposit growth was broadly based. Year-to-date, deposit growth of approximately 9% point-to-point is at the higher end of our upper-single-digit-growth guidance. Given the current strength, we continue to believe we'll be in our guidance range of high-single-digit deposit growth for the year, although the deposit ratio was around 94% at quarter-end, which is slightly below our 95% target and that's a good place to be. Turning to credit. Our credit quality remains solid. The economy and our footprint is steady. Unemployment in Virginia ticked down to 2.8%, and we still do not see any evidence of systemic changes to our credit environment. Charge-offs did increase to 25 basis points annualized from 14 basis points in the prior quarter, totaling 18 basis points year-to-date. The increase was primarily from one long running land development work out that incurred a $3.1 million charge-off during the quarter, accounting for about 40% of total charge-offs. This does not reflect any change in our credit environment that was rather unique to the borrower whose personal circumstances caused him to negotiate an orderly sell of the property to another developer versus continue to build it out as he's been doing for a very long time. From our standpoint, we decided the best course of action was agree to the sale in bulk, eliminate the exposure, be done with it versus take it into OREO and attempt a better outcome. The transaction is expected to close in November. On the other hand, we also had an outsized loan recovery of $9.3 million from the Xenith-acquired portfolio not reflected in net charge-offs as the loan was charged off prior to acquisition and therefore was accounted for under noninterest income. As we've seen in prior quarters, a big part of charge-offs, 40% in the third quarter, came from a third-party consumer loan portfolio. While it has served its intended purpose, this is not a strategic focus area and is being wound down over the next year. The remaining 20% of charge-offs for the quarter were well distributed among a handful of smaller borrowers and we noted nothing out of the ordinary with them. As evidenced by this quarter, charge-offs are typically lumpy, quarter-to-quarter, but we otherwise expect full year 2019 to look about like the past few years in terms of credit quality barring some unexpected change in the macroeconomic environment. As I've said for nearly three years, I continue to believe that problem-asset levels at Atlantic Union and across the industry remain below the long-term trend line. Eventually, we are going to see a return to more normalized credit losses but we can't tell you when to expect that as we're not yet seeing any evidence of a systemic downturn. Moving away from quarterly results and looking ahead, as I mentioned earlier, we rolled out a new three-year strategic plan to our teammates during the quarter. Our plan is in keeping with how we like to operate Atlantic Union Bank, which is maintain forward progress, press our advantage where we can, and do what we say we're going to do. The new plan will deliver on four overarching objectives that, we believe, are essential to our future success. First, meet the changing needs of our customers. We must remain nimble and respond to the rapidly evolving business environment. We note, with caution, any number of formerly well-regarded businesses who took their eye off of their customers, failed to respond to a changing environment, and found themselves obsolete. We want to avoid that outcome. Second, optimize, digitize and automate processes. Our business processes need to be optimized, digitized and automated in order to improve efficiency, responsiveness, and get things right every single time. This is a multi-year undertaking, but the work is underway now. Third, demonstrate organic growth. We've demonstrated we're a successful acquirer and integrator, but less obvious is the organic growth we've also achieved. We believe we have the platform, scale, markets and capabilities to demonstrate we can meet our objectives through organic growth. This doesn't mean we would not consider acquisitions over the next three years but, for the time being, the best investment for Atlantic Union Bank is Atlantic Union Bank itself. We have an ambitious initiatives agenda inside the company, and we need time without M&A distraction to focus and best position ourselves for growth and future success. And last but not least, at every turn, keep getting better. We have a great opportunity to build the premier Mid-Atlantic regional bank, and we can't do that on a status-quo footing. As the saying goes, the road to success is always under construction. I love the keep-getting-better mantra and I think that it fits nicely with our can-do attitude and it defines who we have become and what we stand for. For those who know us and know our story, these objectives are a logical progression of what we've been working on for some time. Not surprisingly, our roadmap to achieving these outcomes is very familiar. There are priorities which remain unchanged day one and I'll give you a few updates on our priorities. First, diversify loan portfolio and revenue streams. We continue to make progress on our commercial banking effort and the commercial loan categories of C&I and owner-occupied real estate are now one-third of our loan balances. To complement this effort, we are standing up an equipment finance team to close a competitive gap in our commercial offerings. This is something we've been exploring for about a year and we first signaled at our Investor Day presentation last fall. The team is based in Atlanta, they worked together for some time with a great track record, and they have backgrounds in the super regional and large national banks. We'll leverage this new capability to take maximum advantage of opportunities across our Mid-Atlantic footprint in addition to their independent originations. While it will take a few quarters for the team to get up to speed, we're excited to offer secured equipment finance to include leasing as a specialized commercial and industrial offering for our clients. They generally focus on equipment transaction sizes of $1 million and up. Next, grow core funding. As I mentioned earlier, our loan-to-deposit ratio is currently about 94%. We continue to believe we have opportunities to grow our deposit base and deepen our market share. In the latest FDIC depository market share data, Atlantic Union became, what we believe to be the first Virginia bank ever to overtake one of the big four bank competitors in the Richmond MSA, eclipsing BB&T to take the number four position. The coming Truist merger will solidify this position as SunTrust is eliminated, managing the higher levels of performance. As mentioned, we're maintaining our top tier financial metric targets and will aim to stay in the top quartile of our peers by these measures. Next, strengthen digital capabilities. We've already implemented Zelle and nCino this year which we view as table stakes technology improvements for consumer and commercial clients. On the Middleburg Financial or wealth management side, we're in the early stages of adopting a new comprehensive wealth management platform which will improve the client experience, while making us more efficient and scalable. We're also working on a new digital account opening solution and have already simplified the mobile banking enrollment process by eliminating repetitive data entry. Next, to make banking easier, we launched an improved digital service functionality for consumer customers, making it easier to update basic personal financial information. In the fourth quarter, we're piloting a project to have temporary instant debit card issuing in our branches. This will not only make banking easier, but it will give customers everything they need to immediately start using our services, once opened. Last, we're replacing our priority of integrate Access National Bank, which we'll check off at year-end, with a new priority, and that's capitalize on strategic opportunities. Who knows what the future holds, but as we stated in our strategy, we must be nimble and ready to react to the changing marketplace. The greatest market opportunity we're going to see at Atlantic Union Bank over the next few years is likely the pending combination of BB&T and SunTrust, so I'll give a few updates on where we stand with that. Year-to-date, we've hired 29 people from these companies in a variety of roles. Anecdotally, we're seeing more traction in the marketplace for Atlantic Union as the alternative bank of choice. It's the not-too-large, not-too-small home team alternative, we believe we're well-positioned to take advantage of this disruption and are not simply waiting for this to come to us. We have an organized project team leading a multifaceted strategy focused on maximizing this opportunity. The team analyzed their branch network, as well as the BB&T and SunTrust branch network to identify, categorize and prioritize opportunities for Atlantic Union. We're expecting considerable Truist branch closures outside of the required divestitures in our Virginia trade areas and we want to be ready for the coming disruption. We are accelerating some investment in projects we had slated for 2020, in to this year to close competitive gaps and capitalize on what we firmly believe will be a multiyear disruption at the single largest market share competitor operating in Virginia. I realize this has been a lengthy update, but I hope it provides insight into how we think and what we've been up to. In summary, Atlantic Union had another solid quarter. We're making steady progress against our strategic priorities and are positioned to continue to improve our already good financial performance, despite the interest rate environment headwinds. We're pleased with the favorable market reception to our new Atlantic Union Bank brand. I remain highly confident in what the future holds for us and the potential we have to deliver long-term sustainable performance for our customers, communities, teammates and shareholders. And I'll close as I usually do by reiterating that Atlantic Union is a uniquely valuable franchise, it's dense and it's compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in our region. We've assembled the right scale, the right markets and the right team to deliver high performance and a franchise that can no longer be replicated in Virginia. We have incremental growth opportunities in our North Carolina and Maryland operations, and what we believe will be a multiyear disruption with two of our largest competitors causing us to believe we have everything we need to accomplish our objectives organically at the present time. I'll now turn the call over to Rob to cover the financial results for the quarter. Rob? Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'd now like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of Atlantic Union's financial results for the third quarter. Please note that, for the most part, my commentary will focus on Atlantic Union's third quarter financial results on a non-GAAP operating basis which excludes $1.9 million in after-tax merger-related costs and $895,000 in after-tax rebranding-related costs. For clarity, I will specify which financial metrics are on the reported versus non-GAAP operating basis. In addition, where applicable, I will make reference to the company's financial results that are further adjusted for material, strategic and atypical items which impacted the current quarter, including actions taken to reposition the balance sheet for declining interest rates. These items include the following: the company received approximately $9.3 million in life insurance proceeds during the quarter related to a Xenith-acquired loan that had been charged off prior to the company's acquisition of Xenith, which was recorded in other noninterest income. The company sold approximately $75 million of securities and recorded a gain on the sale of investments of approximately $7.1 million during the quarter. The company also paid off $140 million in long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances and terminated related cash flow hedges, which resulted in debt extinguishment losses of approximately $16.4 million recorded in noninterest expense. The effective cost of these advances, including the hedge, was 5.8%. So, by repaying these high-cost fixed rate advances, we were able to improve the go-forward net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points and increase annual earnings by about $0.04 per share. In the third quarter, reported net income was $53.2 million and earnings per share was $0.65, up approximately $4.5 million or $0.06 from the second quarter. The reported return on equity was 8.35%, the reported return on assets was $1.23%, and the reported efficiency ratio was 60.47%. On a non-GAAP operating basis which, as noted, excludes $2.8 million in after-tax merger-related and rebranding-related costs, consolidated net earnings for the second quarter were $56.1 million or $0.69 per share, down from $57.1 million or $0.70 per share in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP operating return on tangible common equity was 15.64% in the third quarter and was 16.18% on a year-to-date basis. The non-GAAP operating return on assets was 1.29% in the third quarter and was one 1.32% on a year-to-date basis. The non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio was 55.12% in the third quarter and was 53.92% on a year-to-date basis. Of note, the third quarter operating efficiency ratio would have been approximately 430 basis points lower if adjusted for the strategic and atypical items referenced above. As John mentioned, we expect improvements to the operating financial metrics in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance relative to our peers. Since last fall, we have been targeting the following operating financial metrics: an operating return on tangible common equity within a range of 16% to 18%, an operating return on assets in the range of 1.4% to 1.6%, and an operating efficiency ratio of 50% or lower. We expect to be in the targeted range for return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter of 2019 and on a full-year basis in 2020. Due to the current low rate environment and expectations of further reductions in the Fed funds rate, we continue to project additional net interest margin compression in the next several quarters, which will delay achievement of the low end of the return on assets targeted range until 2021. In addition, due to additional net interest margin compression and its impact on net interest income, we are now projecting that the operating efficiency ratio will be range-bound between 50% and 52% over the medium term. Now turning to the major components of the income statement, tax equivalent net interest income was $139.4 million which is down $2.1 million from the second quarter primarily due to lower levels of loan-related accretion income which declined by $2.7 million from the prior quarter. Net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments for loans, time deposits and long-term debt added 13 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter which was down from the second quarter's 20 basis point impact, again primarily due to the reduced levels of loan-related accretion income. The current quarter's tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.64%, which is a decline of 14 basis points from the prior quarter. The decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin was principally due to a 19-basis-point decrease in the yield on earning assets partially offset by a 5-basis-point decline in the cost of funds. The 19-basis-point decrease in the quarter-to-quarter earning asset yield was primarily driven by a 21-basis-point decline in the loan portfolio yield. The 21-basis-point quarterly decline on the loan yield was driven by 10 basis points impact from the lower loan accretion income and lower loan yields of 11 basis points, resulting from the impact of declines in market interest rates during the quarter, notably reductions in the one month LIBOR rate and the prime rate. The quarterly 5-basis-point decrease in the cost of funds to 109 basis points was primarily driven by a 32-basis-point decline in wholesale borrowing costs and favorable changes in the overall funding mix between quarters, partially offset by higher deposit costs which increased 2 basis points from the second quarter to 95 basis points. The material reduction in wholesale borrowing costs and the overall reduction in the cost of funds during the quarter resulted in part from the various management actions taken to reposition the balance sheet for declining interest rates that were executed in Q2 and Q3, including the repayment of high-cost federal home loan bank advance, as noted earlier. The provision for loan losses for the third quarter was $9.1 million or 29 basis points on an annualized basis, an increase of $3.2 million or 9 basis points from the second quarter. The increase in loan loss provision from the previous quarter was primarily driven by higher levels of net charge-offs and loan growth. For the third quarter of 2019, net charge-offs were $7.7 million or 25 basis points on an annualized basis, as compared to $4.3 million or 14 basis points in the prior quarter. As in previous quarters, a significant amount of the net charge-offs came from non-relationship third-party consumer loans which are in run-off mode. In addition, as John mentioned, we also charged off $3.1 million during the quarter related to a long-running land development workout loan. On a year-to-date basis, September 30th net charge-offs were $16.3 million or 18 basis points. Noninterest income increased $17.5 million to $48.1 million for the third quarter from $30.6 million in the prior quarter. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by life insurance proceeds of approximately $9.3 million related to the Xenith-acquired loan that had been charged off prior to the acquisition of Xenith, as well as a gain of approximately $7.1 million due to the sale of investment securities during the quarter. In addition, loan-related interest rate swap income increased $1.8 million due to increased transaction volumes resulting from the flat yield curve. And mortgage banking income increased approximately $600,000 from the prior quarter due to increased levels of refinanced loan volumes, driven by the low mortgage interest rate environment. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.1 million decline in debit card interchange income as a result of complying with the Durbin Amendment which was effective for the company starting on July 1st of this year. Excluding merger-related cost and rebranding-related costs in both the second and third quarters of 2019, operating noninterest expense increased $13 million or 14.3% to $108.1 million when compared to the prior quarter. The increase in operating noninterest expense was primarily due to the $16.4 million debt extinguishment loss previously discussed. Factoring out this loss, the operating noninterest expense would have been $91.7 million which was down $3.5 million from the prior quarter. In addition, third quarter operating noninterest expense included approximately $309,000 in OREO valuation adjustments, driven by updated appraisals received during the quarter; $275,000 in recruiting costs related to the new equipment finance team; and $1 million in support of a community development initiative. These expenses were offset by an FDIC small bank assessment premium expense credit of approximately $2.4 million that the company qualified for as the FDIC deposit insurance fund, or DIF reserve ratio, exceeded 1.38% in the second quarter, which triggered the credit. We also expect to receive $1.3 million in additional FDIC credits in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we closed four branches in September that will result in an annual run rate expense savings of approximately $1.2 million, beginning in the fourth quarter. In addition, I'm pleased to note that we achieved our $25 million Access-related merger cost savings target on a run-rate basis at the end of the third quarter. Please note that, we expect to incur approximately $1 million more in merger costs and an additional $1 million in rebranding costs in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.8% compared to 16% in the second quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate, as compared to the previous quarter, was primarily due to the lower proportion of tax-exempt income to pre-tax income. For the full-year, we still expect an effective tax rate in the range of 16% to 16.5%. Now turning to the balance sheet; period end total deposits stood at $17.4 billion at September 30th which was an increase of $282 million from June 30. At quarter end, loans held for investment were $12.3 billion, an increase of $86 million or approximately 3% on an annualized basis. On a pro forma basis as if the Access acquisition had closed on January 1st instead of February 1st, year-to-date loan balances grew approximately 5% on an annualized basis through September 30th. Looking forward, as John mentioned, we now project loan growth of approximately 6% for the full-year of 2019. At September 30th, total deposits stood at $13 billion which is an increase of $529 million or approximately 17% from the June 30th levels. On a pro forma basis, as if the Access acquisition had closed on January 1st instead of February 1st, deposit balances increased approximately 9% annualized in the first nine months of the year. Deposit balance growth was driven by increases in demand deposits, money market and time deposit balances, partially offset by declines in interest checking account balances. Turning to credit quality; nonperforming assets totaled $36.4 million or 30 basis points as a percentage of total loans, an increase of $2.4 million or 2 basis points from the second quarter level. The increase in NPAs was primarily driven by the addition of the fully collateralized remaining loan balance related to the long-running land development workout loan that was previously discussed. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.4 million from June 30th to $43.8 million, primarily due to loan growth during the quarter. The allowance as a percentage of the total loan portfolio ticked up 1 basis point to 36 basis points at quarter end. And now I'd like to provide our thoughts on how the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss model or CECL will impact Atlantic Union. As you may know, effective January 1st, 2020, CECL will become the new accounting standard requiring companies to reserve for projected lifetime loan losses at loan origination date, replacing the current incurred loss impairment accounting methodology that requires companies to report provisions for loan losses only when a loss becomes probable. Under CECL, lifetime expected credit losses will be determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the loan portfolios. Since 2016, the company has had a company-wide cross functional governance structure in place to oversee the implementation of the CECL standard and ensure we are ready to adopt the CECL standard on the effective date. Upon adoption of this standard, assuming that economic outlook and portfolio characteristics are consistent with recent periods, the company estimates that the allowance for credit losses will increase to within a range of $90 million to $100 million or approximately double the allowance for loan loss reserve levels as of September 30th under the current incurred loss methodology. The expected increase is primarily driven by the company's acquired loan portfolio and the consumer loan portfolio due to the portfolio's longer average life. Ultimately, the increase to the allowance for credit losses will depend on the characteristics and mix of the company's loan and securities portfolios, macroeconomic conditions and economic forecasts model, final validation of CECL models and methodologies and other management judgments at the time of adoption on January 1st, 2020. From a shareholder stewardship and capital management perspective, we are committed to managing our capital resources prudently as the deployment of capital for the enhancement of long-term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities. As such, during the third quarter of 2019, the company declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, an increase of $0.02 per share or 8.7% compared to the prior quarter's dividend level. In addition during the quarter, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $150 million of the company's common stock through June 30th of 2021, in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions. As of October 16th, we have repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average price of $36.46. The total remaining authorization to purchase shares is approximately $100 million at this time. So, to summarize, while the quarter was quite noisy again, Atlantic Union delivered solid financial results in the third quarter, despite the headwinds of the current interest rate environment, and the company continues to make progress toward its strategic growth priorities. Finally, please note that we remain focused on leveraging the Atlantic Union franchise to generate sustainable profitable growth and remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance and building long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill to open it up for questions from our analysts. Here you go, Bill. Thank you, Rob. And, Tiffany, we're ready for our first caller, please. Your first question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor. Your line is open. Good morning, Catherine. Thanks. Good morning. I want to start first with the margin. Rob, I wondered if you could give us some update on what your outlook is for the margin. You've previously guided for about 4 to 5 bps... Yes. ...per quarter compression, but you're now making changes to the balance sheet, so just kind of update your thoughts there. Yeah. So, just to give you some context of our projections going forward, we are currently assuming that we'll get another three cuts in the Fed funds rate, one in October, another in December and then one in the third quarter of 2020. In terms of that modeling, what we are expecting to see is the core margin for the fourth quarter, we're looking at continued compression of probably 3 to 4 basis points. And then, quarterly through 2020, we're looking at about 4 to 5 basis points consistent with what we said before on a quarterly basis. So, that's our current outlook, really hasn't changed much. As you know, we did have a bit more compression this quarter, which was primarily driven by a higher – or actually lower levels of one-month LIBOR. The drop was – in terms of our projection, the drop was more than we had originally projected, so that added 2 basis points of compression versus our previous guidance. Got it. Okay. So, another 3 to 4 bps compression in the fourth quarter and then 4 to 5 bps per quarter through 2020 assuming three more cuts? Yes, that's correct. Okay. So, we're looking at, kind of, stabilizing the margin coming out of next year probably in the 3.30%, 3.35% range. Got it. Okay. And then under that scenario, how in 2021 would we get to a 1.4% ROA? We're, kind of, coming out of 2020 with an even 3.35% margin. Yes. So, we mentioned before that 1.4% return on assets is probably the most difficult to achieve. We're going to continue to evaluate that based on our – we're going through our budget process for 2020 right now and forecasting through 2021. We are going to reevaluate that guidance going forward and probably talk a bit more about that in our fourth quarter call. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. And so, then on the growth, you're now forecasting for growth to be about 6% for this year, how should we think about growth for next year? Is it fair to assume that 2020 growth should be higher than that 6% just given some of the Truist opportunities that you have? Yes, Catherine. This is John. We would say, expect somewhere in the high-single-digit range. I wouldn't be projecting 9%. But 7%, 8%, 9% somewhere within that band should be doable based on the various initiatives that we have underway and based on market conditions based on what we know right now. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Catherine. And, Tiffany, we're ready for our next caller, please. Your next question comes from the line of Casey Whitman. Your line is open. Hi, Casey. Good morning. Morning. Just a question on expenses. So, if I take out that FDIC assessment credit, core expenses this quarter may be running around $94 million. Last quarter, I think you were guiding to expenses coming down to, like, the $90 million, $91 million range. Do you think that's still achievable given all the investments and hires you've made? And is there anything other than – I think you mentioned, like, $1.2 million in branch closer savings to come out, or do you think that's really – just the run rate is a little higher given the investments, including the equipment finance division? Yeah. Thanks, Casey. It's Rob. I calculate that we have a $91.7 million core run rate, if you will, versus the $94 million you mentioned. As we said, we had some unusual items that were offset by that credit. So, I calculate about $91.7 million. Going forward, we're looking at the $90 million to $91 million on a run-rate basis in the fourth quarter, and that excludes the rebranding cost of $1 million, potential conversion merger costs of $1 million. And as we've said before, we're looking to accelerate some of our spending related to the opportunity from the Truist disruption, and that's about $1 million. So, if you take all that together, we're looking at $90 million to $91 million for Q4. And then going forward, what we'll be projecting is probably a 4% to 4.5% growth rate off of that run rate. Got it. So the recruiting cost and the OREO valuation adjustments and the community development initiative, those kind of items we would assume wouldn't necessarily – wouldn't come back, is that what you're saying? Exactly. That's the way I'm looking at it as well. Yes. In the FDIC assessment credit; is your expectation that you would get that for maybe one more quarter? Yes. So the total credit we're getting related to that was $3.8 million. Our total premium assessment this quarter was $2.4 million, so basically it was zeroed out and we'll apply the remainder which is about $1.3 million to our assessment for the fourth quarter. So, we're expecting $1.3 million of credit coming through in the fourth quarter. Got it. All right. Then, I'll just ask I guess a bigger picture, I mean, just on M&A. It sounds like still very focused on the organic growth here. But I guess any update to your general thoughts on the whole bank M&As, and kind of the timeline that you might start reengaging more in those conversations? Hi, Casey. This is John. It's really – it's difficult to imagine that we would want to do anything next year. That doesn't mean that we – well, quite candidly, we are always having conversations. There are always conversations going on. There's literally a queue. We could do one tomorrow if we wanted to, but we don't. We have more important things to do right now. So I think my big concern is that, if we take on another M&A deal, it will cause us to kick the can down the road on what we believe are actually far more strategically important opportunities. So we really need time to knock some of these things out. You heard me list out some of the initiatives that are on the table. Particularly with the new leadership, we have a consumer digital strategy recognizing that the largest opportunity we have is, in fact, this SunTrust-BB&T combination. So, if anything changes in terms of our intentionality, we're going to tell you. We would begin to signal it. It's just very difficult to imagine that we would want to try to get anything done next year, again, which doesn't mean we couldn't be having conversations with someone over that period of time as we always do. So, that's about all I can say for now. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color. Thank you, Casey. Thanks Casey. And, Tiffany, we're ready for our next caller, please. Your next question comes from the line of Laurie Hunsicker. Your line is now open. Hi, Laurie. Good morning, Laurie. Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. I just wondered if we could jump over to credit. Certainly, your credit is looking good. But can you just refresh us, your, your third-party consumer, what is that book? And then, how much of that is Lending Club at this point? Yeah. So, it's a bit over $200 million total third-party, Laurie. About $140 million of that is the Lending Club book. That's been coming down. As you know, it's in runoff mode. It's been coming down by about $8 million to $9 million a month. The previous quarter it was $166 million. So, we're now down to $140 million. We expect that will continue to run off in the same fashion, going forward. Got it. Okay. And then, taking out the one credit, you said the majority of your charge-offs came from that book. So, if I'm doing the math right, it was around, I don't know, $4.7 million was then related to consumer? Yeah. Well, it wasn't the – the entire amount wasn't  (43:08) relatively smaller... Total for this quarter would have been consumer at 40%, would have been our one land development loan. And if you rewind the last couple of quarters, third-party consumer charge-offs have been running about literally two-thirds of total. Our charge-offs excluding third party have been running about 5 to 6 bps annualized which is too low as we've said consistently. Okay. And so I guess when should we expect to see this consumer book at zero? How are you thinking about that? You mean in terms of the third party? Yeah. We're expecting the majority of that to run off through the end of 2020, the Lending Club for the most part, so that should be running down through the next year or so. Okay. Great. And then just specifically around that or any guidance you can give, as we think about loan loss provisioning with CECL. Can you help us just think about this piece of it or more generally – and certainly appreciate the other color you gave? But if you can just help us think about what an ongoing loan loss provision would look like for you guys with this book? Yeah. So, Laurie, as you know we will be putting up an allowance for the acquired loan portfolio and also the purchase credit impaired or purchase credit deteriorated in CECL times. So we expect that the charge-off ratio will increase because we will now be charging off – loans that are in those books will be charged off against the allowance. So I'd expect that you would see 25 to 30 basis points, all things being equal. That's assuming we don't necessarily have lumpy commercial credit come through like we did this quarter. Okay. Great. And then just one last question on credit, I saw that you guys had an uptick in your CRE past due. Is there anything greater going on there or is there any color you can give us on that one? We made a reference in the release that $12 million of total past dues were actually current as of now. Of that $12 million, $8 million were actually what we refer to as administrative past dues so that would be the categories of commercial owner-occupied, non-owner-occupied. That simply means we had maturing credit facilities that were in process of renewal and those were not indicative of credit problems, they were simply indicative of getting the renewals through the system on time. We've mentioned before that we've implemented an end-to-end loan origination system. The downside of doing such a thing is that you run a J-curve. It actually takes longer to load new credit facilities and renewals into such a system initially. And for the bankers to get up to speed, it's slower until they gain experience with it, and then it becomes faster and so we are on the upside of that J-curve. So, we did have some slowdown in terms of processing renewals and that's what you're seeing, those were not credit issues. Okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then just over on expenses, I just want to make sure that I've got this right. You obviously had rebranding expenses here of $1.133 million, did that include any of the branch closure expenses or if not what were those and were they in the other line? Yeah. They did not include any branch closure costs in the third quarter. Actually, we had guided to, perhaps, expect another $200 million to $300 million in the third quarter for branch closures, but actually we came in quite a bit lower. It was about $50 million – ended up being about $55 million – $55,000 of branch closure costs. So, not material and that would have been in the other line item. Okay. Great. And then, just one last thing here on, sort of, as we think about one time within those merger costs and rebranding costs as we finish out this year 2019, are we pretty much done with those as we head into 2020 or how should we be thinking about that? Yeah that's exactly right, Laurie. This will be the final quarter of seeing both rebranding costs and merger costs. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Laurie, and thank you everyone for calling today. As a reminder, a replay of the call will be available on our Investor website investors.atlanticunionbank.com. Thank you and have a good day. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, and welcome to the F.N.B. Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Matt Lazzaro, Manager of Investor Relations. Mr. Lazzaro, please, go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. This conference call of F.N.B. Corporation and the reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission often contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our presentation materials and in our earnings release. Please refer to these non-GAAP and forward-looking statement disclosures contained in our earnings release, related presentation materials, and in our reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are available on our corporate website. A replay of this call will be available until October 24, and the webcast link will be posted to the About Us, Investor Relations & Shareholder Services section of our corporate website. I'll now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President and CEO. Good morning, and welcome to our earnings call. Joining me this morning are Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. Today, I'll provide highlights of FNB's exceptional third quarter results, which reflect record earnings of over $100 million and earnings per share of $0.31. I'll then discuss some exciting developments related to our long-term strategies that will enhance the FNB brand and support our future growth objectives. Gary will discuss asset quality, and Vince will review the financial results and provide an update for the projected CECL adoption impact. Third quarter EPS of $0.31 is another example of FNB's longstanding ability to execute our organic growth strategy as we continue to have success across broad geographies. This quarter's performance represents EPS growth of 7% on a linked quarter basis. Tangible book value per share increased 14% year-over-year to $7.33, as the pace we build capital continues and is consistent with our capital management strategy. Even with this higher capital position, return on tangible common equity was again a solid level of over 17% and the efficiency ratio equaled 54%. Looking across the footprint, spot loan growth was 9% on an annualized linked quarter basis, driven by continued commercial growth of 8% and consumer growth of 11%. This was led by very strong commercial production in FNB's Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington DC markets. In the Carolina region, Charlotte, Raleigh and Eastern North Carolina exceeded expectations this quarter, and are generating meaningful commercial activity this year. On the deposit side we had growth of over $1 billion in interest-bearing demand deposits, and 9% annualized growth in non-interest bearing deposits. As I mentioned earlier this year, growing low-cost deposits through household acquisition and deepening commercial relationships has been a focus of not only the management team but the entire organization, as the loan to deposit ratio further improved to 94% at September 30, with a more favorable funding mix. We continue to be laser-focused on generating non-interest bearing and transaction deposit growth given the current interest rate environment and the impact of margin pressure. Even when these balances have declined for the industry, we have continued to grow organically. We attribute the successful execution of our strategy that focuses on expansion into higher growth markets, along with infrastructure and technology investments. Looking at the 2019 FDIC market share data, we saw market share gains across most of our major metro regions. FNB is now ranked in the top 10 of retail deposit market share in seven MSAs across our footprint, and we've gained substantial share in Cleveland, Baltimore and the Piedmont Triad compared to 2018. Looking specifically at the Carolinas, we continue to drive organic growth with market share gains in Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte, Greensboro High Point and Winston-Salem. On an operating basis, noninterest income increased 15% year-over-year, with sizable contributions from mortgage banking, capital markets and wealth management. Capital markets and mortgage banking provided meaningful contributions to noninterest income at $8.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively. This represents a year-over-year increase of over 70% for capital markets and over 60% for mortgage banking. We are pleased with the growing contributions these business units have had over the past few quarters, with significant increases from our newer markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The efficiency ratio was again solid at 54%, as expense control remains a focal point, particularly given the current interest rate environment. We remain focused on our credit culture as evidenced by favorable performance in asset quality. For more details, I'll turn the call over to Gary to comment on our asset quality metrics. Gary? Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of positive credit results, with our loan portfolio continuing to perform in a stable and consistent manner, further improving our position on already solid levels. GAAP results were favorable for the quarter, marked by improved levels of delinquency that ended September down 4 basis points to stand at 91 bps. While NPLs and OREO also trended favorably during the quarter, down 3 bps to 52 basis points. Total net charge-offs remained flat at 11 basis points annualized, with an ending reserve position of 84 basis points. We are very pleased with these solid levels and the overall positioning of the portfolio as we remain at multi-year lows. I'll now walk you through the quarterly details for the originated and acquired portfolios. Turning first to the originated portfolio, delinquency ended the quarter flat at 66 basis points, with the long-term trend continuing to move in a favorable direction. NPLs and OREO further improved during the quarter to stand at a solid 56 basis points, a 5 bp reduction on a linked-quarter basis, which was driven by healthy OREO sales activity. Originated net charge-off levels for the third quarter remained consistent with Q2, ending September at a solid $5.3 million or 11 basis points annualized. On a year-to-date basis, net charge-offs totaled $15.4 million, also standing at 11 bps annualized. Provision expense for the quarter totaled $10.5 million and adequately covered net charge-offs and strong organic loan growth, bringing our ending reserve position to 95 basis points. Let's now review some results for the acquired portfolio, which stands at $3.2 billion at quarter-end. Our credit results remain consistent as this book continues to perform in line with our expectations. Contractual delinquency levels continue to trend favorably, decreasing $9 million on a linked quarter basis to stand at $78 million at the end of September. On a year-over-year basis, past dues continued to reduce, down by $51 million, representing a 40% reduction since September of 2018. The acquired reserve ended the quarter at $4.7 million and was up only slightly over the prior quarter. In closing, we had another solid quarter of positive credit results, marked by consistent and stable performance in the portfolio, which remains favorably positioned entering the final quarter of 2019. We will continue to execute our disciplined credit and lending decisioning processes as our banking teams seek out the highest quality lending opportunities to support our growth objectives and that fit our targeted risk profile and asset mix. This complements our risk management philosophy of proactively and attentively managing risk as we remain focused on strategically positioning the portfolio in this later-stage economy. Looking back on the year, we are very pleased with our performance and we look forward to finishing out the year in a solid position. I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks. Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our financial results for the third quarter, comment on our 2019 remaining outlook and provide an update on CECL. As noted on slide 3, third quarter operating EPS totaled $0.31. This represents a 7% increase to both the prior-year quarter and second quarter results. Our results for the period reflect a continued execution of our strategies as demonstrated by building our capital position with the TCE ratio of nearly 7.5%, leveraging our geographic expansion by generating consistent organic growth in loans and deposits and increasing the contributions from our fee-based businesses and sustaining favorable asset quality throughout the cycle. Let's start with the balance sheet for the quarter. Looking at the average quarterly balances on slide 6, total loans were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting sales of residential mortgage loans in both the second and third quarters. Looking forward, I think it's important to just focus on the spot growth compared to last year and where the balance sheet is positioned today. On a year-over-year basis, spot commercial loans and leases were up 7%, reflecting a 19% increase in C&I loans and 20% growth in commercial leases. In consumer lending, we saw an increase of 3% year-over-year, which is impacted by mortgage loan sales amounting to roughly $250 million. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, average deposits increased 4% annualized, primarily due to 8% growth in interest-bearing deposits and 9% growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a planned decrease in time deposits. As Vince noted, our deposit growth remains a focus for us, building on our commercial and consumer relationships as well as benefiting from seasonal growth in business deposit balances. Let's now look at noninterest income and expense on slides 8 and 9. Noninterest income reached a record $80 million, increasing 7% linked quarter, primarily due to significant growth in mortgage banking and insurance, and another near-record level for capital markets. Mortgage banking income increased $2.1 million, driven by normal seasonal increases and downward movement in interest rates as production volume increased 25% over last quarter. Insurance revenues increased $1.7 million with continued organic commercial growth and benefit from new business in the Mid-Atlantic and Carolina regions. Capital markets was again at very good levels, experiencing year-over-year growth of 71%, with solid contributions from elevated activity in interest rate swaps, international banking and syndications. Turning to slide 9, noninterest expense increased $2.5 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to a $3.2 million charge from a third quarter renewable investment tax credit transaction. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the quarter as a benefit to income taxes. On an operating basis, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased $0.7 million or 0.7% and occupancy and equipment expense was essentially flat. This reflects our efforts to manage expenses company-wide as well as benefits from our REDI program. Looking at revenue on slide 7, net interest income was flat compared to the second quarter as solid loan and deposit growth was mostly offset with lower asset yields on loans tied to one-month LIBOR, which declined 38 basis points from 240 basis points at the end of June compared to 202 basis points at the end of September. The resulting net interest margin was 3.17% compared to 3.20% in the second quarter, primarily due to the downward move in benchmark interest rates. While we are never pleased with net interest margin compression, we feel good about the relative performance given challenges presented by the volatile interest rate environment that existed throughout the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Overall, our bottom line EPS expectations are unchanged from January as we expect to mitigate net interest income pressure with better-than-expected noninterest income and provision expense. As you may recall, last quarter, we updated our guidance for net interest income to end up closer to flat on a year-over-year basis, which included a different rate forecast than what we experienced during the third quarter. The current Bloomberg consensus economists' forecast is calling for one additional Fed move in 2019, which has an impact in net interest income next quarter relative to our expectations in July. We would expect the margin to remain under pressure if current forecasted cuts materialize in 2019, and for net interest income to decline in the low-single-digits for the full-year of 2019. We're very pleased with the performance of our fee-based businesses, and current pipelines indicate a healthy fourth quarter. We now expect full-year noninterest income to grow in the mid-to-high-single-digits as mortgage banking and capital markets continue to exceed expectations from earlier this year. Given our asset quality trends, we now expect provision to be $50 million to $55 million, and our expense outlook is for expenses to be down year-over-year. The success in the key fee-based business segment highlight the importance of diversifying revenue sources beyond spread income. Lastly, we expect the full-year effective tax rate to be around 18%. Overall, we are very pleased with the financial performance this quarter, and believe we are on track to meet our bottom line guidance for the year even in a challenging interest rate environment. Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the expected impact of adopting CECL in 2020 as our cross-functional teams continue to make good progress on our implementation efforts. Beginning on slide 10, we show the estimated Day 1 increase to our allowance for credit losses of 25% to 35% for the originated loan portfolio. The related capital impacts are expected to range from 11 to 15 basis points of TCE, and 14 to 20 basis points of CET1 regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis. While originated and acquired loans are treated the same on Day 2, we felt that it was important to bifurcate the originated and acquired portfolio Day 1 impacts for this presentation, since Day 1 capital is only impacted by the originated portfolio. Turning to slide 11, the Day 1 CECL allowance on the acquired portfolio is estimated to be $65 million to $75 million. The CECL transition on the acquired portfolio results in a balance sheet gross-up of loans and allowance with no capital impact. Once the Day 1 CECL allowance is established on the acquired portfolio, the remaining credit and noncredit marks of $115 million to $135 million on these loans is accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the portfolio. The recognition of this accretion is similar to our current process, except that the remaining marks or discounts are maintained at the loan level as opposed to loan pools. The estimated increase to our allowance is driven by the fact that the allowances must cover expected credit losses over the estimated life of the loan portfolios, considering forecast of future economic conditions. These estimates are still subject to change based on continuing work on the models, macroeconomic conditions, and interest rates at the time of adoption, and the size, composition and credit quality of the loan portfolio. We will continue to evaluate and refine the results of our loss estimates until implementation in 2020. As you can see on the slides, the estimated Day 1 capital impact to our existing capital ratios is manageable and doesn't impact our capital management strategies. Next, Vince will give an update on some of our strategic initiatives in 2019. Thanks, Vince. Now, I'd like to focus on our progress regarding key strategic initiatives since our last call. In our consumer bank, we continue to focus on optimizing delivery channels. FNB will be deploying a new interactive website in 2020 to engage and better serve our customers. We are utilizing data analytics to improve our customers' experience and better align products and services with their needs. We are keeping pace with enhanced technology and expect to be a top tier provider of these services. Regarding our physical delivery channel, we continue to execute our established Ready program to optimize our branch network, which includes consolidation and expansion opportunities in higher growth markets. We recently announced plans to develop additional de novo locations in the D.C. Metro area; Northern Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina which will further enhance our retail strategy and support our corporate banking efforts in these attractive markets. Earlier this month, FNB announced $150 million share repurchase program that runs through the end of 2020. The board of directors unanimously approved this program to provide incremental value to our shareholders. This share repurchase program demonstrates our confidence in FNB's business model as well as our future expectations for continued increased capital generation. Our board's philosophy is to prudently return capital to shareholders. This is evident in our commitment to our dividend program which has returned over $1 billion over the past decade. Given the company's continued growth in earnings and higher capital levels, we have flexibility relative to our capital management plans with a dividend payout ratio under 40%. We have been able to lower our payout ratio by executing strategic acquisitions, enabling FNB to take out cost, gain scale, and grow revenue faster on an organic basis, all while maintaining an attractive dividend. In the past, we have emphasized our capital management strategy and we are very pleased with our progress and the opportunities this presents for our shareholders. Over the past three years, we have demonstrated our ability to drive organic growth and execute our proven business model as we have diversified geographically and expanded our products and services. This diversification will allow us to support our long-term growth objectives while maintaining our underwriting standards through the entire risk cycle. Given our improved capital position, we will evaluate the optimal methods to deploy capital that results in increased shareholder value, which may include dividends, buybacks, as well as other strategic investments that provide attractive returns. One key element necessary for FNB to continue to deliver performance for our shareholders is our commitment to our employees. I am pleased to share that FNB was also included for a ninth consecutive year on the 2019 Best Places to Work in Western Pennsylvania list presented by the Pittsburgh Business Times. This accolade builds on the company's recognition as a top workplace in Cleveland for the fifth consecutive year. The recognition from these publications is a testament to our culture and what we value most, our people. Before turning the call over to the operator, I want to reiterate how strong the results were this quarter. To summarize, net income to common shareholders surpassed $100 million for the first time in company history. Return on tangible common equity and the efficiency ratio were again peer leading as we continue to deliver these returns in a very challenging economic environment, something our team has proven time and again throughout past economic cycles. Tangible book value per share grew 14% year-over-year to $7.33, which is the highest level in recent decades. We are pleased with our progress and remain focused on growing tangible book value. Our dividend payout ratio reached 39% and our TCE ratio increased to 7.44%, and we've announced the $150 million buyback on top of returning over $1 billion in capital to the shareholders over the past decade. Non-interest income reached record levels of $80 million and increased 15% from last year. Our company continues to generate consistent organic growth in loans and deposits as evidenced by spot growth this quarter of 9% and 15%, respectively. All of these results benefit our shareholders, and we would like to recognize the hard work and dedication of our employees who make these results possible. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And this morning's first question comes from Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning. Morning, Frank. Frank. Vince, you talked about – you gave the updated guidance on NII. Just wondered if you would hazard an estimate on NIM compression here in the fourth quarter? I think in the third quarter, if you exclude purchase accounting accretion, then the core NIM, I'll call it the core NIM, was down 4 bps, is that a reasonable expectation for 4Q? Well. I would say, Frank, that there's a lot of moving parts to it, right? So, I think as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, what's the Fed going to do? That's a key driver. Right now, these – the guidance has baked into one move from the Fed. Our job, overall, is to manage the balance sheet in this interest rate environment. So, kind of core being down 4%, feel pretty good about it. We still have a lot of levers kind of in our pocket as we look at kind of protecting the net interest income. The mix of loan growth obviously has a big impact during this quarter. Commercial was 80% of the growth in the loans. That obviously helps on the positive side. The funding mix was also favorable. We had another quarter with strong DDA growth. Our success in doing that helps to protect the margin as you get into the fourth quarter, too. And then going the other way, right, one-month LIBOR continues to decrease methodically toward a forecasted Fed cut, potentially later this month. The current level is already down 15 basis points from the 2.04% it was at right after the last rate cut. So that affects our LIBOR-based loans which is about 33%, 34% of the total loan portfolio. So I think our ability to manage all those pieces, and then when you look at interest-bearing deposits in total, while it was up 2 basis points this quarter, it's clearly slowing. I expect that to turn the corner in the fourth quarter. It was up 11 basis points in the first quarter, 6 in the second, and then only up 2 in the third, and I expect that to come down a few, 3 or 5 basis points in the fourth quarter. So that's a positive going the other way. And then CD rates, just another element – I know this is a long answer, sorry, but CD rates, I expect to cross this quarter, so the new rate for the new CDs will be lower than kind of what's rolling off. So that's also a positive. And then we still continue to have a significant portion of our deposits that kind of had priced up as rates were going up and the betas on the way down had been slow. And it takes time to kind of manage through those, particularly on the business side of the deposits. So there's still a meaningful amount of deposits that we're actively working to kind of reprice those down commensurate with declines in rates. And if the Fed moves again, that creates more cover. So there's a lot of pieces there. I mean, there's still pressure on the margin, but I would expect it to be manageable in the fourth quarter given all these pieces. And the better we do repricing and growing DDAs, the less impact you'd have in the fourth quarter. Yeah. And I think, just to add, from a competitive perspective, I think that we're in a better position than we were in previous quarters in terms of managing our – the rate that we pay down. Others have not performed as well in terms of maintaining margin, so there's more pressure on our competitors, some of our larger competitors to rethink pricing. The other thing I'd like to just  put (00:28:12) back up for a second, from a total guidance perspective though, I made a comment in my remarks that we're still tracking from a bottom line perspective right where we guided in January. So while there's some pressure on the margin and net interest income, going the other way, we've revised our guidance up for fee income to mid to high single-digits given the success we've had the last couple of quarters, reduced our provision guidance to $50 million to $55 million from $55 million to $65 million given the credit quality we've been experiencing. So that's a positive, and we're still managing the expenses to be down year-over-year. So kind of from a bottom line perspective, we're right on top of the guidance we had at the beginning of the year, which is important. I got that. That's great. I appreciate all the color. And then just on the loan growth, you guys talked about the spot balances a couple of times. And the commercial spot balance growth does look very – looks quite normalized. I'm just trying to get a sense of – if I look at resi mortgage quarter-over-quarter balances in the period up $300 million, what is the normalized expectation there? I mean, just trying to get a sense if there's any noise in there. Well, it's the – the only item that needs to be that needs to be considered when you look at particularly the average balance change, we sold about $260 million in mortgage loans that a good piece of it was sold at the end of the second quarter. So, right around the end. So, that's going to impact the average balances. I think it's kind of tough to say that the growth rate in the mortgage business is going to continue at the levels that it is. I mean, obviously, we're in peak season in terms of origination. We're in an environment where we got some benefit from interest rates being lower in that business unit, which has helped offset – we've generated more fee income and it's helped offset the margin compression. But I think it's difficult to call how we're going to perform moving forward, because it's so lumpy. But I will tell you that, moving into the fourth quarter, our pipeline is significantly higher, significantly over the prior period last year. Okay. Great. And then... Yeah. Hey, Frank, if I could just follow up on that, just to give you just a couple of data points, so the $260 million that Vince mentioned, $111 million of that we sold in June, $100 million in August, $50 million in September, just so you kind of understand how it rolled through the numbers. And then, we had $120 million that was in-held for sale at the end of June. That was put back into held for investment at September 30. So that's kind of making the number a little bit higher for the quarter and then kind of gives you the go forward from there. But like Vince said, it's seasonally kind of lumpy kind of from a core business perspective. Got you. Okay. Great. And then, just finally, seems like you guys again have some pretty good traction now in the Carolinas. I'm sure right after the acquisition, now you get some pay downs and that hurts in that growth. But I wonder at this point, if you could – if you have what the net commercial growth you're seeing in the Carolinas region at this point. Yes. It's fairly consistent with the guidance that we've given for the whole company. I mean, we've said before, we don't expect them to produce outsized production in total. I think when you break down the pieces, we've had in excess of double-digit growth in Charlotte and we performed very well in Winston-Salem in the Piedmont region and now Raleigh is starting to come on As I mentioned on the last call, they had significant pipeline that's starting to pull through. So, they've had some very nice fundings. Still they've had a lot of pressure from real estate transactions paying off, because the Yadkin was more of a real estate lender, particularly in that market. But they're doing really well. And I'll tell you the teams down there, the people that we have are excellent. They've done a tremendous job and I think tremendous job transitioning from a smaller community bank to adopting the products and services and really driving a lot of that fee income growth that we speak about. We mentioned that early on when we bought the bank down there, we said, hey, we feel the biggest upside that's not modeled is the fee income and they're really delivering on many fronts. And the mortgage business is – our mortgage leader, Dave Green, has done a tremendous job rebuilding the teams down there. So the contributions coming out of the Carolinas has grown steadily. And I think, again that's – it's having some really good people that are committed and believe in the company and have been performing very well. So, we're very pleased with where we are. Great. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, Frank. Thanks, Frank. Thank you. And the next question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Jared. Hey. Just following up a little bit on the margin, I heard what you're saying, going into the end of the year. As we look at going into 2020 –  (00:33:48) but with an expectation that rates may continue to have downward pressure, should we expect to see any more significant, I guess, restructuring in how you're positioning the overall balance sheet or should we expect that you stay fairly consistent with how you run any additional rate pressure we see could continue to flow through the margin? Yeah. We'll just continue to actively manage the balance sheet, Jared, for kind of where we are and kind of what we see in front of us. For example, this quarter, where the first half of the year, we really had not been reinvesting cash flows at the securities portfolio. In the third quarter, we had some opportunities to put some money to work. So, we actually grew securities on a spot basis about $100 million from June 30 to September 30. So, I mean we're talking every day and every week at pricing committee as far as are there any tactics we should do? We funded a good portion of that securities with overnight borrowings in the short run to give us some protection from lower interest rates. So, that was some of the tactics that we did this quarter. And then, earlier in the year, we took advantage of very low rates and turned out some few hundred million dollars worth of term borrowings for – in the mid-1s for like two to five-year money. So, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see those opportunities to kind of tweak the balance sheet a little bit. As you know, we kind of manage conservatively and in kind of neutral from a philosophy standpoint. And I mentioned all the different levers that we have. So, I'm talking about for the quarter and our teams are going after DDAs. We're looking at both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet to take advantage of whatever we can to preserve the margin. We've been here before. So, it's the same management team. 10 years of this stuff, we become experts at finding rabbits. I think that the strategy that we've laid out is to continue to focus on noninterest income, growing noninterest income, it's to continue to focus everyone on the funding side, generating low-cost deposits. That means we're investing in technology to keep consumer depositors. We've been growing our consumer deposit base. We had good growth in the Southeast and in the Mid-Atlantic regions which was very helpful for us. We're very fortunate that we expanded into those markets when we did. So, that will help us as we move through this time. And then, we constantly look at the asset side of the balance sheet. We look at loan portfolios and contribution. We look at margin on origination. We look at the investment portfolio and we look for opportunities to enhance yield and we'll continue to do that. On the expense side, we've been very diligent over last two years and I think it's showing and we've been disciplined in managing expenses. And we still have to make investments in our company. So some of the expense saves from the branch consolidation went into repositioning in high-growth markets and investing in technology, but I think overall we've done a good job of holding costs down and we have other avenues we're pursuing to continue that into 2020. Yes. Actually that was going to be my second – my second question was, when you look at the expense saves coming out of branch optimization offset by the expansion into the D.C. markets and some of the other markets, is that going to be a net cost increase when you look at sort of the branch footprint combined with some of those tech initiatives or should they generally be a little more neutral to expenses? Well. I think Vince will be mad at me if I start giving guidance for 2020, but I think... (00:37:40). Let me give expense guidance, but our goal, Jared, is to try to fund that with those reductions. So, as we transition and move towards a more technology-oriented delivery channel, we have to come up with ways to reduce expense. We can't do both. So – and I think we've proven, if you look back over the last 12 months, we've made significant investments in the company in a number of areas. And we've proven that we're able to do that fairly effectively and we use relationships with vendors that we have who see the bigger picture and say, we want to grow with you who help us and we're very diligent  done adds to staff (00:38:20) and having efficient FTE deployment across the company. And that's going to continue into 2020, and we're going to do everything we can to benefit the shareholders as we move through this difficult interest rate environment. Okay. Thanks. And then finally just from me, on the capital management conversation, certainly, hearing what you're saying that the dividend, the buyback, should we think that you're leaving the door open to get back into sort of whole bank M&A with the growth in TCE, and the time that's passed with  Yadkin (00:39:00) or are you thinking more not necessarily to whole bank M&A but opportunistic portfolio or non-bank acquisitions? Well, I wouldn't say that we're shifting gears. I think we're still focused on driving organic growth. We have a great platform now and we're well positioned in a number of markets. Whole bank deals are not what we're focused on. In terms of other investments, I was speaking specifically to investment opportunities to grow particular businesses like we did with capital markets. For us, we grew that from the ground up and that's $20 million a year in revenue for the shareholders that we didn't pay anything for other than investing in the personnel and some minor operating expenses. So, I think that that's really our focus and we're going to continue to stay down that path. In terms of capital, our goal is not to continue – we've never been in this position before, right? Three years ago, when we rolled out our analysis, our model, or discussed our model, gave guidance relative to the acquisition, one of the things that we said was that we needed to grow from a scale perspective to cover investments and infrastructure. We successfully, we did that by doing a large acquisition, taking the cost out from that acquisition and then growing revenue over time and we've gotten a lot of benefit from that. One of the things we called out was having our dividend payout ratio fall below 40%. We said, hey, if you look at this, the new model when we execute, we're going to be in a much better position for our shareholders from a capital perspective. Because we're going to be able to grow TCE and organically without raising capital through a common equity raise and preventing dilution and grow organically. We're going to be able to do that and get that dividend payout ratio down. Once we do that, we'll have options, I – a buyback didn't make sense for us in the past because of the valuation that we had, at certain points in time it makes sense. So, I think given where we are in the cycle, the best part about all of this is we've delivered what we said we were going to deliver. We're below 40% dividend payout ratio this quarter. We have a TCE ratio that's approaching the 7.5% mark that we indicated. Now, we have flexibility. We can do different things that provide the best benefit for the shareholders. That's where we wanted to be. Very patient, I know the street is not often patient, but I think we're in a very good position from a capital perspective and that's what we wanted to emphasize. Yeah. I could comment too, Jared, just on the buyback program that we announced. As we sit here today, we're going to look to be opportunistic, kind of preachy. So, we have the CECL estimates out there, but we'd like to get through the CECL impact kind of at the beginning of the year and then look at whether the buyback should be kind of opportunistic or kind of more programmatic as you go forward from there. But I think that's, to Vince's point, we haven't had that in our tool box before and now we do and it's something we'll use in a smart way to benefit the shareholders. Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thanks, Jared. Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust. Hey. Good morning. Hey, Michael. Hi, Michael. Good morning. Wanting to start just on the fee income side, the noninterest income. You've talked about obviously the shrink that you have had in those businesses, but it's been kind of record quarters. Is that sustainable in the next year given the trajectory of interest rates will likely to be a tailwind or do you think there has been some pull forward of some activity here in the past couple of quarters that may wane a little bit as we move forward from here? It's a tough call. I think would we have expected the mortgage company to produce what they're producing if we had the initial Bloomberg economic forecast from the beginning of the year? The answer would be no, because rates were supposed to go up not down. So, we got – and that was – that's why we entered into that business and made the investments because we said, hey it's going to protect us in an environment where we have declining rates, and it's paid dividends for us. If we if the economic environment is consistent, if the yield curve stays pretty much the way it is or rates stay low let's say that, let's hope we don't have an inversion forever, but let's say rates stay low, our prospects for delivering these types of results increases significantly. So, that was the strategy. And it really is dependent on macroeconomic factors. There is an element of core fee income built in here that we won't fall off of. So, I think that that'll keep us in the game. And what we've done with our capital markets platform building it out, we're still in our – in early stages relative to the build out of that platform. So, there is upside in international fee income. There is upside in our wealth platform. There is upside in insurance, you saw significant uptick in insurance fee income as we spread into those new geographies. So, it's our goal to sustain these levels. It's lumpy. It tends to be stronger in the middle parts of the year, the second and third quarter. But I feel pretty good about where we sit. We have a good pipeline going into fourth quarter too. No. This year in the fourth quarter because of the rate environment should help us. Yeah. I hope that's helpful. Okay. Yeah. No. It is, right? I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything large or one-time in there that we shouldn't carry forward. It's pretty granular, right. It's fairly diverse, it's pretty granular. The biggest chunk of the capital markets fee income is derivatives fee income and that's a function of the rate environment in activity and... In the new markets... ...in new markets. I think given the markets we've expanded into and we said this early on, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in Charlotte and Raleigh and Charleston and all the markets, the D.C. market that we're expanding into. There's a tremendous opportunity. Okay. Thanks for that color and maybe just one other question on loan growth. As we look forward into next year, I know you guys don't want to provide guidance but just philosophically as we think about kind of a lower rate environment and the implementation of CECL, will that impact either the structure of the loans that you make or the types of loans that you're pursuing next year or pricing? Any color you can provide around that would be helpful. Yeah. Hey, Michael, this is Gary. In terms of our underwriting and the loans that we pursue and we've – I think we've talked about this in the past. We're going to be consistent in how we do business. We don't change our views, we don't change our underwriting migrating up the curve in good times and down the curve in bad times. We're going to stay where we are. We're going to underwrite the way that we underwrite each and every day and we stay the course and we'll continue to do that as we move into 2020. And the – in terms of CECL, CECL should have an impact. Obviously, we're not a price setter. We've got some big competitors. There is hundreds, thousands of financial institutions and non-financial institutions lending. But I will tell you that the structures will change because of the absolute return on capital. We – if the amount of reserve is doubling or more, term becomes important and I think as we look forward in terms of how we underwrite, we're going to make sure we get, I hope the industry makes sure we get paid for that and I would expect us to pursue strategies to maximize returns on capital. Yeah, and shorter is going to be better, just generally speaking across the portfolios from a maturity standpoint. Okay. And just last one on the efficiency ratio, it has been good to see that kind of come down into below 55%  year end and whole (00:47:49), but there is going to be some revenue pressures obviously going forward. Do you think there is an ability to continue to defend kind of that efficiency ratio or bottom line number in the 2020 with some of the expense I believe that you discussed earlier? I would just – I guess, what I would comment on now is as you know, expense management has been a focus here for as long as we've all been here. So, being able to achieve an efficiency ratio in the 54s with the investments in the businesses that Vince discussed is, it takes a lot of work and it's something we focus on a lot. Every year, next year will be no different than this year, we'll have a long list of opportunities to create more efficiency. The items we've talked about in the past are kind of ready program and then the renegotiations that's just constant, that's kind of part of life as far as evaluating kind of your footprint as well as your relationships with all your partners and we've put in a new phone system to save money, look at how we manage  our cash (00:48:49). We're optimizing facilities next year. That's going to be a focus. We have a lot of buildings throughout our footprint and there's opportunities to optimize facilities. We're looking at bringing in third party contractors, we can bring stuff in-house and save some money and I could go on and on, there's probably 50, 60 items on the list of things that we'll continue to focus on. So, our focus to manage the overall profitability to continue to drive the profitability forward and manage the expenses and efficiency ratio and the returns. So... And I think it's a metric in our incentive compensation plan. It's focused on by the board of directors. I don't think management focus is on it. I – trust me. There's a lot of oversight over expense control here and we're very aware of the environment that we're in. But we also can't stop investing in the company. I think that we have to balance this as business leaders as managers of this enterprise. We have to balance what's good for the long-term and good for the short-term. So, we try to manage that efficiency ratio if those levels are better. And we look to make investments that will position the company either from a technology perspective or facilities perspective to drive better revenue and have better revenue growth results and better penetration in the markets that we're in. Anyway that's... Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Casey. Wanted to follow up – one more follow-up on the NIM. I was hoping to get the new money yields on loan originations versus the 4.78% existing yield in the third quarter here? I mean, with rates haven't come down, obviously the rates on the loans are lower, their reflective of the kind of market, kind of the rate on the new major 4.45% to 4.50% as far the rate overall. Now, as you know, that the mix has a lot to do with that. So, this quarter I mentioned earlier, we had a vast majority in the commercial space driving the growth. I think it's the 80% of the growth was in the commercial arena. So, that kind of helps that rate. But the mix will affect at every quarter. But that's kind of the rate for the – as I call it  (00:51:26), the new loans that we put on the books. Okay. Very good. And just a question on the purchase accounting adjustments. On slide 11, you guys talk about $125 million to be recognized post CECL day one. So, if I assume – just want to make sure my math is right here. If I assume that's a four year life, that's about $31 million of accretion per annum over four years and then which would be about $8 million a quarter which is obviously in line with what we saw here in the third quarter. Is that a decent way to think about it? Well, the way it will work going forward is it's kind of loan by loan. So, we have loans that are will be kind of accretion will be coming in over a year. You have loans that'll be coming in over 25, 30 years. So, it's truly a function with this kind of, what are the prepayments doing? So the pace of it, I mean, the $115 million to $135 million will be over the remaining life of the loan. That life can flex up or down. Yeah. I think, Casey, what Vince is saying is you can apply four years, but that's an  air grab (00:52:37). Yeah. I think... Your math is accurate if you score, but, yeah. ...yeah, it works mathematically, but there's a lot of analysis that has to go into where we end up and it really depends on changes in interest rates, the overall health of the economy... Payoffs,  (00:52:55). Yes. There are so many factors that go into it. But your math works. Okay, great. All right and just lastly on the capital management. I think everyone was excited to see the buyback, and it sounds like you guys are going to hold off until you digest CECL. If we roll forward TCE going forward March 31st, you'd probably be right around where you are on 7.5% TCE which obviously is a little bit light versus peers. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, everyone is excited about the buyback, but also a little bit nervous given where you are, so where  do you go at the end of that debate (00:53:43)? Yeah, we're not. We don't. Yeah. I guess what I – I didn't mean to interrupt you, Case, I got excited. No worries. Yeah. I think that relative to the peers, we've said this repeatedly, we don't have the same portfolio as the peers. They have elevated capital because they do some things that have an elevated level of risk, higher yields, more risk, more capital, right? We're managing a lot differently. So, as we move through this credit cycle, which I believe we're in later – we still have not lost focus, as Gary said, on where we are in the cycle. We've been in a sustained economic expansion. We're very conservative. We feel that the capital ratios that we operate with and have operated with significantly lower, by the way, for a number of almost a decade since I've been here. We feel pretty good about that, about those levels. So, 7.5% for us, given the makeup of our portfolio and the quality of the portfolio, is equivalent to somebody that might have a much higher TCE ratio with a lot more risk, a lot more maybe multi-family housing risk or some other risk in the portfolio that is outsized. It doesn't necessarily mean that's a bad thing for them. It just means that we shouldn't be managing our capital relative to peers if that's how we're going to operate. Gary, I don't know if you want to mention anything else about...? No. I think it's a very valid point. I mean it's how we run the company. It's how we do business. And one of those areas that we are not heavily involved in at all, we don't have a private equity book. We've got a couple of clients there that we do some business with, but the book is consistently underwritten as we touched on earlier and we feel it will perform well through the cycle. Plus the actions we've taken over the last three years just to take risk off the table that we've done positions us very well as we sit here today. And that action was a late-cycle action to position the balance sheet the way we wanted it going into a later-stage economy. And, Casey, just to clarify too, we'll look to be opportunistic as far as the buyback this quarter and then once kind of CECL is in place and we take a look at the environment going forward, then we'll kind of evaluate whether it becomes kind of more programmatic over the course of the year versus opportunistic. But for now, we will be opportunistic where it makes sense to do it and the returns make sense. So – and if we get north of the 7.5% or when we get north of the 7.5%, we're going to look at the loan growth and the loan growth prospects going forward and if we can deploy the capital in mid to high-single digit loan growth, we'll put it into that. If we look like we're going to build capital beyond the 7.5%, a level that we're very comfortable with as Vince and Gary described, then we'll look to either do something with the dividend or maybe do more of the buyback at that point, but again over the course of the year is the kind of the game plan for that amount. Understood. Thank you. Thank you, Casey. Thanks, Case. Thank you. And the next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Thanks, good morning, guys. Good morning, Collyn. Good morning, Collyn. Just back to the loan growth and if you guys offered this, I apologize for missing it, but I think your original guidance for the year was I think 4% to 8% in the loan growth. Just based on kind of the commentary that you're offering, I mean I would assume that it's likely that you'll come in closer to the low-end of that range for the year. Number one, is that – just clarity on that. And then, number two, just back into the – in terms of the loan yield discussion, as you said, Vince, obviously it varies within the segments, but just was curious to get a little bit more detail as to what the yields are that you're putting or the structures that you're putting on in the resi book and then what maybe some of the yields were on the CRE versus C&I? Hope you want to comment on the commercial side? Yeah. I mean in terms of the commercial book, the rates continue to be under pressure, Collyn. We've talked about quarter point step-downs over time. I think you're seeing that again. You're in the high 1s to 2% range on good solid paper, on extremely strong paper your –  1.25% to 1.50% (00:58:24). And we've seen a few of those very solid investment grade type companies that we do some good business with as well as ancillary business and deposit business. So, you look at the whole relationship and it all gets priced in together. So, that's kind of where – what we're seeing today from a commercial standpoint as far as pricing is concerned. On CRE, you're still at 2%, 2.25%, some are higher. Some you're going to get down to 1.75% as well on the stronger transaction. So it's just continued to be pressured slightly downward as the economy has continued to perform. Collyn, were you asking relative to implementation of CECL going forward or were you just asking about...? No, no, no. Just, yeah, what Gary answered, just the loan originations... Yeah. Okay. ...you're seeing in the market. Yeah. And just the competitive pressures and the impact. Yes. Yes. Yeah, perfect. Okay, because I was going to say I don't think anybody is pricing term differently today. That's all. Okay. Okay. Helpful. Relative to the implementation of CECL. And, Collyn, on the mortgage side, I mean if I look at the new rates for the last couple months of the quarter, we were in the  3.65% to 3.70% (00:59:42) kind of area all-in for the mortgage loans that we originated. Okay. Okay. Are you retaining – is it a blend of what you're retaining there in terms of duration? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on the muni deposit side, you guys have seen some strength there and continue to build that business. How are you seeing the pricing within that segment? Are you able to lower the rates there as rates have come down or is that also somewhat competitive? Everything is competitive when you start talking about big dollars. So I would say that they manage – they're managing because they're on budgets and we're in a declining rate environment. The treasurers of these large municipal entities are trying to drive as much income as they can. So I would say it is competitive. I think the differentiator for us is that we don't just participate in the high-yielding pieces of that relationship. We go after the whole relationship. We provide them with a whole bunch of treasury management services and they use free balances to pay for those services typically. The municipalities typically like to use their balances that way. I would say as we move forward and as I mentioned earlier, typically we're competing against large banks in that space. They start to feel pressure, margin pressure, the pricing starts to become more favorable. So I think in certain respects as we move through this point in the cycle with the yield curve the way it is and pressure on margins, I think you'll see us benefit from that, because we're in the driver's seat with the relationship basically. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just broadly, you guys had indicated you'll continue to look for offsets to the business in general, right, to continue to drive performance next year if this rate environment holds. But I guess my question is a little bit more specifically to the balance sheet. So are there, Vince, as you look at it will the goal and the objective be to try to keep core NIM flat in 2020 or if this – let's say we see another cut in the beginning of 2020 will you continue to see core NIM compression? Just trying to get a sense of... I... Go ahead. Yeah. I assume you were asking for Vince C., so I'll let him answer this. You're welcome, Vince D., to answer it if you'd like, but yeah. Yeah, thank you. Well go ahead, Vince. I guess what I would say, Collyn, is, as we talked about earlier, I mean our job is to protect the net interest margin and the net interest income dollars are key, right? So, the better we do  (01:02:39) loans and fund it with deposits the better we're going to do. And we've had DDA growth now every quarter for how many quarters, so the success we've had there obviously protects the margin too. So, I mean, we're all very focused on protecting that as we go forward... Yeah. ...and dealing with whatever's in front of us and growing the loans and deposits, growing the fee revenue sources like Vince talked about, and there's still upside particularly in the new markets and in the capital markets. So, I mean, we're going to be working hard at the whole – all pieces of the profitability to grow the earnings and protect the margin and net interest income. Okay. Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks guys. Thank you, Collyn. Thanks, Collyn. Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery. Hey. Good morning guys. Hey, Brian. Good morning, Brian. Hey, Brian. Hey. Most of mine were answered. I guess just a couple things. I mean, Vince, did you talk about or give any color kind of on the forward loan pipeline today, just kind of where it stands relative to last quarter just with the performance? Yeah. We haven't done that. We weren't planning on giving pipeline information, but I will tell you it remains strong. Commercially it's strong. Mortgage, I already mentioned is strong on a relative basis, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And Carolinas are strong too. Carolinas are strong, Raleigh still has a big pipeline and they're still one of our top performers on an FTE basis. So I think, yeah, we're pretty optimistic about that but we're cautious about where we are in the cycle, so we're trying to balance that with a little bit of discipline. Right, certainly, understood. And how about just your ability to hire folks? I mean, some of your competitors have talked about a lot of the disruption in the markets and the success they're having, I guess I know it's an ongoing process for you guys as well, but just any comments you guys can share on your ability to hire this year based on kind of what you've done in years past? I mean, have you seen more momentum on the hiring side or anything on that? Yeah. I think we're probably out there pretty early if you go back to – I think if you pull transcripts from eight years ago we talked about our ability to hire people from larger institutions that can cross-sell effectively, if we're allowed to say cross-sell, sophisticated products and services. I think that we've always done a great job of bringing in the best talent we can bring in and we've had no issue at all attracting people to this company, zero. And just because we don't brag about it every quarter doesn't mean it's not happening, so we tend to be a little more quiet about it. We respect the other financial institutions that we compete against and when we're able to secure a good person we bring them in and we have had no issue doing that. And we will opportunistically bring people in if we feel – if somebody is interested and we feel there's a potential upside. So we just don't talk a lot about it; that's not our culture. We think that it's best to just continue to focus on running the business and not talk about those things anyway. Yeah, I guess... That's... Yeah. I guess I'm just kind of wondering if the sense is if you saw any momentum or the disruption in the market giving you more opportunity than you've seen in the past. Absolutely. It absolutely does. It has for us over a decade and a half. So Pittsburg is a great example. I mean, look what happened 12 years ago, 10 years ago. I mean there was an incredible amount of disruption and we were able to benefit, and many of the people that we hired from larger institutions there are still here. And I mention we keep winning these awards in all the markets we go into; those are our employees commenting on the culture. I think that's important and that helps us attract people and retain them. Got you. Okay. And then maybe one for Vince C. Just Vince, when you look at – just kind of going back to the margin for a minute, but just as you look at the repricing of the earning assets and the lag in the deposit side, I mean is it fair to think about it that if we do get more increases, if we get several more rate decreases here that the moderation, I guess that the decline in the margin could moderate some the more rate cuts you get? I guess the deposit beta could get higher the more rate cuts we get. Is that fair way to think about it? I guess I'm just not sure the pricing dynamics on the loans versus deposits. I know there's a lag initially, but as that catches up seems like it would allow the degradation of the margin to moderate some. But is that the wrong way to think about it? No, I think it's the right way to think about it. I think like Vince talked about, it's very competitive on the deposit side so there's opportunities to do it but you're balancing, keeping the account and the balance and repricing it down. So there's, I mean, the more the Fed moves the more cover you have, right, so that you kind of have to keep pace. I mean, on the way up I can assure you those customers were calling us every time the Fed moved to try to get their rate to go up, so there's definitely opportunity there to kind of continue to reprice those and rightsize them for kind of where rates are. And that's part of the yield curve, what happens to the rest of the yield curve, right? The longer end of the yield curve actually has gone up a few basis points right, Scott? Yeah. I think in your scenario the slope of the curve matters. So if they continue to cut, and we don't see significant deterioration in the middle part of the curve, we – obviously it would moderate, the margin pressure moderates. So it really matters, the slope matters, and we'll see what happens. I'm not smart enough to forecast what happens when the rates are cut by the Fed given all the other elements in the analysis. But if you talk to a bunch of economists they'd probably tell you that it's likely that the yield curve starts to resemble a more normal curve as those cuts occur. So in that case you would be right that there would be moderation in the pressure. Got you. Okay, I got you. That's helpful. And just remind me have you guys talked about the floors you have in the loan portfolio, what percent of the loans have floors and just kind of where they're at today? We don't have a substantial amount of floors in the portfolio. We have found that for higher quality borrowers, particularly in the commercial space, they don't accept them. Yeah. So we try to utilize derivatives to the best of our ability to fixed rates for our borrowers and to create collars and – that really protects us because we're receiving – they're receiving a fixed rate, we're getting a variable rate revenue stream or income and I think that that's how we go after it. The floors are very challenging to put into effect. Probably a little easier maybe on the consumer side but I'm not sure that we have many even in the consumer book. (01:10:22) Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then you answered my question on efficiency, but just the last one for Gary. Just any anything you're seeing on the credit front, Gary? It doesn't sound like it from a systemic standpoint that there's any worries out there. Or just any areas you'd point to that are I guess maybe you're more cautious on today as you get later in the cycle? You know, Brian, as we've discussed, I mean we continue to see solid performance across the portfolio. I mean that said, and Vince mentioned it earlier, we're managing the book from a late stage economy perspective, and we have been for a while now. So we're really focused on the economically-sensitive commodity tariff-related segments as well as transportation. So those economically-sensitive areas we're continuing to watch very closely. We've not seen softness at this point. And based on the diversification across our book and the concentration management techniques that we have in place and the industries and also geographical diversification, we feel very good about where we are at this point. So we'll continue to watch those as the economy moves forward. Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Brian. Thank you. And at this time I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments. Yeah. Thank you very much and we're very pleased with our accomplishments through the first three quarters of this year. We're looking to finish strong. Our focus is and will continue to be focusing on sustaining earnings per share growth and delivering on all of the areas that we mentioned, expense control, loan and deposit growth, managing the margin through a difficult climate; that will continue to be our focus. So I'd like to thank all of our employees again for their tremendous contribution. I think we've had a great year so far this year and we're looking to close it out strong. And thank you for participating in the call. We appreciate your interest and we'd like to thank the shareholders for supporting us along the way. Thank you. Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Great Southern Bancorp Inc. Third Quarter 2019 Earning (sic) [Earnings] Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kelly Polonus. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon and welcome. This is Kelly Polonus with Investor Relations for Great Southern Bancorp. The purpose of our call today is to discuss the company's results for the quarter ending September 30, 2019. Before we begin, I need to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements about future events and future financial performance. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. These statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or projected. For a list of some of these factors, please see the forward-looking statement disclosure in our third quarter 2019 earnings release. President and CEO, Joe Turner; and Chief Financial Officer, Rex Copeland, are here with me. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Turner. All right. Thanks, Kelly, and good afternoon to everyone who is on the call. I want to thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. As usual, I'll provide some introductory remarks, some high-level remarks, and then Rex – turn it over to Rex to talk a little bit more in detail about the income statement. Overall, our third quarter results were very good. Hopefully, you've had a chance to read the earnings release. And if you have, you've seen that we earned $1.38 a share or $19.7 million. We saw good loan growth during the quarter and we further improved our operational efficiency. While net income dollars did grow, we experienced some net interest margin compression during the quarter and Rex will provide some color around that. Our performance metrics were all strong. Our return on common equity, 13.46%; return on assets, 1.61%, net interest margin was 3.95%, I think 3.75% core; and our efficiency ratio was 52.63%. Loan production during the third quarter was pretty solid. We had growth both in outstanding loans and our pipeline during the quarter both when compared to the end of the year and when compared to the linked quarter. The increase in our outstanding loans was primarily due to increases in commercial real estate, owner occupied, one- to four-family and multi-family loans. That was partially offset by decreases in the consumer auto loan portfolio which we've talked to you guys about before. We do continue to believe that the market's slowing. We've seen lower deal flow I think. And typically, when rates start reducing, it's as a result of the economy slowing and maybe lenders are getting scared so you'll see increased credit spread. Right now, we're seeing decrease in credit spreads and higher levels of competition for lower deal flow. So I think it's a challenging environment from a loan growth perspective. You don't really see that coming through in our pipeline. Our pipeline is still strong. But I think maybe looking further out the loan business does seem to be slowing from a production standpoint. Asset quality is probably as good as it's ever been at our bank. So that's certainly a positive thing. Our classified assets, the capital and reserves, are 3%. And as I said, that's as good as it's ever been at our bank. We looked at a slide yesterday in our board meeting that compared, looked at that number over a long period of time and even in other very benign credit environments, we've never been as low as we are now. Capital continues to be very strong. We've grown our capital since the end of the year, since the end of the second quarter. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets is at 11.9% at the end of the third quarter. Our book value per share is almost $42. And we were pleased to introduce our or increase our dividend during the third quarter to $0.34 a share. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rex Copeland, our CFO. All right. Thank you, Joe. Just a couple of things I wanted to point out as sort of unusual items in the quarter, we highlighted those on the first page of the earnings release. But we did have a benefit of reduced insurance premium expense for our FDIC insurance premiums, the fund has hit certain thresholds and so we have a credit coming back to us and that reduced our expenses by a little over $300,000 in the quarter. We also did have a couple of valuation write-downs on some foreclosed assets that was about $280,000 of additional expense there reflected in those write-downs on those two assets. As Joe mentioned earlier, we did see a little bit of compression in our net interest margin as a percentage. The dollars were higher but the margin percentage was a little bit lower. We're at 3.95% reported in the third quarter and that compared to 3.97% in the second quarter and 4.02% in the third quarter last year. So we have a little bit of lower rates on our investment securities and other interest earning assets, so funds that we have at the Federal Reserve and things like that. The Fed fund rates have come down and so we are seeing a little bit of a decrease from where we were a year ago. And that our rates paid on deposits are sort of flattish and other borrowings. So we are seeing a little bit of compression from those areas. We did have some yield accretion income. It was a little bit higher in this third quarter than we had in the second quarter and the third quarter last year, so about 20 basis points of additional income or margin related to the accretion on FDIC-acquired loan pools.  (00:07:25) the dollar amounts were up from where we were a year ago and also in the second quarter of this year. So we continue to kind of push through that with a little bit of increase in dollars but the margin percentage has come back a little bit. In the third quarter we did – we talked before about our interest rate swap that we did late last year and included in our interest income in the third quarter this year was just over $800,000 of income related to that swap. So where the current LIBOR rates are now compared to the amount that – rate that we received on that swap, there's about 100 basis points or so difference in that. And so that's what's reflected in the net settlements that we have with our counterparty there. The non-interest income section of the financials, we did have lower non-interest income compared to the year ago quarter. As you'll remember, the year ago quarter, we had sale of the branches and deposits in Nebraska, and we booked about a $7.4 million gain on that sale in the quarter last year. So we did not have that obviously again this year and that's related to some of the decrease we had. We did offset that a little bit with a little bit higher income in profit on loan sales during the quarter. Also, as we've had throughout this year a little bit higher income on our debit card activity related to some contracts that we entered into at the beginning or at the end of last year for the beginning of this year. And then also in the third quarter, we did have quite a bit of income and this will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter related to income on interest rate swaps that we entered into with customers and counterparties, and also a little bit of income from exiting some of our certain tax credit partnerships that we had. So there was definitely some nice flow of income that came through in some of those categories and not all of those things happened every quarter. But we did experience some good income in the third quarter of this year from that. Non-interest expense, we continue to make operational efficiency and kind of containment of our expenses a priority and we've been able to do that. Our non-interest expenses were about – up about $416,000 compared to the same quarter of last year. Salary employee benefits, probably the largest area of our increases. Like I said before, we did have a $300,000-plus decrease in insurance cost because of the credit we got back on the FDIC insurance and then a little bit lower expenses on our acquired deposit intangible asset amortization as some of those items have met their kind of final term now, and we amortized off all those intangibles for certain of the acquisitions. Our efficiency ratio, as Joe said, was down to 52.63% in the quarter. That's down from where it was in the second quarter of this year and it's up from last year because of the large gain that we had. But we feel like we're continuing to make good progress on efficiency and we'll continue to look toward that. One last thing I was going to mention is just briefly an update on CECL. We've been working through that throughout the year and continuing to finalize a few things with our accountants right now. Based on our analysis, we're looking at both the on-balance sheet items and off-balance sheet unfunded items, and that's kind of an impact for us. The larger impact is going to be probably the unfunded loan balances and commitments and things that we have. But overall, with all of it combined, we expect the impact of CECL to be 2% to 3% decrease in our equity when we adopt that in the beginning of 2020. So that concludes our prepared remarks at this time, and I think we're ready to entertain questions. So I'll turn it back to the operator. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Michael Perito. Your line is open. Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Hi, Mike. Hey, Mike. Since you brought it up, Rex, so maybe let's spend a minute on CECL here. Just curious the 2%, 3% equity impact doesn't seem that dramatic, so I guess a two-part question here, one, really shouldn't impact your capital planning at all whether near term or long term, right? And then, two, just as you went through that process, any info you're willing to share kind of or different views on your portfolio that the CECL process forced you to say that might alter kind of your credit appetite going forward, for certain asset classes or anything of that nature? Yeah. I think first part, we don't expect it to really be all that impact into our capital. Obviously, it's not going to be a really – we don't think a really large number at this point. And then as far as the type of lending and things like that, I don't really see it being that impactful to the things that we do. I think we'll probably continue to do things in generally the same manner looking at same type of loans. It might cause us to look at I mean individual loans would obviously be looked at on an individual basis. But we may look at do we want to make a loan that's maybe a little shorter term than we might otherwise. But I don't think it's going to be really impactful on what we're doing there either. Okay. And then on the – Joe, on the growth side, it seems like you guys are  (00:13:52) kind of growingly more cautious maybe just slightly, but as every quarter kind of pass this year and we get through this 2019. But I guess to your point specifically, you mentioned that pipelines are still strong. So I guess can you maybe comment on kind of how the pull-through of that pipeline has been trending year-to-date thus far and whether you think you'll probably be closing on less deals in the pipeline moving forward or have you seen a material alteration in kind of the closing rate even though the pipeline hasn't changed much? I don't think it's that so much, Mike. I mean, I think – when I look at our pipeline, I think the two key numbers really are the close construction loans with unused available lines particularly the not one- to four-family because that's a big number and then the loan commitment not closed yet, both secured by one- to four-family and secured by not one- to four-family. And I anticipate that our pull-through rate will be not significantly different than it's been in the past in those areas. I guess my – I'm just talking more anecdotally, I sit in on the committee so I see all of the larger loan requests that we're considering and it just seems like that's slowing down a little bit. And as I talked to the leaders in our various offices, they say the same thing that it seems to be a little bit less activity and a little bit more competitive. For instance, we were looking at a loan request yesterday. And the thing just the – based on the kind of spread, the LIBOR we were getting in the past, it seemed 25 basis points or so low from where it should be. And so I mentioned that during our loan committee and one of our senior lenders just said that's kind of where the market is right now. So I think it is – I guess my observation is more anecdotal than maybe factual, the factual is probably our pipeline. But I do feel like it's probably things are slowing down not dramatically but just slightly. Okay. And then lastly, I mean obviously the core NIM compressed a bit in the quarter which you guys addressed, and there's obviously a decent probability that that interest rates continue to kind of work against this year. But conversely, the SBA and mortgage gain on sale activity really served as kind of a nice offset in the quarter and I'm just curious if you could comment on the outlook for those items. The SBA specifically which I know is a bit newer for you guys. And do you think that that's something where you guys can see some fee income growth and hopefully will be offset some of the NII pressures that could stem from a lower margin if interest rates continue to decline? Yeah. We hope to, Mike. Yeah, we do have – we're actively looking for SBA loans throughout our footprint. And so, we hope to see that kind of volume. It's probably going to come in fits and spurts a little bit here initially until we get a pipeline of that built up too. So, I wouldn't say that it's going to be real sort of kind of very normalized in recurring that way, but we certainly hope to grow it. And as you say, one- to four-family volume has been strong force as well. Yeah. That's going to probably be somewhat a reflection of interest rates and refinance is part of it and the new purchase and that kind of thing too. We have had – our loans held for sale balances have been higher in the last couple of quarters than they were last year and early this year. So we are continuing to see a little bit higher level of activity in that. Can't guarantee that's going to happen in the next few quarters but where it's at right now it seems to be reasonably positive. Got it. And then just one quick last follow-up, sorry. But just on the SBA theme, can you just remind us how built out is that platform at this point for you guys? I mean, how much kind of capacity is there with the current team and support staff and credit staff on board that you think you can support? I mean, is there are a lot of runway there or do you think if it accelerates there could be need for kind of further broadening of the support, etcetera of that platform? We're trying to utilize – the source deals, we're trying to utilize our existing staff throughout the branches, throughout the – throughout our lending teams that sort of thing. And then we have to help with the kind of the back office part of it we've contracted with the company to help with that. So that can certainly scale up. If we were doing way, way, way more volume, we might have to grow kind of our administration of that program a little bit. But I think we have opportunity to grow a lot without seeing really increased costs for a while anyway. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys, for taking my questions. I appreciate it. All right. Thanks, Mike. Thank you.  Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Andrew. Most of my questions have been asked already. Just want to follow-up on deposit pricing here. It didn't seem like there was too much movement in the rates quarter-over-quarter. But what are you seeing in the markets that you guys are in with respect to pricing? And are there opportunities to lower your offered rates following these Fed rate cuts? I'd say it's pretty competitive as far as there's different banks and credit unions that are still advertising specials of money market rates and CD rates above 2%. And so we're trying to manage in that environment. I think we're seeing areas where we've been able to reduce our rates on a few things, but not across the board certainly. And so we're going to continue to kind of fight that battle a little bit. Money market rates and some of the interest-bearing checking rates, there's not a ton of room for those to come down yet probably. So we're still trying to kind of work through that. There's a few of our products that we have reduced rates on but not, like I said, across the board. We see a little migration I would say to between non-time account types. And so there's been some flow of funds into some of the higher yield money market-type accounts, and so we're not really seeing too much of a decrease in the non-time overall rates. The time accounts we're kind of just fairly recent, the rate cuts that have occurred and so it takes a few months for those to kind of filter through. We are seeing in some of our deposit types that we've been able to reduce the funding costs on the maturity and then the new booking of new products in those types. Retail CDs, a lot of our CDs mature within three to 12 months and so we're probably in the fourth quarter, hopefully, going to see a little more of the maturities start to replace with a bit lower rate and that kind of thing that we saw in the third quarter. We just didn't really have a chance with – when the rate cuts occurred, it just didn't – with that – there's not that many maturities that occurred within the third quarter there. So we expect that we'll see some of the rates that are going to be rolling off here in the next two or three quarters. The current market rates would be lower than where those are. So we would hope that we would see some decrease in the overall funding cost on the time accounts as well. Yeah. Okay. So I mean the – what you would have seen immediately both in margin and then you would have been – you would have noticed in our spread calculation is if we had been able to reduce our non-time accounts. But as Rex said, competition is really preventing us from doing that to any great extent. And then with respect to time accounts, really, I think the cost of new origination CDs is coming down a little bit. So that's a positive thing. But I don't know what the average term of our CD portfolio is, probably between six months and a year, something like that. It's going to take you some time to roll through that and reprice enough of it that you see much of a change. Okay. That's all really helpful. You've answered all my other questions. Thanks so much. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Turner for any closing remarks. Again, we appreciate everybody being on the call with us today and we look forward to talking to you after the end of the year. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Welcome to Signature Bank's 2019 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Hosting the call today from Signature Bank are Joseph J. DePaolo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric R. Howell, Executive Vice President, Corporate & Business Development. Today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Joseph J. DePaolo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Signature Bank 2019 third quarter results conference call. Before I begin my formal remarks, Susan Lewis will read the forward-looking disclaimer. Please go ahead, Susan. Thank you, Joe.

You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statements made by Signature Bank speak only as of the date on which they were made. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe. Thank you, Susan. I will provide some overview into the quarterly results. And then, Eric Howell, our EVP of Corporate and Business Development, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. 2019 third quarter was our strongest quarter for deposit growth in the last three years, leading to solid earnings. The quarter included a record average deposit growth of $1.75 billion which allowed us to substantially pay down higher cost borrowing. Additionally, we made significant strides in transforming our balance sheet to include more floating rate assets by increasing commercial and industrial loans by $885 million and meaningfully decreasing fixed rate commercial real estate loans. We're really firing on all cylinders this quarter with contributions from our traditional private client banking teams and Signature Financial. The major initiatives we've put in place over the last several quarters are helping to drive deposit growth, as well as further our asset and geographic diversification strategy. This includes the launch of Signet as well as contributions from the digital banking team, the Fund Banking Division and the Venture Banking Group. Moreover, we recently added the Specialized Mortgage Servicing Banking Team focusing on treasury management products, the deposit-rich residential and commercial mortgage services, amongst others. This team now has the necessary infrastructure in place to support their clients' needs and is officially open for business. Now, on to the quarter. Signature Bank delivered another quarter of solid performance, led by a record $1.75 billion average deposit growth, while maintaining overall strong credit quality and delivering solid earnings. Net income for the 2019 third quarter was $148.7 million or $2.75 diluted earnings per share compared with $155.4 million or $2.84 diluted earnings per share from last year. The decrease in net income was due to a rise in non-interest expense from the significant investment in new private client banking team, including 55 professionals across the Fund Banking Division, the Venture Banking Group and the Specialized Mortgage Servicing Banking Team. We look forward to the future contributions to growth and earnings from these new teams. Now, looking at deposit. While confronted by a challenging deposit environment, we increased deposits by over $1.5 billion to $39.1 billion this quarter. And average deposits grew a record $1.75 billion. Since the end of the 2018 third quarter, both period-ending and average deposits have increased by $3 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits at $12 billion represent 31% of total deposits. Deposit and loan growth, coupled with earnings retention, led to an increase of $3.5 billion or 8% in total assets from a year ago. Now, let's take a look at our lending businesses. During the quarter, in keeping with our diversification strategy, we made a conscious decision to not refinance CRE loans where no deposit relationship existed. We have essentially exited most of these one-sided loan relationships. We do not expect the same level of decline prospectively. As a result, loans during the 2019 third quarter increased $5 million to $37.9 billion. For the prior 12 months, loans grew $2.8 billion. This quarter, we significantly increased floating rate C&I loans by $885 million, driven primarily by our Fund Banking Division. And conversely, we dramatically decreased our fixed rate CRE portfolio by $873 million. Floating rate loans are now 17% of total loans, which is a dramatic improvement from 10% a year ago. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is now at 97%. Our CRE concentration declined to 511% from its peak of 593%. Turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Non-accrual loans are $32.5 million or just 9 basis points of total loans compared with $41.3 million or 11 basis points for the 2019 second quarter. Our past due loans remained in their normal range with 30 to 89-day past due loans at $59 million and 90-day plus past due loans at a low $1.9 million. Net charge-offs for the 2019 third quarter were $2.9 million or 3 basis points compared with net recoveries of $3.7 billion (sic) [$3.7 million] for the 2019 second quarter. Provision for loan losses for the 2019 third quarter was $1.2 million compared with $5.4 million for the 2019 second quarter. The allowance for loan losses remained stable at 64 basis points of loans. And our coverage ratio stands at 746%. My last point before I turn the call over to Eric. I just want to remind you on the team front. We've added four private client banking teams, including the 28-person Venture Banking Group, which already has made meaningful contribution this quarter; and the 15-member Specialized Mortgage Banking Servicing Team (sic) [Servicing Banking Team], which is now ready for business. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric. And he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the third quarter reached $328 million, up $3.2 million when compared with the 2018 third quarter and an increase of $1.7 million from the 2019 second quarter. Net interest margin decreased 20 basis points in the quarter versus the comparable period a year ago and declined 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.68%. Excluding prepayment penalty income, core net interest margin for the linked quarter decreased 5 basis points to 2.66%; 4 basis points of this decrease was from excess cash balances driven by significant deposit growth. And let's look at asset yields and funding cost for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields decreased 9 basis points from the linked quarter to 3.94%. The decrease in overall asset yields was driven by higher cash balances and lower reinvestment rates in all our primary asset classes from the lower rate environment. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 9 basis points linked quarter to 3.18% due to the dramatic decline in market rates, which also led to our portfolio duration coming into 2.2 years. Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 4 basis points to 4.2% compared with the 2019 second quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased 2 basis points. Prepayment penalties for the 2019 third quarter remained low at $2.1 million compared with $3.6 million for the 2019 second quarter and $4.1 million in the 2018 third quarter. We anticipate that prepayment penalty income will remain low as a result of the slowdown in CRE transaction activity from the changes in rent regulation and the low interest rate environment. Now, looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter increased by 2 basis points to 1.21%. However, they appear to have peaked in July, which is a good sign for future quarters. Average borrowings, excluding subordinated debt, decreased $1.1 billion to $5.2 billion or 10.5% of our average balance sheet. The average borrowing cost decreased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.59%. Overall, the cost of funds for the linked quarter decreased 2 basis points to 1.4%, as lower cost deposits replaced higher cost borrowings. And on to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income for the 2019 third quarter was $6 million, an increase of $1.4 million when compared with the 2018 third quarter, mostly due to a rise of $1.3 million in fees and service charges. Non-interest expense for the 2019 third quarter was $134.3 million versus $117.2 million for the same period a year ago. The $17.1 million or 14.6% increase was mostly due to the meaningful addition of private client banking teams. The bank's efficiency ratio was 40.2% for the 2019 third quarter versus 39.4% for the 2019 second quarter. The efficiency ratio has been negatively affected by the decline in NIM and our investments in long-term strategic initiatives. And turning to capital. In the 2019 third quarter, the bank paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share. Additionally, the bank increased its stock repurchases to 630,000 shares of common stock for a total of $75 million. The dividend and share buybacks had a minor effect on capital ratios, which all remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low risk profile of the balance sheet, as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio that increased 5 basis points to 9.51%. And now, I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you. Thanks, Eric. This quarter, we continued to execute our game plan by significantly growing deposits $1.5 billion, including increasing average deposits by a record $1.75 billion, improving our liquidity position by reducing borrowings of $1 billion – by $1 billion, excuse me, and decreasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to 97%, increasing floating rate, commercial and industrial loans by $885 million and reducing fixed rate commercial real estate loans by $873 million, bringing our commercial real estate concentration to 511% from its peak of 593%. Now, we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Nicole, I'll turn it over to you. The floor is now open for questions.  Thank you. Our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Ebrahim. I guess, first question, Eric, if you can just talk about in terms of the margin outlook, particularly in the context of where you see cost of interest-bearing deposits going over the next few quarters and just the thought process around the excess liquidity, given the negative carry of the cash versus the borrowings that you have on the balance sheet. Sure, Ebrahim. We expect that the NIM next quarter would be flat with a slight downward bias, given the fact that we are still sitting on cash and we've had some pretty significant deposit flows again thus far this quarter. We're obviously looking to deploy that into loans. And we do anticipate that we'll have significant loan growth in the fourth quarter. We have a pretty robust pipeline. And we do not anticipate having anywhere near the level of CRE run-off that we had in the third quarter. So, that should bode well for the margin. Ultimately, we're looking to use that cash to put into loans or to pay down higher cost borrowings. We predominantly paid off the overnight borrowings that we can. So, we're waiting for term borrowings to come due, which we have a fair share of that coming due in November and December. So, given all of that, we expect to maintain margins with a slight downward bias. And the cost of interest-bearing deposits, do you expect that to start trending lower and to what magnitude? It's been trending lower. July was really our peak in the deposit cost. We've seen it come down 8 basis points from that peak. And really, the July move, we moved down our deposit cost but not nearly as much as we did coming off the September move. So, that should really bode well for October and for the fourth quarter. Got it. And just moving to deposit growth, as we think about going forward, if you could remind us in terms of where we are in terms of the two or three different teams that you hired over the last year in terms of their production levels and what you expect from the Mortgage Servicing Team in terms of deposit growth. Like, should we expect growth to begin kicking in, in the fourth quarter? And if you can put a framework around the magnitude of growth that team can bring. The Mortgage Servicing Banking Team is now open for business in the fourth quarter. What they were doing was preparing, along with a lot of our operations and administrative and support team to work to get ready for this quarter. So, with the $1.5 billion growth that we had in the third quarter, none of it came from the Mortgage Servicing Team because they weren't open for business until now in the fourth quarter. So, again, that really bodes well because we expect significant deposit growth over the next couple of years from that team. That team controls over $22 billion in deposits at Wells Fargo. The Venture Banking Group, they've contributed during the third quarter a little over $100 million in deposits. And we expect about that level on a quarterly basis going forward. And the Fund Banking team is contributing, in large part, on the loan side. It's going to take them a couple of years or so to work out where they would be funding themselves. So, we're very excited about the near-term and intermediate-term future because we've been having such success in growing deposits. And now, we're going to have even more success with the teams that we've just added on. And do you think, Joe, just tied to the Mortgage Servicing Team, given just the size of what they did at their previous bank, could deposit growth over the next 12 months trend closer to the higher end of your $3 billion to $5 billion target? It could. It's very possible. Right now, the deposit growth for the year for the last 12 months or so has been $3 billion. So, we could – right now, as Eric mentioned, the deposit growth in the fourth quarter, although it's only 17 days, was pretty good. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Jared? Your line is open. Can you hear me, guys? Now we can. Okay. Sorry about that. Just following up on the margin, what should we – what term borrowings are rolling off as we look over the next few quarters? And once we see those paid down, should we expect the cash position to get back to a more normal position? I know you said that deposits will first be used to fund loans. But with the borrowing levels down, that should be a good pickup for margin. Yeah. We've got about $400 million roughly in borrowings per quarter that we should be able to pay down. Like we said, we've got a robust loan pipeline that we could easily see $1 billion in loan growth. So, certainly, as little as $500 million, but we could see $1 billion in loans this quarter. So, we anticipate putting the cash to good use. And those borrowings... Okay. ...were at about 2.5%. Okay. Great. And then, on the CRE pay-down, do you say that the non-relationship refi opportunity is sort of done? Or it's the pace won't be at the same level? And if it is still continuing, I guess, how much more could we see in terms of the re-shifting of – out of CRE from that? No, it's virtually done. We are now doing business this quarter. We're essentially done with – there could be some  (00:21:23) here and there. But it's essentially done. So, our expectation is, let's say, flat growth on CRE with the Fund Banking team as well as the traditional C&I teams making up for a lot of the growth going forward. And then, just finally for me, as the CRE capital concentration keeps coming down and your stock price looks attractive here, should we – or could we expect to see the buyback become a bigger component of capital management? And what's your appetite, I guess, for reloading that if you finish out the $500 million earlier than expected? Well, I mean, it was – we meaningfully increased it this quarter. So, I think you could see similar levels, if not a little bit more, going forward. As you said, certainly, a lot of that is dependent on stock price from where that is and where growth comes in. We did increase it a bit this quarter, as we saw that our loan growth was going to be simply a little bit less than typical. So, we anticipate that loan growth will be much more positive than it was this quarter. So, we'll have to take that into account as well. Okay. But in terms of that CRE, as a percentage of capital, do you feel comfortable with it here just above 500% and continuing to be to be in the market with  about a (00:22:53)... We think it will drift to under 500% in an installment of four. So, we're comfortable at that level, yes. Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Great. Good morning. Good morning, Ken. Good morning, Ken. I was hoping you guys could address, sort of, the NIM outlook a little bit. And I guess it's – I know your comment that this is going to be relatively flat to down a little bit in the fourth quarter. But I guess, everyone, me and probably the whole market look at you guys as being liability-sensitive. And this should be a fantastic time to own Signature to be Signature because your deposit costs are going down and you're going to have NIM expansion. We're not seeing that yet. Can you just talk about, sort of, why fourth quarter is flat to down in terms of NIM? And if you can, definitely love to hear more about early 2020 as well. Thanks. Well, there's a couple things going on there, Ken. First of all, we have an inverted yield curve. So that's not very helpful at all on the asset side of the equation. So, we're going to continue to see pressures on that asset yields. But there's also lag to our ability to reprice deposits down. And I think you've got to look out several quarters and really to a time when the Fed stops cutting. We'll continue to be reducing deposit costs. So, our process is very negotiated with our clients. We're not like a traditional retail bank where you can just cut cost across the board. So, it's a negotiated process. And it takes time for us to work through those negotiations. But ultimately, we will re-price down deposits enough to more than offset the reductions on the asset side. But it's going to take a little bit of time. We're a lot more interested in bringing in new business to continue to grow the existing clients that we have. And if that cost us 1 basis point or 2 basis points on NIM, that's – so be it because we want to build the franchise value. And we find that it's better to build and have a little bit more costs than it is to let the client opportunities pass away. Got it. Totally understood. I mean, could there be a point in the first half of next year where you actually do see NIM expansion, kind of, if the – and curve remains inverted? Yes, there absolutely could be and should be. Got you. Okay. Perfect. And then, just the second question I had, in terms of CECL, I would imagine there's going to be a fairly sizable below the line or AOCI hit from CECL. But my question really is more on the ongoing impact of CECL, given that you're running off the CRE book releases flat to down a little bit. Do you have any guidance in terms of, sort of, the ongoing quarter-by-quarter provision expense? Yeah. Unfortunately, it's a little bit early for us to tell. We're still finalizing our models and running through parallel tests on those. So, it's hard for us to predict the go-forward. Certainly, there will be more volatility to that, as I'm sure you're hearing from many of the banks. But ultimately, our longer-dated CRE portfolio of mostly 4- and 5-rated credits requires a bit more provisioning than the 3- to 4-rated well-structured fund banking capital call facilities that we're putting on. So, that should be beneficial to the go-forward provisioning. But we still have to see it and still have to finalize all those models. Got you. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Hey. Good morning, Steve. Wanted to start. What was the capital call on loan growth in the quarter? It was – it approximated $900 million. Okay. And so, it stepped up. Was that a function of line utilization, Eric? That's a bit higher than where you've been running in terms of growth. No. It was mostly new facilities that were put in place. Okay. That were pretty fully drawn. Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of the reduction in CRE loans in the quarter, was that all in multi-family? And how did the renovation portfolio balances change in the quarter? Mostly multi-family. We had two very large loans that helped drive the reduction. We have a $100 million facility and a $104 million facility, where over the few years that we have the loan we weren't able to establish any sort of relationship. And as a result, it – that drove us to have a reduction of nearly $900 million in CRE, which we're very happy about because that was the whole purpose. And the renovation portfolio, Joe, how did the balances there change in the quarter? It was down slightly. Down a bit? Okay. And then, finally, did you guys wrap up? I know you're doing Phase 2 of the deep dive into the multi-family portfolio. Is that done? And what did you learn from that test? We learned that there will be – we find very little effect but we expect very little effect on our portfolio. Okay. Terrific. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you, Steve. The next question is from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Hey. Good morning. Hey, Chris. Eric, I want to go back to the deposit conversation for just a minute. I think, Joe, you mentioned that you could be at the high end of $3 billion to $5 billion, if the momentum continues on deposit growth. I guess, the question is, net balance sheet growth, how much your borrowings are elevated to where they were pre-cycle? What's the right amount of borrowings for the company? And maybe what I'm asking is, like, the $3 billion to $5 billion total asset growth, like, where do you expect to be in that range once you put the pieces together? The right amount of borrowings we believe is about 7%. And we think that we're going to have significant deposit flows. We're going to deploy reductions of borrowings. And we will have loan growth. We expect to have loan growth. Just from the Fund Banking team, we expect upwards of $750 million in growth per quarter. Not including Signature Financial, not including the Venture Banking Group, we'll have somewhere between $750 million and $1 billion a quarter. And that will be all funded by deposits. Okay. And that 7%, that's the proportion of interest-bearing liabilities? Is that the right denominator? Of assets. Yeah, assets. Of assets? Okay. Great. And then, maybe one more, if I could, maybe I missed it. The expenses, I think, last quarter you said kind of mid-teens, kind of, gliding towards that 12%, as you make these investments and grow into them. Any update on that in terms of timing? Yeah. It came in a little bit better this quarter than we anticipated. We still want to stay in, say, a 12% to 16% range to be safe. The fourth quarter will be closer at 16%, hopefully a little better. And then, we'll see it trend down to 10% to 12% by the end of 2020. Great. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. The next question is from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Brock. Good morning. Good morning. On the Specialized Mortgage Servicing Banking Team – I think that's the full title. Obviously tied to a monumental amount of deposits at the former shop, how do you look at recreating that business at Signature? Is it kind of a straight percentage of that jackpot number over a period of years? Or do you have them on kind of a cadence of quarterly deposit generation that you think they can do? How do you think about that? Well, we think about it the way we thought about each of the teams over the last 18 years – almost 19 years is that they're very experienced, they've been with an institution for a long time, the relationship is primarily with them and not with the institution and they'll market themselves that way and deposits will flow, whether it's from the existing institution or from other institutions. I mean, they just – the person that leads that team has been doing it for 26 years. They had over $22 billion in deposits. So, the formula is not – the secret sauce is hiring the right people and we hired – we were able to get the team that we wanted. So, there's no – nothing special other than the team itself. So, how we – to give you an example, we don't necessarily set up a goal for them. We just basically take it on face value that they're going to be able to generate significant amount of deposits based upon the type of clientele they have. And whether it comes in in the fourth quarter or comes in in the first quarter or comes in in 2021, over a series of years, it will happen. And then, a number of, say, $500 million a quarter after these folks have been in place for some period of time would seem reasonable? More than reasonable. Okay. The one thing about this team that differs from the other teams is that, with the other teams and I mean, the 100-or-so that we have who worked very hard to grow their books of businesses, usually, those teams are talking about $5 million to $10 million in deposits, sometimes $20 million in deposits, while the Specialized Mortgage Servicing Banking Team is usually talking about hundreds of millions in deposits. Got it. So, generating $500 million a quarter is right out of the ground. And on the expense growth, was some of that guidance – is this based on an infrastructure need for this team? Or is most of that plumbing in place and it's more just comp? It's more just comp. I mean, that plumbing is essentially in place. We probably had 95% of what they needed. We're already a fairly sizable player in that space. So, it's really just the comp position. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brock. Your next question is from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Lana. I'm just trying to understand more what drove such a strong growth in deposits this quarter since the Mortgage Servicing Team hasn't started contributing yet. Was there a meaningful pickup in short-term escrow deposits this quarter? No. It basically is the 100-or-so banking teams continuing to work hard. We had a quarter – in the second quarter, we had over $900 million in deposits. So, it's not unusual, although it's the best deposit quarter we've had in three years. That's because the competition has been very tough. I'll tell you one area, the EB-5 area. Prior to this quarter, we had 10 straight quarters of decline in EB-5. And it was actually down $1 billion in deposits over those previous 10 quarters. And actually, we were still in the third quarter and actually went up because the government finalized some regulations. And we expect EB-5 to contribute going forward. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful and... In fact, most of – Lana, in fact, most of the growth was core deposit growth. Okay. Fantastic. And can you give us an idea of – in terms of the Mortgage Servicing Banking Team, the deposits that they should be bringing onboard? Can you give us an idea of, like, what the average rates would be on those types of deposits just for modeling purposes? Yeah. They're going to have – initially, they're going to be bringing over the excess funds of our clients. So, those rates will be, I'd say, around 2% now, maybe a little under that. But over time, they're going to start to garner more of the operating accounts and those are non-interest-bearing. So, they should get to a very high level of non-interest-bearing to overall deposits. To be safe, between 30% and 50% of their overall should be in DDA. So that should meaningfully bring down their overall deposit costs. But initially, they're going to bring – bringing over the higher cost interest-bearing deposits first. Those are the easiest to move. Okay. Got it. And just one more question, if I could, on the commercial real estate multi-family. Given where rates are – and I don't know if you've changed your multi-family pricing recently, I don't think you had up until a while ago. How do you keep your balances flat going forward when, sort of, transaction volumes have really got ground to a halt with rent reform and you're seeing a lot of competition in this space with pricing? Well, when we – during the third quarter, when we were reducing the portfolio, our pricing was about 50 basis points above that of our competition. Now, in the fourth quarter, it's back to the norm which is usually about 25 basis points higher, where we're able to keep the book that we have and attract a little bit of the business that's transacting out there. So, it's really a matter of keeping what we have. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, David. Good morning, David. We've talked a lot about some of the recent teams and the hires and, sort of, new business lines. What is your appetite at this point to add to the fund services and the venture capital teams? Well, I mean, they're fairly new. So, they have been adding a person here and there to fill in this – the opening that they need to. Our appetite would be fine if we could find, as Tom Byrne says, all-stars out there. Got it. And as far as the build-out on the West Coast, where does that stand at this point and, again, your appetite to still add people there? Yeah. We were fully built out there. We have four traditional banking teams. We also have representation from the venture team with one banking division. And Kathy Kanno Wood is out there with a few others who runs our Specialized Mortgage Banking Services (sic) [Servicing] Team. So, we're actively looking to hire more traditional banking teams there. And we anticipate that probably next year or now – it's getting a little bit late in the year for us to add, but we'll probably look at teams there next year. I mean, our appetite is that – is such that we would open up an office in Los Angeles, if we found the right team. Got it, got it. Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.

         "Good day and welcome to the County Bancorp, Inc. Earnings Release Third Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Schneider, President of County Bank. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2019. As a reminder, we have our disclaimer on the use of forward-looking statements in our slide deck, which we currently have shown on the webcast. I'll start with some comments on asset quality, which is on slide 3. We're encouraged at the current level of milk prices. A year ago, forward CME class III milk prices were in the $15 to $16 range. We are now seeing forward milk prices in the $16 to $18 range. The improved milk prices were a contributor in the upgrading of one dairy ag relationship, which improved our adverse asset coverage ratio to 45.67% this quarter. As you can see from our slide, there does appear to be a good correlation between milk price and our adverse asset coverage ratio. We are having positive conversations related to one substandard performing loan and a few of our OREO properties which we hope will allow us to lower this ratio again in quarter four. We also upgraded another dairy relationship from special mention to watch. The decrease in loans rated substandard performing and special mention allowed us to book a $1.2 million credit to provision for loan losses this quarter. We allocate higher general reserves for loans rated watch, special mention, and substandard performing in our allowance for loan loss calculation. We expect that the current milk price levels will continue to lower the dollar amount of loans rated watch and worse into 2020, which could continue to lower our reserve levels. We are currently 92% of the way through our annual reviews of watch and worse credits. Since we prioritize higher dollar relationships in our annual reviews, it should not have any material impact in the credit quality ratios or allowance levels. We continue to see overall stability in Wisconsin farmland values, which continues to contribute positively to the strength of our credit portfolio. We are in the process of updating our capital plan during fourth quarter, and we'll begin to evaluate a stock buyback plan for 2020, with continued positive trends in milk prices and our adverse asset coverage ratio. I will now turn it over to Glen. Thanks, Tim. Morning, everybody. As we announced during our fourth quarter 2018 conference call, we continued to deleverage our balance sheet by continuing to use loan participation sales with servicing income attached. Now this has allowed us to continue to maintain profitability while continuing to improve the funding mix in the right side of our balance sheet. We increased loans sold and serviced by $41 million this quarter. Loan servicing income this quarter grew to $1.7 million and loan servicing right origination income grew to $1.7 million. That $1.7 million of loan servicing right origination income included $250,000 of servicing right valuation allowance, which will continue one more quarter in Q4. This combined with $19 million in client deposit growth allowed us to continue to reduce wholesale funding by $97 million this quarter. We're really pleased with the change in our funding mix. Wholesale funding is now down $224 million and client deposits are up $100 million year-over-year. Our wholesale funding now represents 28% of total funding, compared to 41% year-over-year. We will look to grow our loan balances over the next year, but this will be governed by our growth in client deposits. We would target a 4% to 5% growth rate. We are still very focused on relationship lending at profitable pricing. Our net interest margin increased during the quarter due to increasing loan yield and flattening funding costs. Because of our asset sensitivity and 33% of our loan portfolio being adjustable, we do expect to see some slight margin compression in Q4. We have been able to offset the impact of rate cuts in the loan portfolio with aggressive cuts to interest rates paid on our client deposits. For example, our rate on – for money market accounts with $100,000 and more has dropped from 1.95% at the end of June to 1.26% currently. Our one-year CD has dropped from 2.05% to 1.65% during that same time period. We haven't seen much in the way of client deposit outflows from a rate cutting date, but we'll have to be watchful of that as competition either increases or decreases. And now I'd like to open it up for questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Brendan Nosal with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you? Morning, Brendan. Hi, Brendan. Good. I just want to start off on the expense base here. Thinking back to last quarter, if I recall correctly, we were thinking a run rate of around $7.2 million was kind of the expectation for the back half of the year, and then obviously things were a bit higher this quarter after backing out the FDIC benefit. Can you just help us understand what you expect for expense in the final quarter of the year and then heading into 2020? Yeah. Brendan, this is Glen. So, one of the things that popped out is on employee compensation and benefits, we started to ratchet up our incentive comp because we're hitting a lot of our targets this year. So we ramped that up from the quarter. I think employee compensation and benefits could go up above $500,000 from where you see that level. The other level should be, I think, trending kind of similarly to what that was this quarter. So, one of the contributors to employee compensation and benefits as we've started to fill some key positions we've been looking for, one on the treasury side and one on our concierge banking side. Again, a lot of it's just tied to us continuing to make sure we can be thoughtful about how we grow client deposits. Okay. So just to make sure I understand correctly, so I guess if you kind of add back or rather remove the FDIC benefit and then add another $500,000 of incentive comp that kind of gets you around like $8.2 million to $8.3 million expense overall for the fourth quarter? Yes. That sounds about right. Okay. All right. And I think, as of right now, we're just starting our budgeting process now. So, going into 2020, I think that should probably be a good level too. We'll obviously update folks as we start to get through our budget process. Got it. Great. And then moving on to the net interest margin, there's a comment in the slide deck that you might see a little bit of compression in the fourth quarter of 2019. Could you just help size up what that might look like, and then will there be further pressure if the Fed continues to cut rates? Yes. I think it's maybe 1% to 2% at worst, I think, compression. I mean, we are seeing the loan yields start to – as we look month by month in the third quarter, we did see some pressure on loan yields. But we were – again, we were pretty aggressive on cutting rates to try to get ahead of this. Part of it's just because we have lot of – we had a lot of excess cash and we're trying to be cognizant of not paying up too much on rate on the deposit side. So we've been very successful with that. And again, we haven't seen any outflows. So, if I'm looking at it – like I said, I think a 1% and 2% at worst would be what I'd be looking at. Okay, great. And then final... When I say 1% or 2%, I'm talking about the rate, so the net interest margin rate. Meaning basis points or... Yeah. Yeah. ...percent of the total – okay. All right. Good. And then final one for me before I step back, just top level, I mean, milk prices have obviously improved a great deal, and the forward outlook is better. I mean, if milk prices hold near here for the next 12 months, and I know that's a big guess, but I mean, how much reduction hypothetically could you see in overall problem asset levels? Well, I think if we continue to see this kind of current milk price level, we're hopeful that we can get under the 40%, maybe into the mid-30s. That's just a guess at this point. But at this level, most, if not all, of our dairy farmers are in a profitable level, and the futures market is pointing to at least continued solid milk prices through the end of next year. Yeah. Hey, Brendan. Got it. It was interesting. We've added something to the slide deck, milk price versus the adverse asset coverage ratio. And you can see the kind of correlation there. So, again, if we continue to see where milk price is at this level, we think we can get that, again, under the 40% or down to the 30% level, so – 30% I mean. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. Our next question comes from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Good morning. Morning, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. So first question is, I believe the bank recently underwent a regulatory exam, without giving away too much, can you give us a sense as to how that went? Tim, do you want to go ahead first? I think it went pretty well. Obviously, our adverse asset coverage ratio is moving in the right direction, which they were pleased to see. They continue to compliment us in the way that we're managing through this cycle, managing our ag credits, and how we're on top of them as well. I mean, they were pleased with our continued kind of wholesale reduction on the right side of the balance sheet and more core deposits. And obviously, milk prices at this point have helped our overall ag portfolio to heal a little bit, so that's positive news for all of us. Yeah. That's great. And then as far as – we've been reading about negative weather issues impacting farmers. Are you guys – are your farmers seeing any of that in Wisconsin  in a while (00:11:25)? Yeah. It's been a little more challenging at this point for harvest because of the continued rainfall. And it's creating a little bit more work for them, probably a little more expense relative to trying to get the corn out of the field in particular, but I think most of them had made headways and little windows that they've had here in between the rain showers. So, we hope that it'll hold off a little bit and they'll be able to get the balance of the crop harvested. We're a little bit behind the harvest at this point, but we've got some time left here yet. And then lastly, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that land values continue to improve. Are there regions within Wisconsin that you see that are doing much better than others and then what are those regions? Yeah. I'd say it depends upon where you are, but the east central part of the state where the bank is located, our headquarters in Manitowoc is a very strong dairy area, and there still seems to be decent competition for land. You get into the kind of the northern parts of the state, it's maybe less competitive. I'd say that the southern two-thirds of the state overall are still pretty solid from a land value standpoint. You're not seeing a ton of softening anywhere. It's just there isn't maybe as much competition for the land in the northern third of the state. Excellent. Thank you very much. Thanks, Kevin. Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead. Morning, guys. Good morning, Terry. Morning. Glen, maybe just to start with you. I'm just trying to understand the size of the balance sheet and earning assets in fourth quarter and beyond. I know you talk about client deposit growth target, 4% to 5%. Was that – what type of timeframe was there and how should we just think about kind of the runoff of wholesale deposits, increase in core deposits, and then what you do on the asset side as that mix changes? Yeah. I think the 4% to 5% is probably more our loan growth target, Terry. We're targeting a little bit higher on the client deposit side to stay ahead of that and just maintain liquidity. So, client deposits, I would say, is probably in that 6% range. We're going to continue to hammer on the wholesale funding. It probably won't be as aggressive as we've had been in the last year, but we're still going to continue to drive that down. I think, long term, we want to get it kind of in that 5% to 10% level compared to where we're at today, but that's still going to take some time. So, as you think about 2020, do you expect the balance sheet to stabilize, grow from here? I would say client deposits and loans are going to grow. I'd say we're going to continue to hash away at wholesale, again, but not to the level today. So, total assets may be up a little, but again, we're going to focus on growing the kind of core relationships on the loan and deposit side. And then a question on the loan servicing right origination, the $1.74 million in the quarter... Yeah. ...you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, there'll be another $250,000 gain on the loan servicing rights, which makes sense. What happens in 2020 and, I guess, what are your thoughts in that line, ex the rights, mortgage servicing rights in the fourth quarter? Yeah. So, fourth quarter, we just had so much in sales this quarter that usually what happens is we have more modest sales, so the amortization of that really kind of offsets the origination volume. But because the origination volume was so high this last quarter, I would think that that kind of levels off. We may have a little bit of income, but I don't think it will be as aggressive as it was this quarter for sure. Okay. And then the last question, I understand upgrade in substandard performing, special mentions down, and just feeling better about dairy overall. Just from reading the headlines around some of your customers, NAFTA deal, I guess hasn't been kind of signed and isn't a done deal yet. But, yeah, we had the releasing of the reserve. And is that – I guess my question is, is that just the internal formulas that you have spits out the reserve releasing despite maybe the uncertainty that's still out there in the marketplace, particularly to your dairy-related borrowers? Yeah. And Tim can jump in after I'd comment, Terry, but the way we look at it is milk price kind of drives loan grading, but land values, that governs impairments. So I think there's a lot of things going on. I think there is some optimism in the marketplace on milk. Supplies are regulating now. They're down from where they used to be at all-time highs a year or two ago. So there's a lot of positive momentum. I think the trade agreements will definitely help sustain this kind of uptick in milk price, but everything that we're seeing and reading is that folks are not overly optimistic about milk price, but we think it's going to – we think it's in a good spot and could hold for the immediate future. And Tim can kind of jump in on his thought there, too, but... Yeah. And we're definitely consistent with our application of how we apply our allowance for loan loss. We don't want to be jumping around, and we've taken some hits in the past and increases in loan loss because of milk prices and some of our challenges with our ag portfolio. But, overall, as we've mentioned many times before, again, our heavy use of the FSA guarantees really kind of minimizes our loan loss exposure, and obviously some of the improvements with the milk prices now, and I think if milk prices stay here, we should continue to see similar improvement in our classified assets, which will probably drive down our need for loan loss longer term. Great. That's good to hear. Thanks, guys. Yeah. Our next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Morning, Brian. Hey, Brian. Hey, just one question going back to the margin, just if you – I know – I appreciate the color on this fourth quarter and just one – a rate cut. But I guess if you were to see multiple cuts from here, let's say you get two or three more cuts, I guess do you – I guess can you just give any thought on how you think the margin behaves kind of in that scenario, if you were to get one in October and another December and early next year? Does the pressure begin to alleviate the more cuts you get, or just any color on just multiple cuts? Yeah. So, we do have a very short loan portfolio. The duration on it, it's about a year and it's driven largely by the ag side. So, we keep getting rate cuts. I mean, it is going to be hard for us to maintain margin, especially if there's like one a quarter, that's when it gets a little challenging, I think, for us. But again, I'd say, we're being very aggressive again on the deposit side, or as aggressive as we can be. So, it's going to be hard for us to maintain margin levels if we get more than one. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And I guess maybe just one other question, you guys mentioned the buyback. I mean, I guess, are there certain hurdles you would have to kind of hit to make it more likely you would – you get on that road, or I guess just what are kind of the key elements you're looking at to make that decision on the buyback and how to utilize that, or if you utilize it? Yeah. I mean, I think we've been consistent when we're out on the road talking to folks. It's really governed by two things, milk price holding kind of where these levels are, and secondarily, getting our classified ratio under 50%. And we've kind of used the hurdle of – and again, there's no magic behind this, but if we get the classified ratio under 50% for two quarters straight, and we feel good about milk prices, I think we feel a lot better about kind of utilizing some of our excess cash to start buying some stock back. So, it's something we're – it's definitely on our radar and on our plate to discuss with our board here this quarter and hopefully have some more guidance on that as we get into the first quarter of next year. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then just the last one or two for me, just the watch list, Glen, it looked like it was up. I mean, I guess the trends sound great with the milk pricing, but just the watch list looked like it was up a little bit linked quarters. Is there something in that number? Is that just an anomaly the way those trends were this quarter? Did I look at that wrong in the slide deck? Well, it's really a product of all the upgrades that we've had discussed moving out of the classified bucket, and one big deal that moved from special mention into watch and trending in the right direction. So that's why that number is up substantially. Okay. All right. Thanks, Tim. And just the comment you made about prices, maybe I'm just confused. I'm trying to understand it. When you say that prices of milk get better. If they're getting better, how that affects the adversely classified ratio versus just hold – the price holding its own. The loans you continue to look at as far as the rating and that's what's driving it? Just how to think about that adversely classified ratio if the milk prices kind of stabilize here versus if it gets better. Well, I think if milk prices stay where they're at right now when we get through the review cycle of the vast majority of our credits in that bucket into early first quarter and second quarter of 2020, we should see some upgrades because they're going to have a stronger 2019 because of better milk prices the last two-thirds of the year. And then if the projected milk prices moving forward continue to stay at least at this level or maybe if we get some trade deals done move up, we should see similar positive movement in that classified ratio. Brian... Okay. ...and another way to look at it is that we start the annual review process probably starting in late first quarter, but I think you'll see probably more material movements probably in second quarter of next year. We may see some upgrades in the fourth quarter this year and first of next year. But I think a lot of it could come in the second quarter. I got you. Okay. And would you just remind me, Glen, when you guys look at the process to upgrade a credit, it looks like kind of reading some of the comments here that some of that's done intra-quarter, but I mean – or is it more traditionally done when you get an annual  view (00:22:40)? So, to your point, maybe the second quarter is when you start to see it more or it sounds like you're upgrading intra-quarter as opposed to – or intra-year as opposed to just annually. Is that fair? Just how to think about that. We may do that selectively and we have done it selectively on certain deals. But I'd say the vast majority of the movement's going to occur once we get through the review cycle late first quarter and in the second quarter next year. But there are certain deals that we feel have made significant improvement that are maybe still in that substandard bucket which is what you saw in this last quarter. And as we watch them closely and see certain things change, we aren't afraid to make some of those moves intra-quarter. Brian, as you're looking at the – we've got about $9 million in special mention. There's probably maybe $2 million to $3 million of that that could move here in the fourth quarter. The rest of it could move maybe first quarter. That's kind of an up or out category. It's not meant to be a permanent category. Yeah. We're watching those pretty – just like all of the watch and worse, we're watching them closely. But I guess that we may see a little bit of movement fourth quarter, but hopefully first quarter, we'll see the rest of it, and we're optimistic. Again, we're watching them pretty closely. Okay. All right. I think just the last one for me, Glen, that wholesale target, I thought you guys were at – was it 28% you were at this quarter? Yeah. I mean, did you say – I guess the longer-term target was, what, 5% to 10%? Well, yeah, I'm mixing it up, Brian. So the 5% to 10% is probably more as a percentage of assets. Okay. That 28% is just mixed pure – it's just the funding mix based on... Yeah. ...to funding that asset. So sorry to confuse the two topics. Yeah. Understood. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Brian. Our next question is a follow-up from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Yes. Tim or Glen, could you remind us what the breakeven price level for milk is for farmers? Is it around $16, if I recall? Yeah. I still think it's in that $16, $16.50 range, something like that. So at least that's – if you've averaged it out through our entire portfolio, that's about where the breakeven point is for our book. Yeah, that's what I thought. And then just going back to the regulatory exam, was that FDIC or was that OCC? FDIC and state. FDIC and state. Great. Thank you. Our next question is also a follow-up from Brendan Nosal with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Hey. So it looks like you're working on an update to the stress testing model that you guys ran last year. I'm just kind of curious as to the thought process behind that. I mean, the last test showed that you had plenty of capital, and since then, milk prices have improved and you haven't taken any dairy losses since that. So, is it just to convey added comfort with the state of the portfolio? Yeah. I mean, there's a definite expectation by regulators for anybody that's got a concentration like ours that we do more modeling around stress testing, whether it's risk rating migration and/or just overall capital stress testing. So, we just – we think it's an important tool for us to make sure that we can kind of watch where we're at on the risk migration cycle, but it's also just a good capital planning tool for us to establish what we think we have and establish our capital policy limits, too, Brendan. So it's something we think is really important. We're working hard to get better data as part of this. We do provide loan-level data for this, but the collateral data has been not as good as we'd like. So we're working hard to get that better  and tweaked (00:26:44) to get – to even get better color around this. Understood. All right. Well, thanks for the question, and congrats on a good quarter. Thank you. Thanks, Bren. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tim Schneider for any closing remarks. I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning. And we're excited about the strong quarter that we've had and the continued outlook for the dairy space, which is important to us, and feel like we're headed in a positive direction here. So again, thank you all for joining us. And we'll – if there are any follow-up questions, please feel free to call Glen or I, and we'd be happy to answer your questions. Thank you. Thanks, all. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, everyone, and welcome to Bladex's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call on this 18th day of October 2019. This call is being recorded and is for investors and analysts only. If you are a member of the media, you are invited to listen-only. Bladex has prepared a PowerPoint presentation to accompany their discussion. It is available through the webcast and on the bank's corporate website at www.bladex.com. Joining us today are Mr. Gabriel Tolchinsky, Chief Executive Officer; and Mrs. Ana Graciela de Méndez, Chief Financial Officer. Their comments will be based on the earnings release, which was issued earlier today and is available on the corporate website. The following statement is made pursuant to the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements described in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In these communications, we make certain statements that are forward-looking, such as statements regarding Bladex's future results, plans and anticipated trends in the markets affecting its results and financial condition. These forward-looking statements are Bladex's expectations on the day of the initial broadcast of this conference call, and Bladex does not undertake to update these expectations based on subsequent events or knowledge. Various risks, uncertainties and assumptions are detailed in the bank's press releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from results expressed or implied in these communications. And with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mr. Tolchinsky for his presentation. Thanks, Shontelle. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before Ana Graciela delves into key aspects of our earnings results for the third quarter, I would like to discuss with you important developments that took place during the quarter and the impact of these recent developments on our perception of risks and financial results. I will address the global macroeconomic context, the economic and business environment in Latin America, and relevant country and industry-specific developments affecting our portfolio. During our last four quarters' conference calls, we mentioned that the credit quality of our portfolio, cost structure and allowances for expected credit losses set the pace for our earnings generation capacity. Our third quarter 2019 results are another step in that direction. The global economy in 2019 is on course for its weakest year of growth since the financial crisis, weighed down by tensions that have significantly slowed international trade. Although growth is now expected to fall 3% this year, according to new estimates from the International Monetary Fund, down from an estimated 3.2% in July. The IMF attributed the slowdown primarily to rising trade barriers that have impacted manufacturing and investment around the world. The IMF now forecasts that world trade volumes will expand by just 1.1% this year, less than half of the growth rate of a July estimate of 2.5%. For 2019, forecast for US economic growth were cut by 0.2% to 2.4%. Forecast for the Euro area were cut by 0.1% to 1.2%, and China's economic growth was lowered by 0.1% to 6.1% from their last July report. Shockingly, the IMF expects slower economic growth in 90% of the world. Given this macroeconomic context, we are once again downgraded our economic and trade growth expectations for Latin America for 2019. Today, we are expecting only a 0.2% economic growth for the region, down from 0.6% at the end of the second quarter. And trade is expected to grow only 1%, down from 2.6%. This tepid growth prospect masks significant disparities in economic performance between countries. Large countries like Mexico and Argentina are experiencing uncertainties and lower foreign investment flows, a key driver of economic growth. On the other hand, countries like Colombia and Brazil are showing a pickup in consumer demand that is supporting their economies, despite low commodity prices and weak international trade. In other words, slow or no growth from the developed world, and the consequences of protectionist measures on trade and commodity prices are having an uneven impact on the region, with some countries better prepared to withstand the prevailing environment. Brazil, the region's largest economy, is a bright spot amongst the three largest countries, with growth expectations of 0.8%. Mexico is expected to grow only 0.3%, and Argentina is in an outright crisis; its economy expected to shrink 2.9%. We will discuss Argentina in more depth later in the call. Although Brazil will grow significantly less than we expected at the beginning of the year, we are seeing some of the economic growth drivers stabilizing and starting to show some improvement. Both consumer demand and investment are showing signs of life. Both categories had sizable declines in 2015 and 2016 and had barely recovered since. With policies aimed at opening up the economy, such as an aggressive privatization program and the passage of pension reform, we are optimistic on Brazilian economic growth and business opportunities there. We see medium-term risks in Mexico, resulting from the prospect of potential interference in state-owned entities that, for the last 20 years, were run independently and professionally. That said, we see three clear short-term priorities from the current administration that should keep Mexico on the relatively good side of the rating agencies. One is maintaining a small primary fiscal surplus; two, continued support for Pemex in restoring production; and three, keeping a good relationship with the US. Our base scenario is that Mexico will not be downgraded to below investment grade until 2021. As such, we maintain a short-term profile of 10 months of average life in our Mexico portfolio. The Andean corridor stands out, with Chile, Peru and Colombia all exhibiting good growth prospects. Although growth expectations for both Chile and Peru have been downgraded because of lower commodity prices, expectations for economic growth in Colombia have improved on the basis of macro stability and a regeneration of consumer demand. We are increasing exposure to these countries in our portfolio. Most of Central America and the Caribbean continue to show solid economic growth prospects, although these have also been downgraded recently on the back of lower commodity prices for their exports. We continue to pay close attention to the economic performance of Ecuador and to the political ramifications of the implementation of its IMF program. The current Ecuadorian administration seems to want to follow through with this program, but with basically zero economic growth, the contractionary elements of the IMF prescriptions, such as the elimination of fuel subsidies, are encountering strong opposition from political groups. Costa Rica is also in our closely monitoring category. In particular, we're following the impact of the fiscal reform package passed a few months ago. Costa Rica has a sizeable fiscal deficit. Fiscal reforms, mostly an increase in value-added tax, took many years and several iterations to be finally approved. These were aimed at reducing the primary fiscal deficit, which would then lower financing rate that exacerbate the overall fiscal imbalance. When the package was passed, we spoke about the rating agency's skepticism on the magnitude and potential effectiveness of the reforms. It's too early to tell and we have a long way to overcome a larger than 6% of GDP deficit, but September was the first month of primary fiscal surplus in years. Argentina, what can I say? Have we seen this movie before? Disappointment over the primary election results, which gave the leftist populist candidate a significant lead going into the general election, resulted in a run on the currency and the re-profiling of some of the country's debt. Argentinians demanded US dollars, preferably in physical notes, at a rate that was fast depleting the Central Bank's low available reserve levels. After some currency controls, interest rates north of 80% and a few planes with physical cash from the US, the Argentine government managed to temporarily control the situation. But with a debt to GDP ratio approaching 90%, very few available reserves and constant demand for hard currency, Argentina remains in critical condition. We will not make predictions on the outcome of next week's general election or the economic policies that a Fernández-Fernández administration would pursue. What is clear to us is that the country will remain very reliant on the US dollar income it can generate from its main export commodities. Whoever wins the election, they will likely maintain open trade and trade-related currency lines and continue to promote the development of oil and natural gas-rich Vaca Muerta shale for the eventual export of hydrocarbons. As you'll hear from Ana Graciela, we have reduced our exposure to Argentina and are very comfortable with our book concentrated in strategic industries and US dollar generators. We continue to believe that the current macroeconomic context offers no room for complacency. Furthermore, the combination of slow growth and risk aversion is exacerbating liquidity for the top names in the region, compressing their margins, not always compensating for the risk these credits represent. Against this backdrop, we continue to analyze the risk/reward function at the country level to adjust the portfolio accordingly and maintain a very vigilant credit underwriting posture. As we mentioned in previous calls, 76 of our Commercial Portfolio has less than one year of remaining life. Bladex is in a privileged position to dynamically adjust portfolio exposures. We see growth opportunities in Brazil, Central America and the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay and Chile. This balances out reduction in exposure to Argentina. Bladex is all about consistency in a challenging and changing context. Our book of business is solid. We are identifying new prospects. We are increasing share of wallet with our existing client base and our structuring value-added transactions with key clients. Although our focus on high-quality borrowers and persistent US dollar liquidity in key markets put some pressure on our origination margin, Bladex has been able to maintain relatively stable margins. Our pipeline of syndicated and structured transactions tied to Latin American integration is also solid and should help us continue to increase the exposure we look for in our medium-term loan portfolio, as well as increase our fee income. Deposits, particularly from our Class A shareholders, represent 62% of our funding structure. We appreciate the trust and commitment of the region's central bank and the impact that these deposits have in improving our cost of funds. On the cost side, expenses for the quarter continue to be under control. As you'll hear from Ana Graciela, our credit impaired loans experienced a slight decrease from last quarter, as well as a reduction in our watch list category. Our credit reserve coverage in Tier 1 capital ratio remains strong and our book value remains solid, above $25 a share. That is why our board of directors approved to maintain a $0.385 a share dividend for the quarter. Against this backdrop, the management of Bladex, as well as its board of directors, is cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2019 and look for a continuation of the profitability path we embarked on in the last four quarters. With these brief comments, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ana Graciela, to provide you with more color about our financial performance in the third quarter 2019. Thank you, Gabriel. Good morning. I will now go over the third quarter and year-to-date 2019 results into more detail, making reference to the presentation uploaded on our website. So on page 4, profit for the third quarter of 2019 totaled $20.4 million or $0.52 per share, compared to a $40.7 million loss in the third quarter of 2018 when the bank recorded impairment losses on financial and non-financial instruments, totaling $60 million, mostly related to impaired credit. Third quarter 2019 profits were down 8% on a quarter-on-quarter basis on account of decreased structuring and syndication fees and lower net interest income. Profit for the first nine months of 2019 totaled $64 million compared to a $9.6 million loss a year ago. During the first nine months of 2019, the bank has maintained a relatively stable level of top line revenue, which increased by 2% with respect to the same period of 2018; improved efficiency, with a 20% reduction in operating expenses, achieving a 31% efficiency ratio; and sustained high quality portfolio origination, evidenced by a substantial decrease of credit provision, which totaled $2.4 million for the period. On page 5, net interest income for the third quarter of 2019 was down 2% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter on lower average loan portfolio balances, which decreased by 3% quarter-on-quarter and by 5% year-on-year to $5.3 billion. Lower average portfolio balances during the quarter reflect reduced exposure in Argentina, coupled with lower credit demand from certain countries in the Central America and Caribbean region, partly offset by increased high quality loan origination in countries like Chile and Colombia toward the end of the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter decrease in net interest income was also impacted by a 4-basis point decrease in net interest margin to 1.77%, mostly related to the effect of decreasing LIBOR-based market rate on the bank's asset and liability interest rate gap position. For the first nine months of 2019, the bank's net interest income increased by 1% year-on-year to $82.6 million and the net interest margin increased by 3 basis points to 1.77%, mostly reflecting the benefits from an increasing market rate environment throughout most of the period compared to the year before. Now moving on to page 6. Fees and commission totaled $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2019, representing a decrease of 24% year-on-year and of 45% quarter-on-quarter, mainly on account of lower fees from closed transactions in the structuring and syndication business. Year-to-date, fees from the business remained stable at close to $3 million, while total fees fell 13% to $10.3 million due to reduced revenues from letters of credit. From pages 7 through 9, we present the evolution and composition of our Commercial Portfolio. At September 30, 2019 Commercial Portfolio totaled $6.2 billion, representing a stable level quarter-on-quarter and a 1% decrease year-on-year. Total Commercial Portfolio continued to be mostly short term with 76% maturing in the next 12 months and an average remaining tenure of close to 11 months. More than half of the bank's short-term Commercial Portfolio is specifically trade related. Financial institutions, sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns represented 71% of total Commercial Portfolio as of September 30, 2019. Aside from financial institutions, the largest industry exposure accounting for 55% of the total, the other relevant industry sector in our portfolio is oil and gas, both integrated and downstream, with a combined total of 12% of total Commercial Portfolio. The remaining exposure is well-diversified among several industries with no sector exceeding 5%. Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile represented the highest country exposures together totaling 55% of total Commercial Portfolio. While Brazil and Mexico remained relatively stable at 17% and 14%, respectively, we were able to increase our portfolio in Colombia to 13% and Chile to 11% on our continuous effort to optimize risk/reward opportunities in high quality countries. Exposure in Argentina was reduced to 4% of the total portfolio as we continue to execute on our plan to reduce the exposure in the country in view of the macroeconomic, political and foreign exchange rate volatility. 84% of our exposure in the country is with exporting, state-owned and private corporations with US solar generation capacity. The remaining 16% is with banks. Central America and the Caribbean remain a relevant regional exposure to the bank at 26% of the total, mostly focused in top tier banks, sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns, accounting for 65% of the exposure in that region. The remaining 35% is with top tier private local corporations, which are leaders in their respective industries and with regional players or multilatinas. On page 10, credit impaired loans or NPLs totaled $61.8 million, down $2.9 million from the previous quarter, related to the sale of an exposure that was 100% reserved. In this transaction, the bank collected $0.5 million and the remaining $2.4 million were written off against existing reserve. At September 30, 2019, NPLs represented 1.11% of total loans, with a reserve coverage of 1.7 times and accounted for a single client exposure in Brazil, with an IFRS 9 Stage 3 individually allocated allowance of 88%, reflecting a book value of around $8 million. Stage 2 exposure decreased by $55 million during the quarter, mostly due to repayments of scheduled maturities on our watch list portfolio. Credit reserves allocated to these Stage 2 exposure increased by $3 million, impacted by downgrades on internal client ratings. All of the exposure in this category remains current. Origination in our Stage 1 portfolio increased by $66 million, while the related credit reserves decreased by $2 million, reflecting improved quality on the increased portfolio origination in countries like Chile and Colombia. This Stage 1 exposure, which relates to the performing portfolio with credit conditions unchanged since origination, continued to be the most relevant, with 95% of total exposure at quarter end. On page 11, third quarter 2019 expenses amounted to $9 million, representing a decrease of 17% year-on-year and of 15% quarter-on-quarter. During this third quarter, we recorded an expense level somewhat below the run rate of expenses recorded in recent quarters, which should partially revert in coming quarters. Nonetheless, the bank's sustained effort and focus on expense control and process improvement has been affected, evidenced by the decrease in trending expenses and efficiency level below 31%, both on a quarterly and on a year-to-date basis. For the first nine months of 2019, expenses were down 20% from the year before, totaling $29.4 million. This reduction mostly relates to lower salary base and other employee-related expenses resulting from the personnel restructuring process in the first half of 2018. Reductions in other expenses partly relate to the adoption of IFRS 16 during 2019 whereby the bank's office space lease expenses are now accounted for as depreciation and interest expense. Other expenses were also reduced on the absence of extraordinary charges recorded in 2018, as well as other cost savings across the organization. On page 12, we present our capital return, with a positive trend in ROE reaching 8% for the quarter and 8.5% year-to-date, on a sustained level of capitalization above 21% at quarter end. Total shareholder return was supported, like Gabby mentioned, by the quarterly dividend payment announced today, with the board cap at $0.385 per share, representing a 75% payout ratio over quarterly earnings. I will now turn the call back to Gabriel to open the Q&A session. Thank you. Thank you, Ana Graciela. Shontelle, why don't we open up the Q&A session? Thank you. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we would like to open the floor for questions.  Our first question will come from Robert Tate, Global Rational Capital. Hi, Gabriel and Ana. Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could just elaborate on what factors you think may lead to an improvement in the net interest rate over time. Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. What we see from – and I'm going to go approach this from a top down perspective – is a very challenging global and regional environment in which we have to be very diligent and careful with respect to our credit underwriting. And we are in a happy position to be able to maintain our credit spreads where they are. We are looking for value-added transactions with key customers, and that is essentially what should be able to make us sustain those credit spreads on a go-forward basis. We are identifying some opportunities, as we mentioned, in the Andean region, in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru, and I think that we are about to see more opportunities, particularly in Brazil. It's very difficult as of yet to determine the potential there but we see very good signs, starting with the fact that they are opening up their economy with an aggressive privatization program. And very importantly, as it relates to the impact on overall credit demand, is the fact that this administration is not keen on maintaining the subsidy that previous administrations had with respect to the involvement of National Development Bank in lending to industry as a whole. So, as we see the privatization program progressing, we should see credit demand go up. And if the private sector is the one that needs to fulfill this credit demand, that should be a good sign in terms of margin improvement, particularly given that short-term rates in Brazil have come down to a very low historical level. The SELIC rate right now is about 5.5%, and we believe that that should stimulate credit demand growth, and we could see a pickup in margins as the private sector banks start fulfilling that demand for credit. Right. All right. Thank you very much. And just noting that your Tier 1 Basel III capital ratio is quite high at 21%, do you see the opportunity to make use of more leverage over time? And you mentioned that you're optimistic for the business over the remainder of 2019, do you think that a return on equity of closer to 10% is achievable in, say, the next 12 months, in light of your optimism? 12% continues to be our goal on a long-term basis, but we will grow exposure, portfolio leverage on what we consider to be a prudent and solid credit underwriting strategy. And as such, we will approach it opportunity by opportunity. And as you well know, we don't give projections on how our different ratios will evolve over time, but we are very happy with our portfolio, we're very happy with our capacity to maintain relatively stable margins and we continue to find good opportunities to deploy our capital. If it's okay, we should open it up for more questions, if there are any. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Our next question will come from Robert Maltbie, Singular Research. Hello, Gabriel. I'm here for Jim Marrone today. Wanted to ask you a little bit about the impact of the rate cuts in the US on the short-term Fed funds, et cetera, and the trends there, and how you see that impacting your forward margins. Thank you, Robert. That is a very good question. And let me start with saying that, of course, lower US dollar interest rates will have an impact on our margins. That said, we believe that we will be able to maintain our margins with incremental origination exposure on a go-forward basis and be able to counteract that. Now, for a more granular perspective, let me turn it over to Ana Graciela to answer. Thank you, Gabriel. Hi, Robert. Yes. Hi. As we have mentioned before – hello – with respect to our interest rate gap position, like I mentioned, in this particular quarter, we were negatively impacted because of the decrease in rate environment, but that should correct because we are usually able to – I mean, we have a very short tenure book both in our asset and liability side. So, with respect to the re-pricing, we don't see a continuous deterioration there. On the contrary, we should benefit from also lower rates on our funding side, which eventually, what happened in this particular quarter is that because of the way we were positioned, our lending book re-priced a little quicker, but that should correct itself in the coming quarter. So with that perspective, we – in the overall, even in increasing or decreasing rate environment, the bank is able to re-price its assets and liabilities within a short period of time. And yes, I mean, the lower rates at the end of the day, with the high capital balance that we have, obviously, has an impact on the return of that capital invested in our assets. Thank you. A follow-up question on operating expenses. Looks like you've done a very good job reducing your operating expenses. And I'm wondering, in terms of that trend over the next 12 months, do you see that ability to continue or remain about even or just a little bit of color on that? Well, like Gabby mentioned, we don't necessarily give prospects of our figures. Going forward, what I can tell you is we are seeing the average trend in the recent quarters at about $10.2 million, $10.5 million, and that is what we call today the run rate of expenses, understanding that during the fourth quarter, we may see some cyclical impacts on expenses. But if you see the year overall, we should be around $10.5 million in quarterly expenses on average. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any final remarks. Thank you very much, Shontelle, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you guys again when we issue results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019. In the meantime, for any questions, we always remain open and available. Thank you very much and have a good day. Thank you. Good day. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this now concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the week. Thank you."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the First Financial Bancorp's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Scott Crawley. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss First Financial Bancorp's third quarter and year-to-date 2019 financial results. Participating on today's call will be Claude Davis, Executive Chairman; Archie Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer and Bill Harrod, Chief Credit Officer. Both, the press release we issued yesterday and the accompanying slide presentation are available on our website at www.bankatfirst.com under the Investor Relations section. We will make references to the slides contained in the accompanying presentation during today's call. Additionally, please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure contained in the third quarter of 2019 earnings release, as well as our SEC filings for a full discussion of the company's risk factors. The information we will provide today is accurate as of September 30, 2019, and we will not be updating any forward-looking statements to reflect facts or circumstances after this call. I'll now turn the call over to Archie Brown. Thank you, Scott. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our financial results for the third quarter. Before I turn the call over to Jamie to discuss those results in greater detail, I would like to make a few comments regarding our quarterly performance, successful integration of Bannockburn Global Forex, and other capital deployment activities. Our third quarter results were strong, reflecting continued top quartile performance and marking our 116th quarter of profitability – consecutive quarter profitability. Our performance demonstrates strength in our businesses despite a more challenging interest rate backdrop and was highlighted by consistent earnings, solid loan growth and strong fee income. For the quarter, our adjusted performance metrics included earnings per share of $0.56, a 1.54% return on average assets, a 17.6% return on average tangible common equity, and a 52% efficiency ratio. Core banking trends continue to be positive with loan demand remaining strong across many of our units resulting in record originations, enabling us to grow loan balances by approximately 4% on an annualized basis. Deposits were mixed with growth in our noninterest-bearing balances tempered by lower money market balances and seasonal declines in public fund balances. Our core net interest margin remained strong and on the high end of the range previously provided, supported by disciplined deposit cost management, enabling us to mitigate some of the impact from declining rates. Overall, credit trends are very good and improved during the quarter as both, nonperforming and classified asset balances declined during the period. However, we were disappointed in elevated net charge-offs, which were driven by three franchise relationships discussed in prior periods. I'll provide more comments regarding the franchise portfolio a little later in our discussion. Our fee income performance was a highlight this quarter with growth of over 15% year-over-year, driven by continued record client derivative fees and mortgage income and the addition of foreign exchange income from our newly acquired Bannockburn unit. As anticipated, the third quarter saw a 49% decline in bankcard income from the linked quarter due to the impact of Durbin. Our 52% efficiency ratio continues to be a bright spot although we saw elevated expenses during the quarter even after adjusting for severance and merger related items, largely driven by performance based incentives, continued strategic investments and some transitory expenses. We were also pleased to complete the integration of Bannockburn during the quarter, which will allow us to broaden the product offering to our middle market clients, while also enabling us to provide banking services to their extensive customer base. The addition of this experienced team and its capital market offerings creates tremendous opportunities for our banks, clients and shareholders. During the quarter, we made progress in our share repurchase program by buying 1.1 million shares. We were able to enhance shareholder value while sustaining financial strength and capital flexibility. While the acquisition of Bannockburn and the share repurchases modestly impacted our capital ratios, our continued strong capital levels provide opportunities for additional capital deployment opportunities in the future. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jamie to discuss further details of our third quarter results. After Jamie's discussion, I'll wrap up with some comments on our franchise portfolio, forward-looking commentary and closing remarks, Jamie? Thank you, Archie, and good morning everyone. Slides 3 and 4 provide a summary of our third quarter 2019 performance. As Archie mentioned, third quarter performance was solid as loan growth, net interest margin, fee income and efficiency, all met or surpassed our expectations. Capital ratios remain healthy despite declining slightly as a result of closing the Bannockburn acquisition and share repurchase activity during the quarter. Although the interest rate environment continues to be challenging, our overall profitability remained strong in relation to our peer group. Slide 5, reconciles our GAAP earnings to adjusted earnings, highlighting items that we believe are important to understanding our quarterly performance. Adjusted net income was $55.5 million or $0.56 per share for the quarter, which excludes $5.2 million of severance and merger-related cost and $711,000 of cost related to branch consolidations. As shown on slide 6, these adjusted earnings equate to a return on average assets of 1.54% and a return on average tangible common equity of 17.6%. Further, our 52% adjusted efficiency ratio reflects our continued ability to appropriately manage expenses, while making targeted investments and growing the business. Turning to slide 7 net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis declined 8 basis points in the third quarter to 3.96%. The margin was negatively impacted by lower interest rates resulting in lower asset yields. Basic net interest margin declined 9 basis points compared to the linked quarter as lower asset yields combined with additional days in the quarter more than offset a favorable shift in funding cost and mix. As we've mentioned in previous quarters, we anticipate further margin pressure given the potential for additional Fed rate cuts, which will negatively impact asset yields as our loan portfolio is 59% variable rate. As shown on slide 8, the yield on loans declined 15 basis points and the investment yield dropped 8 basis points. We partially offset these declines by proactively managing our deposit pricing, which helped lower our cost of deposits by 2 basis points. Slide 9 depicts our current loan mix and balance shifts compared to the linked quarter. End of period loan balances increased $83 million as ICRE and mortgage loan growth outpaced a slight decline in C&I and an intentional reduction in franchise balances. We remain optimistic regarding future loan growth potential and expect the fourth quarter to approximate the third quarter results. Slide 10 shows the mix of our deposit base as well as a progression of average deposits from the linked quarter. Average deposit balances declined $78 million as public fund and money market declines outpaced increases in noninterest-bearing accounts and brokered CDs. Overall, deposit costs stabilized and began to slightly decline in the back half of the quarter with a reduction in interest rates. We intend to actively manage these costs in future periods to help alleviate pressure on the net interest margin. Slide 11 highlights our noninterest income and expense for the quarter. Fee income was bolstered by the Bannockburn acquisition as well as continued momentum in client derivatives, deposit service charges and Mortgage Banking. These fees helped offset the impact from Durbin, which drove a $3.2 million or 49% decline in bankcard income during the period. Noninterest expense for the quarter is depicted on slide12. Higher salaries and benefits were driven by incentives tied to the overall company performance outpacing our peer group as well as the strong client derivative and Mortgage Banking income. The quarter included $1.4 million of Bannockburn operating costs. In addition, we had approximately $1 million of transitory costs such as recruiting fees, fraud and OREO losses that we don't expect to occur in future periods. We also recognized in FDIC assessment credit during the quarter, which helped offset the increases previously mentioned. Slide 13 depicts our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. Provision expense declined during the period, although it was slightly higher than expected. Third quarter net charge-offs were $10.2 million or 45 basis points of total loans, which included $6.3 million related to three franchise relationships discussed in previous quarters. Classified assets, which we believe to be the leading indicator of credit losses declined as a percentage of total assets from 1.02% to 0.92%, which is the lowest level in over a year. This Classified asset level combined with the resolution of problem credit drove the decline in the loan loss reserve balance. Finally, as shown on slides 14 and 15, capital ratios remained strong and are in excess of our stated targets. As Archie mentioned, we were active in repurchasing 1.1 million shares during the quarter, which reflects our intention to maximize shareholder value while sustaining financial strength and capital flexibility. Our tangible book value and capital ratios were modestly impacted by the acquisition of Bannockburn and the share repurchase activity. Tangible book value per share declined 3.6% during the third quarter to $12.33 and our tangible common equity ratio declined 17 basis points or 1.8% to 9.17%. I'll now turn it back over to Archie for an update on the franchise portfolio, thoughts on our fourth quarter outlook and closing comments. Thank you Jamie. On slide 16, we provide additional information regarding our franchise portfolio. As stated earlier, we incurred additional losses in this portfolio during the quarter related to three relationships. Of the $6.3 million in charge-offs, $3.2 million is related to the resolution of the large relationship we disclosed in the first quarter. Remaining $3.1 million relates to the continued workout of two relationships discussed in prior periods. Slide 16 reflects that of the current $474 million portfolio, $29.5 million is rated special mention or substandard/nonaccrual. The three relationships mentioned above represent all of the substandard nonaccrual balances. A few other points to make about the status of the current portfolio, the overall portfolio is performing well, 94% is rated pass. We monitor the portfolio on an ongoing basis and proactively manage relationships. Portfolio is granular, the top-10 relationships comprise 29% of the portfolio, make up all of the relationships over $10 million, seven of which have real estate as additional collateral in addition to all business assets and the personal guarantee of the owners. As I mentioned in the first quarter, we've been proactively managing this portfolio to improve its overall risk profile since late 2016. Since year-end 2018, the portfolio has declined by 15% as we've exited relationships that we determined did not fit our risk profile or that have had material deterioration in performance. We estimate the portfolio will decline another 10% to 15% due to the intentional slowing of origination activity and the work out of special mention and substandard loans. Before we end our prepared remarks, I want to comment on our forward outlook as shown on slide 17. We remain optimistic in our ability to maintain loan growth given the continued strength in our loan pipelines. We expect loan balances to increase in the low-single digits on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter. Long-term, we continue to target mid- to high-single-digit growth given the investments we've made in talent, our core operating markets and our comprehensive product offerings. Regarding the net interest margin projections will be largely dependent on the path that the Fed takes moving forward. Assuming no further cuts, our outlook is at 3.65% to 3.70% margin excluding purchase accounting. As always, the net interest margin can fluctuate depending on a variety of factors and we actively work to mitigate downward rate pressures on the asset side through disciplined deposit pricing management. As stated earlier, credit quality is stable with a normalized provision covering charge-offs and accounting for loan growth. However, individual loans can have a transitory impact from time-to-time. We expect fee income to increase to the range of $34 million to $36 million over the next quarter, including the full quarter impact of Bannockburn, which represents approximately $6 million of income. With respect to expenses, we continuously focus on efficiency even while making strategic investments to support the long-term success of our business. We expect expenses in the range of $84 million to $86 million, including the $5 million full quarter impact of Bannockburn. With regard to taxes our outlook for the fourth quarter is 17.5%, and includes a 2% reduction for the expected recognition of tax credits. With Bannockburn closed and integrated, our strong capital levels, earnings power and consistency provide flexibility for continued capital deployment strategies. We're pleased with the strength and performance of our company. We believe this strength positions us well for managing in the current environment and pursuing growth opportunities that meet our objectives. At this point, this concludes the prepared remarks. I will now open up the call for questions. Keith? Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And this morning's first question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Morning, guys. Thank you. Hey, Scott. Hey Scott. Hey, just a first question on the franchise finance, the finance portfolio. Archie, just curious about your thoughts on any additional lost content within the portfolio and why we didn't see a need to reserve for any of those? And I guess, first the question is, back in the second quarter I think we had discussed a couple of the credits, but it didn't look like there was going to be any charge-offs related to them at that time if I recall correctly. So just curious how sort of the thinking trajected between then and now? Yeah. Scott, on the on the first part of the question, we did in the prior quarter have a higher, increased reserve related to the one that was resolved this quarter. (00:16:42) And then there was a charge against that – not a full charge, but a charge against that reserve this quarter. So, that's the $3.2 million piece, I believe. With respect to the other two, there's been some further deterioration in the credits. I think the one came up last quarter in a question, because I believe it was – had moved to an accruing TDR status. And, at the time when we looked at the overall value, enterprise value of the stores involved, we believed we had it adequately valued. What's been  (00:17:22) since, with respect to that one is that that franchisee had two store concepts. And, in fact what's occurred is, one of those concept has now been sold. And as part of that sale there was some loss that we recorded. So, that's that one. With respect to the third one, it's been a longer term problem probably for two-and-a-half years or more, and we had a – we thought we had a sale worked out with that credit. And for multiple quarters, there have been an ongoing due diligence and that sale fell apart. And as we started to evaluate the current performance of the stores, we believed it wasn't appropriate to take a partial charge down. That one now is again in negotiation with another party for sale. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. But I guess ultimately it seems safe to – while maybe these handful of credits has maybe taken longer and cost a bit more than we thought, it seems like it is indeed isolated to these couple if not the broader franchise portfolio. Fair enough assessment? Yeah. I think if you look at the industry, there are some challenges, labor costs and some other things overall. But when we look at our operators, especially with some of the winnowing we've done in the portfolio over the last year plus, Scott, we feel like the operators we have are high quality operators and performing – if you look at the overall portfolio, performing well. Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then, separately, Jamie question on the margin just so understand it perfectly. We're looking for basic margin of 3.65% to 3.70% or at least... Yeah. ...margin before purchase accounting adjustments 3.65% to 3.70%... Right. But if we do get another rate cut by the Fed here at some point in the very near future, that would imply most of the quarter's worth of impact for an additional 6 to 8 basis points of reduction. So if we do get a cut presumably... Right. ...it would come in to low this 3.65% to 3.70% right? That's correct. Yeah. So the 3.65% to 3.70% assumes no further rate cuts. And then, so, we're kind of trying to set it up for you and your colleagues to be able to then assume, because we know you guys assume when – cuts at different time. So, basically 3.65% to 3.70% with no further cuts. And then a 6 to 8-point drop with each 25-basis point cut. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. And you can build the timing of that however you see fit. Perfect. All right. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Yes. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Hey. Good morning. Hi, Chris. Hey, Chris. Jamie, maybe another margin question for you. You shrunk the Investment portfolio by about $300 million on a period basis. Right. I'm interested in kind of thoughts on the balances of that portfolio going forward? Yeah. And also as you kind of take a step back, if the margin is going to be under pressure like most banks, our earning assets – how do we feel about fourth quarter earning assets and net interest income? I think that's what people are really focusing on is the revenue, but... Yeah. ...can you just maybe add some color there? Thanks. Yeah. So just with the shape of the yield curve we did, throughout the third quarter reduced the Investment portfolio by $300 million. I think on average it was down about $120 million for the third quarter, but we'll get the full effect of that in the fourth quarter. So what we did, we sold – essentially sold securities that had an average yield of about call it around $250 million and then reduced short-term borrowings. So, the spread on that was relatively low. It was very low. And so, we just essentially de-levered a little bit and reduced the portfolio. So, our intent for the short-term is that we will keep the portfolio basically right at that $3 billion, so at the level that we ended the third quarter, we'll keep the portfolio at that level and then the earning asset growth would be the growth that we see in the loan portfolio. Okay. Great. And kind of thinking out, if we stay in this environment, you do have some borrowings on the balance sheet. I mean, is this kind of a strategy that might be considered more into 2020. Just kind of shrinking, building a little bit capital, recycling it through buyback. Is that kind of what you're thinking? Yes. That is exactly what we were thinking there. Based on where our stock price is, we would be in the market buying shares like we did in the third quarter and reducing the balance sheet and increasing the capital ratios in order to essentially subsidize the share repurchase program. We would continue that given the yield curve staying the same. Understood. Okay. Great. Yes. And then maybe if I could stick with it on the deal. I think when you announced it, you said it was going to be around $30 million annual revenue, plus about 15% annual growth. I think the guide says $6 million for the quarter, for Q4. Is there seasonality in the business or revenues are little bit less than what you might have thought initially? Yeah, Chris. This is Archie. There is some seasonality. You know, we think during an integration, there's just a little bit of noise and the tension on working through the deal. But as we look at Q4, I think we're seeing approximately $6 million. And if you look at next year, we would still think that we're going to see probably more like an $8 million a quarter and it won't be linear, but it will be kind of an average of that throughout the year, so you're talking in the low 30s in terms of revenue next year. Okay. Great. And just the final one if I could. The tax rate that you've pointed out, Jamie, in the fourth quarter, that's just a one quarter event, right? It goes back to, what,19.5% next year? That's correct. Yeah. We are looking at getting some tax credits in the fourth quarter assuming a new market tax credit project goes into effect. Okay. And same with the FDIC assessment, right, that will go back assuming you don't get another refund? That will bounce back. Now the fourth quarter will still be a little bit lower, because we have some credit still to eat up, but it will go back to kind of normal levels. It'll go back I would say to about half normal levels in the fourth quarter. And then, first quarter, back to 100%. Great. Thanks. Yes. Thank you. And the next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Good morning, guys. Morning, Terry. Thanks for the details on page 16. I guess the annual review that you do on the portfolio, when is the last time you've kind of reviewed the portfolio specifically those top-10 relationships as well as that largest relationship? Was that done in the quarter, earlier in the year or last year? Hey, Terry. Yeah. Terry. This is – I'm going to have Bill Harrod, our Chief Credit Officer jump in here and talk about the process we use for ongoing reviews and annual reviews. Thank you. Absolutely. We do a quarterly review of all the franchise transactions, including covenant reviews, et cetera. Then we do a full past review on everything above $5 million, the next one for that review is going to be in November. We do touch anything above – really above the $5 million level on a covenant test on a quarterly basis. So, we do a full deep dive twice a year and we do a little bit lighter of a touch every quarter. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I guess any – CECL less than three months away, any thoughts on CECL as we think about 2020? And then, did you guys disclose that the loan mark that will flow into the reserve on January 1 in connection to CECL, just so we're modeling out the reserve as accurate as we can today? Right. So the second part of that question the amount of the mark that will flow into the reserve is very low just given the fact that we didn't have to buy any purchase impaired loans. It was very low compared to the – for the acquisitions. So on the CECL side, at this point we are not disclosing the range at this point. I'd say at this point, we are in the – where we are kind of tweaking kind of the models that we have. We've had a couple of dry runs, and then a parallel run that would – based on our data. And really we're just working through final assumptions in our internal controls. So, we're in good shape to be ready to go January 1. We've got our model validated, but we are not at this point prepared to disclose what that range is. Now, keep in mind with our CECL reserve, our reserve is going to go up I would say at a higher percentage than most of our peers just given the fact that we have a fairly large percentage of acquired loans that are sitting in our loan portfolio that currently have no reserve. So, it's going to go up by a bigger percentage, but we're not at this point prepared to disclose that. And will that be something in your 10-Q, something you'll talk about in January when do you expect to have some final numbers around CECL? Yeah. We're still evaluating that whether we're going to put that in our Q or whether we would follow up with that later. Sure. Okay. Thank you, guys. Yes, sure. Thank you. And the next question comes from Nathan Race with Piper Jaffray. Hi, guys. Good morning. Good morning, Nathan. Going back to the last question on the deal. I think when you announced the transaction, you guys were targeting a pre-tax margin around 40%. And the guidance you guys provide for fees and expenses tied to Bannockburn implies a little lower margin for the fourth quarter. And, Archie, I appreciate your comments that the fees should ramp as we move into next year. But just any color in terms of if you guys still think that 40% pre-tax margin is doable or if maybe there is some upside just given the cost side of the equation? No. We think the margin that we disclosed before is really kind of an EBITDA margin, they were tracking to, we still think that that type of a contribution is similar to what we had shared with you before. Okay. Got it. And then, if I could just ask one kind of housekeeping question on the purchase accounting accretion. I think in the past, Jamie, you've suggested that... Yeah. ...it should decline by 1-basis-point or so in each subsequent quarter. Is that still a right way to think about that decline? Yes. Yeah. So, based on our prepayment assumptions, the fourth quarter is between 19 and 20 basis points of purchase accounting accretion. And then, again, that goes down – you got it right, it goes down, call it, 1.5-basis point each quarter. Okay. Perfect. I appreciate you guys taking the questions. Yes. Thanks, Nathan. Thank you.  And the next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Hey. Good morning, guys. Hi, Jon. Hi. Just a one follow-up. And then, I just want to talk about loan growth as well. But, Archie, you've talked about the franchise finance longer term plan to bring balances down a bit more 10% to 15%. What kind of time period are you thinking about on that? Yeah. I think if we look at – Jon, we've been kind of looking ahead and that's probably a four to five-quarter period as we're looking out. That's probably what you'll see it'll just trim down from this point probably through the end of 2020. Okay. Okay. Good. That helps me. And then on slide 9, you show a bit of a decline in Commercial. And I think that's separate from franchise finance, because you have that down below. So, maybe talk a little bit about that, what's happening there? Yeah. Some of this was – we made did make some other progress in some loans that we were, I'd say we'd wanted to move out, we made some progress during the quarter in our Commercial group in particular. I mean, I think that's a piece of it. On the Commercial side, we had a bit of a lower origination quarter than we've seen in the prior quarters. We've got some decent pipelines, but for the quarter, the originations were lower than what we've seen in, let's say, Q1 or Q2. So, I think it's a combination of those two things. Okay. Got it. And then, one question on deposit cost. Jamie, I think you mentioned later in the quarter, second half of the quarter you guys were able to bring down some deposit costs. Just curious maybe the magnitude of it, what you did and any surprising reactions at all or did customers generally expect it? Jon, it's Archie. I'll start... Okay. ...maybe Jamie can clean up. Yes. Okay. Even in the summer, we sat down with our consumer team in particular and talked about where could we make some real progress. And for us some of that comes more in the money market category in particular. So, we took some actions there in particular. Of course, there is CD balances, we started to adjust those as well. So those are probably the areas we focused on first. You think about it in a lot of the interest-bearing – other interest-bearing transaction accounts or savings accounts, there's not a lot of room. So it's money market for us, it's CDs, it's probably public funds a little bit. It's a little more elastic, but still we've  probably made (00:32:59) a little progress there as well. So, those are the key areas that I think we focused on and probably starting July-ish. Yeah. So, I mean, I would say at first, Jon, we thought that keeping our deposit cost just where we kind of were in the interest rate cycle, coming into the quarter we would potentially see deposit costs at best remaining flat, but I think we were able to get out in front of it a little bit. We got not overly aggressive, but moved some of our pricing down on the money market side, and we saw those costs kind of flatten out in the first part of the quarter. And then, we were seeing a couple of basis point drop in deposit costs in the last couple months of the quarter. So, I would say I was pleasantly surprised. I thought that they would be flat for the quarter. So, getting those couple of basis points out of the deposit cost side was nice on the and helped the margins. Yeah. Well, that's good to see. Okay. Thanks a lot guys appreciate it. Yes. Thank you, Jon. Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Chris McGratty with KBW. Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up. Jamie or Archie, you guys had a really good history of managing costs in – regardless the environment. How do we think and obviously Bannockberk (sic) [Bannockburn ] is going to put a little bit upward pressure on your efficiency ratio. How do we think about the bank in terms of operating efficiency heading into the next several quarters a couple of years if this environment persists? Yeah. Are there levers you can pull on the expenses? I mean, what's the kind of arrangement you guys are targeting? Yeah. So, you know if you look at our outlook slides, you take the middle of it, we're projecting call it $85 million in noninterest expense here going forward. I think, I mean, overall I would tell you we will see – I would call it normal kind of annualized percentage increases in that 2% to 4% range. But, I mean, we are taking a look at strategic investments on the technology side. But then on the on the flipside of that, we're looking at ways that we can offset that and cut costs elsewhere, so we can reallocate dollars within the organization and make those strategic investments, whether it is reducing the branch count or using technology to get more efficient. So, having said that with the decline in the margin and also with Bannockburn having a just a higher efficiency ratio, you will see our efficiency ratio tick up a little bit. We've been in that 50% to 52% range kind of over the last three or four quarters once we got through all of the, I would say all of the merger and getting the cost savings out of that, but you will see that tick up a little bit given the investments we're going to make and also with Bannockburn. So, you might see a tick up a couple of percentage points. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And at this time, I would like to return the floor to Archie Brown for any closing comments. Thank you, Keith. Thank you, everybody, for being on the call today and listening to our quarter. We, again, feel great about where we're heading as a company and look forward to you talking again next time. Have a great day. Thank you. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Glacier Bancorp Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Randy Chesler, President and CEO of Glacier Bancorp. Mr. Chesler, the floor is yours. All right. Thank you, Resty. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me here in Kalispell this morning is Ron Copher, our Chief Financial Officer; Don Chery, our Chief Administrative Officer; Angela Dose, our Chief Accounting Officer; Barry Johnston, our Chief Credit Officer; Tom Dolan, our Deputy Chief Credit Administrator; and Byron Pollan, our Treasurer. Let me first thank you all for joining us today and hope you're all enjoying the fall. Yesterday, we released our third quarter 2019 results. This is a very strong quarter for us with strong net interest margin, excellent deposit growth, steady and improving credit performance, and good quality loan growth. As we noted in the last quarter's call, we feel we are very well-positioned to navigate through the current interest rate environment. And despite the headwinds in the market for banks, challenging interest rate curve, later innings of a long-term recovery, the Glacier team is strong and we are continuing to build the balance sheet and the company for the long haul. Some highlights from the quarter. Earnings were $51.6 million, an increase of $2 million or 5% over the prior-year third quarter, including current period acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million and 5.4 million of stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of options from the Heritage Bancorp acquisition. Without the acquisition expenses, net income would have been $56.2 million, an increase from the prior-year third quarter of $6.9 million or 14%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year third quarter, but this included the acquisition-related expenses. Organic loan balances increased $84 million or 4% annualized. On a full-year basis, loan balances grew $393 million or 6%. We also had organic core deposit growth of $302 million or 12% annualized. And organic noninterest deposit growth was a very strong $211 million or 26% annualized. This quarter's deposit growth exceeded our expectations. Net interest margin for the quarter of 4.42% of earnings assets increased 9 basis points over the prior quarter, excluding the 2 basis points from discount accretion and 5 basis points from nonaccrual interest. The core net interest margin grew 8 basis points in the quarter to 4.35% from 4.27% in the prior quarter and up 17 basis points from 4.18% in the prior-year third quarter. We are very pleased to be one of the few banks in this earnings season to be able to talk about an expanding margin. Return on assets was 1.55% for the quarter, a 14 basis points decrease over the prior quarter as a result of the acquisition-related expenses that occurred during the quarter. Without those expenses, ROA would have been 1.69% for the quarter. Tangible book value per share at $15.53 at quarter end increased $0.50 a share from the prior quarter and increased $1.90 per share from a year ago. We also declared a regular dividend of $0.29 per share, our 138th consecutive quarterly dividend which was a 7% increase over the prior quarter. At the end of July, we successfully closed on the acquisition of Heritage Bancorp in Reno, Nevada. Heritage became our 16th division and our first entrant into Nevada, and we are very excited to welcome the Heritage Bank team to the Glacier team. And then in late September, we also announced the acquisition of State Bank Corp. in Lake Havasu, Arizona with total assets of $677 million. State Bank will be combined with our Foothills Bank division and continue its over 20 years' legacy of serving Arizona communities. The acquisition, of course, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary conditions of closing, and we're expecting to close at – late this year or early next year. Now, for a little more color on the quarterly results. Loan production for the first quarter was once again generally well-distributed among all divisions. Loan paydowns were slightly elevated compared with past third quarters. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $9.5 billion. As a result of the slower third quarter and typically slower fourth quarter, we're anticipating a 6% organic loan growth rate for the year. While we continue to feel very good about our Western markets, we've seen an increase in payoffs with customers taking advantage of the strong markets. Liquidity generated from these sales has not been immediately reinvested by sellers at the rate we've seen in the past due to those sellers being a bit more cautious about making new investments. In addition, we've seen a small increase in money center banks making larger loans to some of our customers at rates we don't think adequately pay for risk at this point in the cycle. So, we're happy with our rate of growth and we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to lending with our eye in the longer-term. Total investment securities of $2.6 billion decreased $28 million or 1% during the quarter and are flat compared to the prior-year third quarter. Investment securities represented 20% of total assets at the end of the quarter, compared to 23% at the end of the third quarter a year ago. Once again, our key credit quality ratios improved in almost all categories across the board, reflecting the strength of our loan portfolio. Early-stage delinquencies as a percentage of loans at the end of the third quarter were 31 basis points, a decrease of 12 basis points from the prior quarter and flat to the prior third quarter a year ago. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $3.5 million compared to $2.2 million in the third quarter a year ago. This increase in net charge-offs was primarily centered in one loan with a $1.9 million loss resulting from a negotiated short sale. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets at the end of the quarter were 40 basis points, which is 1 basis point lower than the prior quarter and 21 basis points lower than the prior-year third quarter. At the end of the quarter, the dollar amount of NPAs were $55.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 6% from the prior quarter. But the increase was primarily driven by a $2.7 million loan that we expect to resolve early next year. A number of our divisions and division chief credit officers continue to do an excellent job working through these credits. We think now is the time to be more proactive with the weaker credits and we will continue to do so. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding at the end of this quarter was 1.32%, which is down 14 basis points from the prior quarter and down 31 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. Provision for loan losses were zero in the current and prior quarters. This reflects our continued very positive outlook on our portfolio and our markets. We don't see these one-off loan issues as a trend. Core deposits ended the quarter at $10.7 billion. Total core deposits were organically up 12% annualized or $302 million and increased $287 million or 3% from the quarter a year ago. Noninterest-bearing deposits were organically up $211 million or 26% annualized and increased $280 million or 9% over the prior year's third quarter. We've been focused on growing our share of noninterest deposits for some time now and are really pleased to see the growth trend. Noninterest deposits are now 35% of deposits, up from 32% a year ago. The cost of our core deposits was up slightly from 19 basis points to 21 basis points in the current quarter and up 5 basis points from the prior year's third quarter. We ended the quarter with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 88.71%, down from 90.27% at the end of the prior quarter, resulting from the acquisition and really strong deposit growth. The total cost of funding for the current quarter was 39 basis points. This was down from 45 basis points at the end of the prior quarter and 36 basis points at the end of the prior-year third quarter. The decrease was driven by an increase in low-cost deposits that was utilized to pay down high cost borrowings. Net income for the quarter was $131 million, which was up $11.1 million or 9% from the prior quarter and increased $17.7 million or 16% over the prior-year third quarter. Interest income on commercial loans increased $9.2 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and increased $16.6 million or 21% from the prior-year third quarter. As I noted last quarter, there had been a lot of talk about margin, and now fast forward to this earnings season and the conversation about margin is still continuing. Going forward in 2019, we continue to believe we'll see a generally stable core margin operating in a tight band around the current levels. Now, the impact on the margin in 2020 will depend on the steepness of the interest rate curve at that time. But overall, we feel very well-positioned to navigate through this environment. In early September, the company implemented a balance sheet strategy to increase its net interest income and net interest margin. The strategy included early termination of the company's $260 million notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps and corresponding debt at 3.73%, along with the sale of $308 million of available-for-sale debt securities. Sale of the investment securities during the quarter resulted in a gain of $13.8 million. Offsetting the gain was a $10 million loss recognized on the early termination of the swaps and a $3.5 million write-down of deferred penalty payments on federal home loan bank borrowings. So, the net here is, we believe the strategy will mitigate the 5 to 7 basis points of margin headwinds that we talked about for the rest of 2019 on our last quarter's call and continue to provide a bit of support under our margin going forward. Noninterest income for the quarter totaled $43 million. That was up 40% or $12 million from the prior quarter and increased $10.6 million or 33% over the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily attributable to the sale of securities related to the balance sheet strategy. Service charges and other fees of $15.1 million decreased $4.9 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and this was due to the decrease in interchange fees as a result of the Durbin Amendment. Notably, gain on sale of loans of $10.4 million increased $2.6 million or 34% over the prior quarter and $3.1 million or 43% over the prior-year third quarter. This was due to increased purchase and refinance activity at very, very strong levels. The company sold $308 million of securities and recognized a $13.8 million – a gain of $13.8 million, an increase of $13.7 million from the prior quarter. Other income was down $2.3 million from the prior year's third quarter. And this was a result of a gain of $2.3 million on the sale of a former branch building in the prior-year third quarter. Noninterest expense for the quarter was $111 million and this increased $24.5 million or 28% from the prior quarter and $27.8 million or 34% over the prior-year third quarter. Compensation and employee benefits increased $10.5 million or 20%, and this was primarily due to the $5.4 million stock comp expense related to the acquisition and organic and acquisition growth which required more employees. Regulatory assessment and insurance decreased $1.3 million or 68% from the prior quarter as a result of the $1.3 million of Small Bank Assessment credits applied by the FDIC during the quarter. Other expenses of $29.1 million increased $13.8 million or 91% from the prior quarter. This was driven by the $3.5 million loss on the paydown of Federal Home Loan Bank debt and a $10 million loss on the termination of the cash flow hedges. Acquisition-related expenses were $2.1 million during the quarter compared to $1.8 million in the prior quarter and $1.3 million a year ago. Tax expense was $12.2 million, a decrease of $356,000 or 3% compared to an increase of $1.4 million or 13% from the prior-year third quarter. Effective tax rate is 19% compared to 18% in the prior-year third quarter. Efficiency ratio impacted by the current quarter, unusual events that we talked about, primarily related to the balance sheet strategy and the acquisition. Excluding those things, the efficiency ratio would have been closer to 54.4%, which keeps us in the range of the 54%, 55% that we've been talking about. So a lot going on, but we think this third quarter really represents an excellent performance by the company. In addition to delivering strong operating performance for the quarter, the company completed the acquisition of Heritage Bank and announced the acquisition of State Bank of Arizona. So, our 16 division presidents and their teams across our eight states now with Nevada, as well as our senior staff, continue to produce market-leading results and I would like to thank them all for their commitment and their drive to be the best. So, Resty, that concludes my formal remarks, and I'd now like to turn the call back over to you to open the line for any questions that our analysts may have. Sure, sir.  We have our first question on the line, Jeff Rulis from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Jeff. Randy, your comments on, I guess, elevated paydowns and perhaps more aggressive competition kind of moderating that growth outlook a little bit. We've got your kind of guide for 2020 – or excuse me, for the – through the end of the year, but how does that bleed into 2020, and do you see the paydowns as somewhat temporary? And I guess the balance of 2020, how would you look at growth? At this point, it looks like a pretty kind of equal segue into 2020 at these growth rates. We don't see – we don't expect a huge change in kind of those factors, but 5% to 6% kind of feels like what 2020 is going to look like at this point. Do you get the sense of just when you're talking to business customers, any softening or any behavioral changes given macro events that they're sort of pulling in the horns at all? Anything on that front? No. We talk to our customers a lot across our Western states. I think a lot of them remain very confident. I did make a note in my comments just as we see some of our longtime customers experienced in a lot of our markets sell properties, I think they're a little more cautious on making reinvestments, and that's part of what's taken our growth rate moderating in slightly. I don't think they have any concerns other than they just want to continue to make good investments as they're a little harder to find as the economy has continued to do well over a long period of time. Got it. Okay. And I don't know if Barry is on or just someone else can tackle it, just – do you guys have a CECL update to provide and just thoughts on that and provisioning levels potentially going forward? You want Barry? You got him. Okay. All right. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning. We have been running parallel runs since March. We went through about six different runs that we've compared the numbers with where we're at now, where we're going. Based on what we're seeing, given the fact that there's – it's still a moving target, the model isn't totally structured yet the way we want it. Also, we have an acquisition coming up with State Bank of Arizona that will impact the numbers. And of course, there's always the accounting adjustments that impact the numbers. But overall, we feel that with CECL implementation, there will be an increase in the reserve from where we project our reserve to be at year-end. How big that is, is still a soft number, so we're just kind of keeping that in our hip pocket until we get closer to year-end when we run the last incurred loss model. I see. Okay. Thanks. And maybe the one last one, just the mortgage banking kind of gain on sale, pretty robust. Obviously, we'll expect some seasonality, but any thoughts on how that's going quarter-to-date and maybe your thoughts on the out-year as well? Yeah. No, we're very happy. Pretty – very, very strong record quarter for us in terms of the volume, continues to look strong coming into the fourth quarter. So probably not quite as strong as our third quarter, but pretty good strength across the board. So, we see – we should see some good strength to continue there. Okay. Thank you. All right. You bet. Yes, sir. We have our next question on the line from Matthew Clark from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Good morning, Matthew. Good morning. Maybe first one just on the securities that were sold this quarter, can you give us a sense for the kind of the weighted average yield on that portion that was sold? Just trying to get a sense for what rolled off relative to what's still on the books? Yes. Matt, it's Ron. So, the weighted average yield was basically 2.94%. We sold just some of the longer-dated munis, but it's very few. The predominant portion of what we sold was the lower yielding agency securities including some of the agencies that we had from the Heritage acquisition. So, in terms of reinvesting that, we're just about halfway done with that. And overall, the metrics of the portfolio really haven't changed much. The yield came down maybe 3 basis points when you look at it Q3 over Q2. But in terms of duration, weighted average life, it's pretty consistent with what we had at the end of the second quarter. I would also take note that we built our cash position, so we still got that to hopefully reinvest or even pay down some higher cost deposits we have. Okay. And then just on deposit costs, have you stabilized pricing at this point or do you feel like there's still some upward pressure in terms of exception pricing in deposit rates? Yeah. I would probably say we feel pretty stabilized. We've seen a lot less request for interest rate exception. So, I think the market has settled down quite a bit. There's still always the one-off kind of circumstance but generally, Matt, it's stabilized quite a bit. Okay. And then just on charge-offs and credit in general, the $1.9 million loss on the short sale, is there more cleanup work to be done here where we might see some lumpy charge-offs or is that process largely complete at this point? Yeah. We don't see – we don't have a pipeline of credits to work. This one had been in the portfolio for quite a while, had been troubled in the past. And we just – the point I was – I made in my comments were, we just feel now is the time to get a little more proactive with some of these weaker credits and deal with them. We could have continued to kind of work that through over a number of years. We just felt it was a good time to exit. And I think on a one-off basis, we may see more of those pop up, but we don't – right now, we don't see a lot of that. But again, our bias now with a still relatively strong economy is to be proactive with weaker credits. We don't see trends in the portfolio weakness, but weaker operators are probably the biggest issue right now across the board. So, if we see folks that we think can't carry us in the distance, we'll be a little bit more proactive. Okay. And then just last one, the operating and efficiency ratio of 54.4%, as you kind of work through the budgeting process for next year, are you looking to manage within that range still the 54% to 55%... Yes. ...on an operating basis? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Resty? Yes, sir. We have our next question from Gordon McGuire from Stephens. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. So, I just wanted to follow up the efficiency question with just how to think about the next quarter expense levels. If I back out what I would have assumed for the acquisitions on the compensation line, it looks like the core compensation was up about $3 million which I know you attributed to some new hires, but it just seems a little bit elevated. I'm wondering whether there were some more unusual items or whether this is a decent run rate to look at before cost saves come in. Yeah. No, there were no other unusual items in there, and I think you're seeing just the acquisition increases that we brought on with Layton and then with Heritage Bank pretty close together. So, should be a good – what you have seen now should be a pretty good run rate then to – for the future. Okay. Thanks. And just to clarify, the FDIC Small Bank Assessment credits, those are more onetime, so I guess the regulatory expense should move back closer to $2 million a quarter once the remaining credits are applied? Yeah. We don't know when they're going to give us the credits. It's probably going be over the next couple of quarters, but really it's up to the FDIC and their fund levels. But once that's depleted, then that's the end of it. Got it. Then last one for me on the loan yields, on a core basis they've been up 4 basis points from the first quarter, but it's just hard for me to see what the underlying impact from the rate environment are, just given the acquisitions which I think came over at higher yields. Yes. Is there any way you can piece that out and help us think about repricing trends over the next few quarters on a kind of a legacy basis? Let's see. So, if you're looking at the loan yields, they have done pretty well. And we did – we are getting some left out of the acquisitions that we brought on, both with a little bit higher loan yields. So, that's a positive. On the repricing, I don't know, Ron, do you want to comment on that, I think the question about the impact of the repricing? Yeah. So, the – we have quite a lot of floor protection. We look at this in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. So, we've got that holding up, lot of what could have repriced. So – but the new production yields are definitely coming in lower. We're not going to define gravity. But just keep in mind, when you look at the margin, you can see that the overall loans went up to 5.23% from 5.20%. So in there, you'll see the discount accretion plus the 5 basis points on the nonaccrual interest recoveries. So, yeah, I think on the floors, the – just keep in mind, three quarters of the book has a floor. It's either fixed or has floor protection. And when we look at the fourth quarter, about 90% of the portfolio is protected in some – one way or the other. Got it. All right. Thank you. That's all I had. You bet. Resty, do we have any other questions? Yes, sir. We have our next question from Michael Young from SunTrust. Your line is open. Hey, everyone. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up first on the loan yield question that was just asked. Just on new production, where are the new production yields coming on relative to the back book, just given the 150-basis-point drop in five-year rates since last year? Yeah. So, where the – we've said in the prior-quarter call that the – we thought the loan production yields would come in just north of 5.15%. Actually did pretty well. They came in at just, say, between 5.05%, 5.10%, right in that range. So that held up as well. Again, we think that's attributed to our floors, and we'll still see some of that downward pressure. So, in terms of the back book, there's very little lift in the vintages going back two or three years ago, just given where the five-year Federal Home Loan Bank rates are, which we tend to price off the majority of our portfolio. Okay. So, essentially, you're just getting wider spreads on new production? Yeah. Where we can, yeah. Okay. And then also wanted to just follow up on the comments of kind of the slower loan growth with higher payoffs, but it still seems like deposit growth remains very strong. So how are you kind of thinking about that strategically from a mix perspective on the balance sheet? Is that incremental deposit funding going to go into the securities book, or how should we think about that? Yeah. No, I think we'd like to see incoming deposits fund loan growth, and I think we're seeing that now. So, we're happy to have a pretty good balance. But to the extent now that we have most of the high-cost debt terminated and off the balance sheet, yeah, any kind of excess will go towards reinvestment in the portfolio. Okay. So, we could see some margin compression a little bit from mix shift, but it would still be NII dollars positive because the balance sheet may grow a little faster than loan growth potentially? Exactly. Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just the last one kind of cleanup question on – or an update on the State Bank acquisition, just any updates on timing around closing or system conversion? Closing, we have to go through regulatory approval, and that's underway. And I think late this year, or kind of early next year is probably the right timing. If that timing works out, we would, look, we have a conversion spot open kind of towards the later end of the first quarter. And we generally like to do those acquisitions where we have two banks in the same market sooner rather than later, because as – when we announced them, we have a lot of customers from both banks going to the new bank and trying to do transaction. So, the sooner – we generally like to do those sooner rather than later. Okay. And one last cleanup question for Ron, just on the tax rate, with the securities restructuring, I don't think it'd be a meaningful adjustment, but any change to the tax rate that we should expect? I think we're going to hold at 19%. I've been saying that it would be 20%. It started to move up, but 19% is better. Part of that is, we've been able to do some more tax credits, and that's had a pretty good benefit. Okay. Thanks. We have our next question on the line from Andrew Liesch from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. You've answered... Good morning. ...nearly all my questions. Just one quick follow-up though. Just curious if you have the dollar amounts of the loan production and the dollar amounts of the paydowns? We can give you kind of a high-level number here. So, production was somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion; payoffs, kind of between – right around $900 million, kind of in that ballpark. Got you. Thank you. Yeah. Like I said, you've covered everything else. Thanks so much. You bet. Our next question comes from the line of Jacque Bohlen from KBW. Your line is open. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jacque. Hi. I was just wondering if you could provide us with an update, given some of the fluctuations in the securities portfolio as to where you're thinking about a target range of securities to assets. Ron, I know you mentioned you're going to be purchasing some and maybe deploying some cash, but just wanted to know where you're thinking about that ratio going forward. Don't want to go below the 20%. I could see it going up 21%, no more. Just – so I think that's the absolute best number I can give you right now, Jacque. I'm truly hoping that excess cash goes into loans, but you've heard the comments. Okay. So, pretty steady from here? Yes. And then I just want to make sure that I understand all the NIM commentary and how those different actions play in with each other. So, essentially, the actions that you took in September will have a positive flow-through next quarter, because you'll get the full quarter's effect, and those will, in essence, offset some of the other pressures from the adverse rate environment to keep the margin fairly flattish. Is that the message? Exactly right. Okay. Thank you. You bet. And then just one broader one, probably for you, Randy. So, you've had an excellent year with M&A just in terms of announcing and closing deals in fairly rapid succession. If you get this  (39:20) one closed, you'll have one closing in 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q. How are you feeling about future acquisitions? Is everything – do you anticipate it if that conversion takes place in 1Q to be fully integrated and ready to jump into the next one? Just your updated thoughts on everything. Yeah. No, with this – so this was a record year in terms of announced transactions for us with the three transactions: First National Bank of Layton, Heritage, and now State Bank, close to $2 billion in assets. And the team, I think, has done an incredible job of working on those and closing them and then doing the integration. I think we continue to have – the door is open. We continue to talk to folks. We feel if there's the right opportunity, that's something we could act on next year. But we're going to continue our disciplined approach to the market, and just look for the best of really good banks, good markets, good people. So, we – that may mean another one is on the table. It may mean that we just not are seeing what we'd like to see. It's just difficult to tell at this point in terms of the quality of the deal flow. But we're – the team is – muscle memory on acquisitions is sharp, and so I think we'll get through the ones we have. And if something very compelling appears, we're going to take a hard look at it. Okay. And does the implementation of CECL have any effect on how you think about deal announcement, timing, and closing? No. We've modeled that out, Jacque. We've taken a look at how these would look with CECL and without. And other than the optics of a messy quarter when you make an announcement, it's not going to – it doesn't change our longer term strategy and how we feel about acquisitions. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. You're welcome. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Coffey from Janney. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Tim. Randy, as we kind of look at your interest-bearing deposits, do you have the opportunity to reprice those in the next quarter? I mean, is it something that the markets provide you an opportunity to do from a competitive standpoint? The core deposits, I think, are pretty stable. I think you saw us, we didn't move a lot when rates went up. It didn't move a lot when rates came back down, and that's kind of our contract with our customers. We're a steady stable and I don't see really much change there. Okay. And in regards to the loan-to-deposit ratio, is there a level that you want to keep it at, because it looks like it's going to be under pressure a little bit here at least in this next quarter. But going to 2020, 2021, is there kind of a bottom level that you would like it to kind of be able to stay at? Well, loan-to-deposit actually improved this quarter with the addition of Heritage. So, I'm real happy to see that. It's under 90%, and don't see a big change in that going forward. We like kind of the range it's in right now. We could go higher if we needed to, but probably like to keep it in this, the range it's in right now. Okay. All right. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Clark from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Hey, could you just give us the credit mark on the loan portfolio so we could just – so we could gross up the reserve-to-loan ratio? I think it was $25.9 million last quarter. This is Angela, and the credit mark for this quarter was $2.9 million. With all the acquisitions you've done, I recall it being around $26 million last quarter? Yeah. Oh, you want the total... Not (44:06)... The total discount was $23.6 million. That's what we have left to amortize. During the quarter with the acquisition of Heritage, the credit mark was $2.9, but that portfolio had such great rate that the net acquired loan discount was minimal. It was only about $8,000. Okay. Yeah. I was looking for the $23.6 million. Thank you. Okay. We don't have any more questions. I would like to turn the call over back to Randy Chesler, President and CEO of Glacier Bancorp. All right, Resty, thank you, and thank you, everybody, on the call for dialing in today. Really appreciate you taking the time and we hope you all have a wonderful weekend. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. Have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect."

         "Good day and welcome to the Independent Bank Corp.'s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Before proceeding, let me mention that this call may contain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Independent Bank Corp. Actual results may be different. Factors that may cause actual results to differ include these identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our earnings press release. Independent Bank Corp. cautions you against unduly relying upon any forward-looking statements and disclaims any intent to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise. Please note that during this call we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as we review Independent Bank Corp.'s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website to obtain a copy of our earnings press release, which contains reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information regarding our non-GAAP measures. Also, please note that the event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Oddleifson, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you, Andrea and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm accompanied today by Rob Cozzone, our Chief Operating Officer and Mark Ruggiero, our Chief Financial Officer. Our string of record quarterly performance continued in the third quarter. Excluding M&A-related charges and a loan sale gain, operating net income grew to $51.7 million or $1.50 per share, which was above both prior quarter and prior-year results by a healthy margin. On a year-to-date basis, operating EPS is up 24% over the prior year. The star is aligned this quarter as we benefit from several advantageous items Mark will cover shortly. The strength of our underlying fundamentals remains very much intact. The quarter is marked by solid loan generation, which was masked by ongoing runoff in various acquired Blue Hills portfolios along with elevated pay-downs induced by the low rate environment, continued strength in our demand deposit generation, across-the-board growth in all major fee income categories, continued investment management success with assets under administration rising nicely to $4.5 billion, lower expense levels, benign credit quality trends, strong operating ROAs and ROEs and ample capital levels, with tangible book value per share rising another 4% in the past quarter alone. So another solid quarterly performance. Our assimilation of our largest acquisition to-date, Blue Hills Bank, has proceeded well. Integrating acquired banks as accomplice of ours is borne out by our proven track record over the years. Our combined revenue generators are now hard at work pursuing the added business opportunities presented by this merger. The more expansive mortgage platform brought over by Blue Hills has been a home run in the current rate environment. As a now $11 billion-plus bank, we are equally focused on ensuring that our infrastructure keeps pace in order to accommodate our bigger size and growth opportunities. This will require ongoing investing in a cost-sensible manner and involve deepening our risk management resources, amplifying our cybersecurity efforts, keeping measured pace in a digital space and fortifying our overall operating platform. As always, we will be attentive to bottom line considerations while keeping medium- and long-term value creation in mind. Near-term, we continue to maintain momentum with initiatives designed to sustain our progress. These include, we recently launched our credit card offering in the retail, high net worth and small business customers. We have imminent openings of two new branches in targeted markets. We're extending our sales force to our retail businesses to enhance our marketing, sales and revenue and service efforts. We streamlined our home equity application process and we've completed conversion of a major upgrade to our investment management business system. On the economic front, we continue to monitor the increasing risk associated with trade tension, Brexit and a tighter labor market. In addition, we've seen some signs of a slowdown within the national economic data. Despite these challenges, we continue to operate with a robust economic environment nationally. The 10-year expansion is continuing in the back of a strong labor market, with unemployment reaching a 50-year low in September at 3.5%. Q2 GDP is estimated at about 2% down from 3.1% in Q1. Importantly locally, the Massachusetts' unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at an incredible 2.9% with an estimated state GDP of 1.4% in the second quarter. While we have a lot going on at our company, we remain laser-focused on the customer. This extends to our product array, ease of access, service quality, the competitive stakes still keep getting raised here, but we feel confident that we have the scale, market price and brand to sustain our success. What gives us much confidence is the undying commitment and energy of our Rockland colleagues and their desire to excel. They bring such passion and enthusiasms to our customers, which has led to our superior customer satisfaction and service quality competitive rankings. All of our success is a result of my colleagues' quest for excellence and for that I am very grateful. That's it for my comments, Mark? Thank you, Chris. I will now cover the third quarter results in more detail. GAAP net income was $51.8 million and diluted EPS of $1.51 in the third quarter of 2019 reflect increases of 69% and 70% respectively from the prior quarter's results, as the prior quarter included $24.7 million in pre-tax merger and acquisition expenses associated with the Blue Hills acquisition. Excluding merger and acquisition expenses in both quarters, as well as a gain on sale of residential loans in the third quarter in conjunction with the company's balance sheet deleverage strategy and their related tax impacts, net income and diluted EPS for the third quarter were $51.7 million and $1.50, respectively, both new records for the company. Echoing Chris' comments, everything seemed to fall our way this quarter as the adjusted results reflect 6% increases from operating income and diluted EPS in the second quarter. These record earnings results drove a 1.77% operating return on average assets and fueled an additional increase in tangible book value of $1.36 in the quarter, bringing the September 30, 2019 tangible book value per share to $33.36. This represents a 21% increase over the prior-year level, inclusive of the two acquisitions completed over that period. In addition, return on average tangible common equity on an operating basis was 18.1% for the quarter. With our continued strong capital growth, modest balance sheet growth and industry-wide pressure on stock valuations, we approved a 1.5 million share stock repurchase program yesterday. Our long-term views regarding prudent capital management remain the same, and the buyback program is another tool to effectively manage capital. We will only buy back shares on an opportunistic basis if and when the stock price and overall impact meets our financial criteria. Shifting back to the third quarter results, net loans decreased slightly in the third quarter due to strong closing volumes being offset by heightened payoff activity. And as noted last quarter, this payoff activity is being further accelerated by anticipated runoff of certain Blue Hills loans. With the majority of payoff activity being driven by refinance opportunities and accelerated exit events, such as sales of properties within the commercial real estate category, that loan segment contracted during the quarter. Beyond that, strong demand continue to drive growth in the commercial construction and commercial and industrial portfolios. Further evidence in robust new business activity, the approved commercial pipeline rose to $275 million as of September 30, 2019. On the consumer real estate side, the small net reduction in balances is due primarily to a couple of factors, including the current shape of the yield curve, shifting home equity demand to more cash-out refinance mortgage opportunities. As such, that shift in demand and the company's strong mortgage production is reflected primarily in its mortgage banking income results versus balance sheet growth, as the majority of production continues to be sold in the secondary market. On the deposit side, relatively flat core deposit growth is also reflective of strong new deposit sale activity being mitigated from expected runoff in certain pockets of the higher-cost Blue Hills Bank acquired deposits as well as a couple of larger single customer outflows. From a liquidity management perspective, broker deposits obtained over the last two quarters were used to successfully replace maturing CDs within the Blue Hills deposit base, as well as to significantly reduce the company's overnight borrowing position with the Federal Home Loan Bank. With minimal impact from the mix of deposits in the current quarter, the overall cost of deposits remain relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 50 basis points, an increase of only 1 basis point. On the heels of both July and September Federal Reserve Fed Funds rate cuts, the net interest margin of 4.03% for the third quarter reflects a 6 basis point decrease from the prior quarter. And as a result of the strong loan payoff activity noted previously, margin compression was mitigated as loan accretion income on acquired loans remained at an elevated level, with approximately $3.9 million recognized in the third quarter. Shifting gears to noninterest items. Included in third quarter noninterest income was a $1 million gain attributable to the deleverage sale of $67.2 million of Blue Hills Bank's acquired residential loans. Excluding this gain, third quarter noninterest income of $30.9 million reflects a 7.7% increase from the prior quarter, as every major fee income category increased during the quarter. Some key items to highlight for the quarter include strong business momentum driving increased in deposit fees, ATM and interchange income, another very strong quarter of originating new assets under management, combined with the significant short-term single-customer custody inflow of $200 million, drove assets under administration in the wealth management business to $4.5 billion. As such, fee revenue for the third quarter was consistent with Q2 results despite Q2 benefiting from seasonal tax preparation fees. And lastly, both mortgage banking income and loan level derivative income increased significantly over the prior quarter, as both line items experienced some level of outsized benefit from the rapid decline in rates during the quarter. When excluding final merger-related expenses incurred in the third quarter as well as the second quarter, total noninterest expense of $66.8 million for the third quarter of 2019 represents a 2.2% decrease from the prior quarter. The decrease is a reflection of the company's full realization of cost save initiatives associated with the Blue Hills acquisition, as well as the following key differences quarter-over-quarter. FDIC assessment expense was zero in the third quarter due to credits received as a result of the reserve fund reaching its target level, at which point small bank credits were to be allocated. In addition, the company has an additional $2 million in credits available to be offset against future quarterly FDIC assessments assuming the fund reserve levels stay stabilized. Within the other expense category, a reminder that the prior quarter included a net loss of approximately $1.5 million realized on a $47 million deleverage securities sale, whereas current quarter activity included an approximately $400,000 write-off of other real estate owned as well as increased advertising and charitable contributions. The combination of strong fee income and contained expense management further reduced the operating efficiency ratio to 49.3% for the quarter. Asset quality metrics remained strong. During the third quarter, the company was able to successfully settle a previous charge-off claim resulting in a $1 million recovery. So to minimal other net charge-off activity for the quarter and stable loan levels, no provision for loan loss was needed. In addition, nonperforming assets remained consistent with the prior quarter at approximately $48.2 million or 0.4% of total assets We continue to move forward with implementation of the current expected credit loss or seasonal model. We are performing a full parallel run of the seasonal model in tandem with the current incurred loss model using September 30, 2019 balances. While it's too soon to disclose seasonal model outcomes, the parallel run will help us finalize and document our seasonal model over the next couple of months. I'll now provide an update on guidance for the fourth quarter. Anticipating minimal changes in the competitive and economic landscape, net loan growth is expected to remain relatively flat, while deposits are expected to grow modestly in the fourth quarter. Regarding the net interest margin, there is certainly a couple of moving pieces. First, when adjusting for a more normalized level of loan accretion, the third quarter margin would have been in the mid-3.90s range. Second, with the full impact of the September rate decrease, assuming a normalized loan accretion level and assuming no other Fed Funds decreases in Q4, the margin is expected trade down to the low-3.90s for the fourth quarter. And to reiterate last quarter's guidance, any future 25 basis Fed Reserve rate cut would expect to further reduce the margin prospectively by approximately 6 basis points. Excluding the Q3 gain on sale of loans, fee income is expected to decrease in Q4 when compared to Q3. The degree to which depends on how loan mortgage banking and swap income remain at their elevated levels, which is certainly hard to predict. Although the rate environment is expecting to keep early quarter mortgage and loan level swap demand strong, at this point we do anticipate the activity in those categories to eventually taper off later in the year. Also items such as bully debt benefits and debit card incentives would not expect to be recurrent items in the fourth quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses incurred in Q3, Noninterest expense is expected to be flat with the third quarter level. Provision for bad debt level should continue to reflect general allocations needed for organic loan growth, with no immediate significant credit concerns noted. And lastly, the tax rate is expected to remain around 25%. That concludes my comments, Chris? Great. Thank you, Mark. And I think we are ready for some questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question will come from Mark Fitzgibbon of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey guys, good morning. Good morning, Mark. First question I had is on your funding cost. I mean, you guys, you've done a remarkable job holding your funding cost, particularly deposit cost down. Are you seeing any pressure at all out there on any particular categories? No, Mark, I think what's optimistic to see is certainly the rate environment is helping to drive down some of the promotional pricing on the CD base. In particular, to our situation, we're continuing to have a transitionary couple of quarters where we have some of the Blue Hills deposit base and funding base roll off and we are redeploying that money either back into brokered CDs, or to the extent from a liquidity perspective we don't need that, we may just add some level of sort of short-term funding wholesale borrowing. So, I think in the immediate near-term, we're not seeing significant challenges in the market in terms of pricing from a funding side and I think we'll be able to hold the line pretty well on the deposit base. Okay, great. And then, I mean, I certainly applaud the buyback given your capital position and desire to support the stock if we have pullbacks in the market. But I guess I'm curious how do you think about tangible book value dilution. It strikes me that the earn back of tangible book dilution would be fairly long with your stock trading at the valuation level it currently is, could you help us think about that? Yeah, absolutely. And to that point that the decision to put this in place is really an opportunistic decision, should in the event that our stock price is at a level that we think it makes sense, obviously managing initial tangible book value dilution and earn back expectations. I think to your point, given the current stock valuation today, I think it'd be safe to say that that would infer there's more tangible book dilution than we would be comfortable with. So, this is really just to provide an opportunity should we see the price trading maybe at levels we were seeing earlier in the year, or as we continue to grow capital at the pace we are and have modest balance sheet growth, this may provide an opportunity in the future should the economics make sense. I'm just curious why not just boost the dividend a bit and as a means to deploy some excess capital? Yeah, we typically don't view that as one of our most opportunistic deployment of capital. I think we feel the buyback process is a better longer-term solution and give us a little bit more flexibility to act when we think it's prudent. And I think our sort of general sort of conservative sense is that we don't want to increase the dividend unless we're pretty confident we can maintain that dividend well into the future. I mean we don't want to sort of make a – increase it more than typical to sort of draw down some of the capital and then sort of bring the dividend back in line with it. (00:21:03) And it certainly won't preclude us from increasing the dividend in the future, Mark. We typically evaluate the dividend on an annual basis, and as you know, have increased it nicely in the last couple of years. And based upon our current earnings growth rate when we make that evaluation in the first quarter, we would likely come to the same conclusion, so. Okay. And then – I'm sorry. This does not preclude us from increasing the dividend when we revisit that decision in the first quarter. Okay. And then I'm curious are there any particular lending niches that you're sort of watching closely or maybe dialing back given the environment that we're in today. I'd say, Mark, it's been pretty consistent over the last few quarters in terms of constantly assessing our underwriting standards and looking for the right credit spreads. I wouldn't say there is niches in particular that we're heightened concerned about. But as you can see in our overall balance sheet growth, we continue to stay very disciplined. There's a lot of great opportunity out there. The pipeline is very strong. We continue to have very good success in our corporate banking initiatives, in our asset-based lending programs. So we still think there is good opportunity out there, but we continue to be very disciplined ensuring that all credit metrics are where we need them to be. I would say that, I mean, that the high-end multi-family, I mean, we do watch our concentration there and we feel a lot of that going on around here. So we have our eyes peeled for that, I'd say. Okay. And then lastly, Chris, you guys are sort of pretty involved with M&A and I'm curious whether you feel like M&A chatter is sort of picking up, slowing down or maybe about the same? I'd say it's about the same. A lot of chatter and I don't count on anything until something actually lands on my desk. And we certainly are super – now we've been on a – sort of our trend is one every 1.5 years or so for the last 15 years. And I would hope that will continue. But you never really know. So, we just focus on what we can focus on right now is that really the crossing the $10 billion to really firming up our operating base and making some infrastructure investments and getting ready for the next opportunity. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Bishop of D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Dave. Good morning. Maybe circling back to Mark's question, every so often I am speaking to clients, there's some angst about maybe just the supply/demand balance maybe in the Greater Boston or Boston market there. Just curious what you're seeing within that market in terms of the overall health especially on the commercial real estate side? Yeah, I think to Chris' point, certainly that there's pockets of real estate deals where there's an element of concern over valuations and looking at making sure we feel good about that coverage service ratios. So, we're certainly heightened in terms of understanding that dynamic in today's marketplace, but I think in terms of opportunity, we continue to see plenty of opportunity in that market. We've continued to expand and bring on a couple of new officers that have good ties in that market. So, I think there's still opportunity there. We just continue to be very selective over which ones to go after. Got it. And then from a pricing perspective or I guess interest rate risk perspective, any sense that in terms of loan portfolio how many are at floors or maybe hit floors within the next one or two rate cuts? Yeah, so just a reminder there, David, what we've done over the last couple of quarters is put in place a macro level hedge program to address obviously the primarily our swap booking and other variable rate loans. So, as of September 30, we have $750 million of hedges available to protect on rates going down. $550 million to $600 million depending on a couple of basis points of where LIBOR is today are already in the money and have already provided protection on further rate cuts. The other $150 million to $200 million will provide coverage over another cut or two. So, on the commercial book, we feel very good about how we've been able to effectively mitigate much of the risk for rates going down. On the consumer side, we've also been very successful in getting floors on our home equity generation and new home equity loans. So those are already originated with floors on them that will vary depending on the timing, the rate environment at which they originated, but there's also good protection on that portfolio as well. Got it. And then one final question on the FDIC assessment credits. I think you said you had $2 million available, should we see that offset the assessment of the fourth quarter as well into 2020 before being used up some mid-year? You're right. So assuming the reserve stays at that level, the credits are available to be utilized. We've been running out about a $750,000 to 800,000 per quarter expense charge. So, to your point, if you just do the math, that would be able to absorb 2.5 quarters worth of expense. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi, good morning. Good morning, Laurie. How are you? Great, thanks. Mark, just wanted to go back to your comments around margin, how you were talking low-3.90% range for fourth quarter. Can you just share with us what your accretion income assumption is for fourth quarter? Sure. So, for the fourth quarter that range that I provided would assume a sizable decrease in accretion income. It is a tough number to predict as you can imagine. But as we guided and I believe talked about last quarter, I continue to sort of peg our normalized accretion level in the $2 million to $2.5 million on a quarterly basis. So, should that level come in that range that would equate to the low-3.90% margin that I guided. Got it, okay. That makes sense. And then I guess in terms of accretion for full-year 2020, how should we be thinking about that, because that does run down pretty quick? It does. I think it will certainly be dependent on payoff activity and that's been the biggest driver over the last couple of quarters. So, a little of that would be predicated on whether this environment continues to foster accelerated payoff and runoff activity. But certainly my guess would be going into 2020, we should certainly see the accretion income come down to sort of those normalized levels that I just alluded to that were included in the fourth quarter guidance. Okay, right. And then if we're thinking – oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. It's tough to get to an actual number just because of the payoff volatility. Sure. No, that make sense. And I guess if we look at core margins, so if I just, if I take your 4.03% and strip out all the equation combined, the 3.88%, so you have 15 basis points or so of accretion. If we think about just that 3.88% margin as we head into next year with this shape of the yield curve, can you help us think about directionally what margin would look like if we assume two more cuts? How should we be thinking about that? Or what are – I should ask what are you assuming, how should we think about that? Sure. So just to reiterate on the earnings guidance outlook, our 25 basis point cut currently we anticipate that to have about a 6 basis point reduction in our overall margin. So I think that could vary a little bit to the extent certainly we have new production coming on at lower rates versus what some of the runoff is trading off at, so that could skew that number a little bit a basis point either way, but for the most part, with the hedges we have in place and our current assumptions over where we'd be able to move the needle on the deposit side, we estimate about a 6 basis point reduction with each cut. Okay, that's helpful. And then you all mentioned two new branches. When do those open? And are you going to be doing deposit specials, how should we be thinking about that in terms of deposit growth and also on the expense side? Hi, Laurie, it's Rob. Hey, Rob. How are you? Fine. The two branches one in Needham in December is our current expected open date, the other is our first branch in the city of Worcester. We expect to open that in January. And as we've talked about over the last handful of quarters, we are adding staff in the city of Worcester and expect to continue to grow our Worcester operation, which will include likely a hopefully a couple of retail locations in the next 12 to 18 months. But our first one there will be in January. In terms of deposit growth expectations from those two new locations, we have very modest assumptions when we think about the first couple of years of growth in a branch. So it's not really going to change the trajectory of our deposit growth meaningfully from a total company perspective, because we focus on building out relationships. We will open a new branch with a couple of deposit promos, both rate-driven promos as well as some cash offers, but spend more time getting ourselves better in the community and finding the right staff that have connections in the community to be able to really generate relationships. And so – I'm sorry, so when you think about just how those might grow over the course of the next year, are you projecting that you could maybe get $50 million per each one, given the promos or are you thinking half that, how should we...? It would be meaningfully less than $50 million per location in the first 12 months. And as we get going – let me use our Boston location as an example. We just exceeded $20 million in our Boston location and that's been open for about 10 months now. Perfect, okay, that's helpful. Okay. And then on expenses, I just wonder, Mark, if you can just take us back through on the other expenses, the $17.326 million. I know that there was a $400,000 REO. Was there anything else in there that's one-time in nature? I feel like I am missing something. We had compared to the second quarter a couple of elevated items such as charitable contributions and advertising was up a bit, but nothing specifically that was unusual or I would consider sort of one-time. Okay. And how much was the charitable contribution? That was $250,000. $250,000, okay. Pretty large. Great. Okay, great. And then Chris, just last question for you. And I have asked you this before, you certainly publicly said that you would like to be a $20 billion at some point. Can you just help us think about even with CECL coming, how you're viewing M&A, and in light of your Worcester expansion, how you're thinking about that? Yeah, well, I think for the Worcester, let me talk about Worcester first. I mean, we've had our eyes on Worcester for well over a decade, as we've thought, it was even before came into vogue a very attractive – and before the WooSox, a very attractive market. But we just weren't willing to go in until we really felt comfortable, we had the team to do it. And with the hiring of Mike Crawford, what, 6, 9 months ago, you know, like... Over a year now. ...over year now, wow, time flies. He is building out a team across all our business lines and that's gaining some nice momentum with our retail branch opening up in December. I think that really is going to bode well for us over the medium and long term. On the acquisition piece, you know what – it's a very – and if you take a look at our last 15 years and we first really had developed a formal M&A strategy back in 2004 -maybe 2004 was, it was all about being opportunistic because we really had no known competency and you had Sovereign, Banknorth and Citizens having just major apparatus mopping up banks. And so we got our start very modestly with Falmouth –  (00:35:39) and Falmouth and followed by Slades Ferry and we build up on our expertise, our performance gave us some good currency, and 15 years later the 10 bank acquisitions, 2 non-bank acquisitions, I look in the rearview mirror wherein we're saying whose acquisitions are pretty critical to achieve scale that we need today to survive, and we've been sort of in this some highly regulatory – regulated environment. So when I look now in 2019 and the cusp of 2020, I can't do anything but say that we're still opportunistic, I mean, because banks are sold and not bought, I think I don't go out on our limb by predicting that the secular trend has been underway for 35 years of bank acquisitions both nationally and regionally will continue. There will be opportunities. And with our currency I expect to be at the table and I would very much like to be there and even look at the list of the publicly-traded companies, you saw it's a limited number. Each of them has sort of the unique sort of positioning and story. And I have no predictions as to which one will raise their hands first. But I hope we're there and hope we could strike a deal. And I hope – I do firmly believe that this region would like a bank in the 15 to – I said 12 to 18 years ago – I am sorry, we've upped that to 15 to 20 years, that is a really solid as we are today, a very visible – more visible alternative to the big banks, that pretty much can offer you anything the big banks can with exception of maybe some complex international stuff. So I don't have any specific insight for you. I can just lay out the vision as I just have. And I was little long-winded, sorry about that. Thank you Chris, I appreciate it. Yeah. Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead. Thanks, good morning guys. Good morning, Collyn. Good morning, Collyn. Could you just give us an update, Mark, on where the sort of the legacy Blue Hills portfolio stands and maybe what you're sort of anticipating in terms of potential payoffs still to come in the near-term and maybe what the corresponding yield is of that? Just trying to get a sense of how far into this process you guys are? Sure, so in the third quarter the payoff activity across the board from Blue Hills was around $90 million, so similar to what we – I believe we talked about in the prior quarter we were anticipating about $100 million of continued payoff activity. And going into the fourth quarter, we still anticipate some more pay-down and payoff activity associated with that portfolio. And as we look at it today, I would gauge it's in that $75 million range, again, going into the fourth quarter. Now this isn't primarily on the commercial book side. The residential portfolio, as you know, we had already carved out a portion that we were looking to sell as part of the deleverage strategy last quarter, that sale executed in the third quarter and those loans are off the books. That portfolio is naturally going to a trade just with normal paydown activity. And as we're continuing to put most of the – as we're continuing to sell most of the production, balance sheet additions on the residential side would be somewhat limited. So that portfolio we'd just naturally trade down and that will be combined with some expected payoff on the commercial book as well going into the fourth quarter. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of, I completely understand and appreciate the volatility within the mortgage banking line and the derivatives line and hard to predict going forward, but can you just give us an update as to where you've expanded the resources to support each of those businesses? I mean, we knew obviously with Blue Hills, they brought a great platform and that was going to be kind of a focus for you guys. You've been building out the commercial strength as well on your side. So just kind of sort of give us a little bit background as to what the resources look like now that are supporting each of those businesses going forward? Sure. Hi Collyn, it's Rob... Hey, Rob. ...and I'll speak to mortgage first and then Mark can talk little more about commercial and I can add color if needed. On the mortgage side, in terms of the actual sales staff, we essentially doubled the sales staff or less than double, we went from just over 20 to about 40 in total number of originators. Blue Hills' former originators were much more heavily geared towards self-sourcing and not necessarily partnering with the branches on the existing deposit customer base like legacy Rockland Trust loan officers often do. So we had a combination of increased LOs with access to more COIs, because Blue Hills' loan originators leverage relationships with real estate agents, attorneys and the like. So lot more of their production is coming from a non-customer perspective. So we've been able to combine those two, not dilute the combined production, because we're not fishing off the same peers and really leverage what we've been able to do. So, total production in the third quarter was $275 million, a healthy record for us certainly. On the support side, we've obviously had to add to the former Blue Hills operations team just to deal with the combined volume, but the scale effects in the mortgage business are very strong. And so we've only at this point added a handful of individuals. We have a couple of open positions pending. But – it's to the tune of about six or seven I think in total that we've had to add to the operational team to support this increased production level. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just to add color on the loan level derivative program. I guess I wouldn't necessarily say there is this added cost or resource allocation that's needed to that. As you know, we've had a low level swap program in place for a number of years already. The commercial lenders are very familiar with that program. Our treasury team is very much involving and taking a look at those opportunities. So really that growth is primarily just a function of the rate environment and our customers taking advantage of what the yield curve is providing for them in making a decision to actually go ahead and get some fixed rate pricing at rates that are very compelling in this environment. So that's a program that we've had in place. We've continued to utilize it. It's primarily the current rate environment that's driving out those elevated numbers. And from a resource allocation, it doesn't require much of a change of anything Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just more broadly as we look into next year, how are you guys thinking about just balancing of growth and margin specifically, obviously, any assets that you're putting on the books today is going to be margin-dilutive from where you are, how do you think about that in terms of just their trajectory of growth from an organic standpoint? Obviously, Chris, I get it from an M&A standpoint. But just thinking about the incremental asset add in this rate environment as we look into next year? Yeah, there's a lot of factors to consider, Collyn, and certainly where we are, if we believe all of the reports and the data are out there, are we in the late innings of the expansion. So certainly we're cognizant of being careful about our growth and selective about our growth on the loan side. And to be honest with the challenges of the rate environment, it's tough to look at opportunities and bring on long-duration assets at fixed rates that we feel just doesn't make a lot of long-term economic sense. So, a couple of headwinds on that front certainly challenge our growth initiatives. But as I said earlier that the pipeline is very strong going into the fourth quarter. We continue to see a lot of opportunity. So, in the event paydown or payoff activity starts to taper off, that would just naturally equate to maybe a little bit more growth than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, but certainly where – we enter into 2020 very cautious, continuing to protect the margin and taking credit concerns into consideration in each deal that we're looking at. So, naturally we're not going to, as I sit here today, I don't think we'll be going out with 2020 guidance of double-digit loan growth for this fact. Thank you, Mark. I'm like have you ever given double-digit loan growth guidance? Okay, all right. That's helpful color. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And our next question will come from Bernard Horn of Polaris Capital Markets, Please go ahead. Hi, Bernie. Well, Andrea, I think he's dropped off. Bernard, your line is open. Do you perhaps have it muted on your end? Okay, Andrea. We'll reach out to Bernie offline to see if he has a question. You still there? Okay, if that's the case, this concludes our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Oddleifson for any closing remarks. Great. Thanks, Andrea and thank you everybody for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a good weekend, bye. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 3, we announced our third quarter financial results this morning, reporting EPS and ROE of $1.42 and 9.7%, respectively. Before I go into more detail about our results, I'd like to discuss what we're seeing in the macro environment. As one of the world's largest investment service providers, we have a unique window into global capital flows. Despite an accommodative monetary policy supporting US equities and global fixed income assets, a significant amount of cash remains on the sidelines. Notwithstanding that, both industry and client flows have improved in recent quarters relative to 2018. Relative to the year-ago period, State Street's total revenue fell 3%, reflecting lower interest rates, weaker international average equity market levels and challenging industry conditions, including price compression, partially offset by the positive contribution of Charles River. When compared to the second quarter, however, total revenue increased 1%, driven by higher servicing fees, stronger net interest income and better foreign exchange revenue. We are encouraged by the direction of our servicing fee revenue and believe that our efforts to improve revenue performance are having the intended impact. We are making progress, we are not yet where I would like to see us as a business and reigniting servicing fee growth remains a priority. Assets under custody and administration increased slightly quarter-on-quarter to $32.9 trillion and we are pleased with the level of new wins during the quarter of $1 trillion, while assets yet to be installed increased to $1.2 trillion. At Global Advisors, we also had a good quarter. Assets under management increased by 1% quarter-on-quarter to just under $3 trillion, supported by higher period-end market levels and relatively strong ETF and cash inflows. I'm particularly pleased by the third quarter of consecutive net inflows. We are making good progress across the enterprise, but we are not yet hitting our full potential, which is why reigniting servicing fee growth remains a top priority. I would like to provide you now with an update on some of the strategic progress we are making to improve our revenue growth, as well as our operational efficiency. First, regarding reigniting servicing fee revenue growth, we are seeing some tangible progress as demonstrated by this quarter's performance. Part of this initial success is due to a strengthened focus on our clients. We have made some appointments in key strategic areas of focus, such as with the recent announcement of our new head of US Asset Owner Relationship Management. In addition, we have expanded our management committee in recent months, adding to the diversity of our leadership and talent. Furthermore, we are taking steps to improve client service quality by reassessing and leveraging the capabilities of our newly combined operations and technology division. Regarding operational efficiency, expense management remains a key focus for all of us. As a result of ongoing process reengineering and automation efforts, we have been able to reduce high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, already exceeding our initial target of 1,500 by year-end. Furthermore, our $400 million underlying expense savings program for full-year 2019 has already achieved $275 million in total year-over-year gross savings in the first nine months of the year. You'll recall that last quarter, I announced that we are in the process of updating our core business strategy to help us return to stronger revenue growth, as well as conducting a fundamental reassessment of our technology ecosystem in order to improve our operational efficiency in the near-term. This reassessment is underway and we have taken early actions in this regard. In recent weeks, we have rationalized some of our technology head count. There are a number of areas we are examining to create better technology outcomes at lower cost, with an increased emphasis on development projects and innovation that have a direct client service benefit and strengthen our resiliency. We continue to expect that we will be able to provide further detail on our reassessment later this fall. Our vision remains becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world capital. Our front-to-back platform, which we have branded Alpha, is key to achieving that vision and our financial targets over the medium term. This Alpha strategy is facilitating deeper client relationships, allowing us to increasingly become their essential partner, while delivering operational efficiencies to both our clients and State Street. Our front-to-back asset servicing platform continues to have a strong pipeline with a number of clients and exclusive negotiations. The level of client engagements remains at an encouraging level. Regarding shareholder return, following our strong performance under the 2019 CCAR stress test, we recently announced an 11% increase to our quarterly common dividend to $0.52 per share and returned approximately $690 million to shareholders, including $500 million of common share repurchases during the third quarter. We expect the changes to regulatory capital requirements will support our ability to return additional capital to our shareholders in the future. To conclude, our immediate focus is on delivering world-class client service, while finding ways to reignite revenue growth and generate expense reductions through sustainable improvements in our operating model. We are making progress in all of these areas. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on page 4. On the top left panel, we show our GAAP results as well as certain results ex-notable items in the bottom for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. On the right panel, we summarized notable items which amounted to $45 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share in the third quarter, consisting of $27 million in acquisition and restructuring cost, primarily from Charles River, as well as $18 million in legal and related expenses. The A&R costs are in line with our expectations and are helping us deliver on anticipated CRD expense synergies. For period-on-period comparisons, recall that we had no notables in the third quarter 2018, but we did have $12 million of A&R on a pre-tax basis equal to $0.03 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to Charles River. Turning to slide 5, we saw period-end AUC/A levels decline 3% year-on-year and up slightly quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year move was driven by the impact of a previously announced client transition, partially offset by higher spot market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the modest AUC/A increase was mainly due to higher spot market levels and client flows, partially offset by the same previously announced client transition. In regards to the transition, recall that this was immaterial to quarterly revenues since the end of 2018 and we do not expect any further material revenue drag. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter on just about $3 trillion driven by higher US market levels and strong net flows. Third quarter 2019 saw net flows of approximately $13 billion, driven by cash products and ETFs, the third consecutive quarter of positive inflows. Moving to slide 6, servicing fees were down 5% year-on-year, but down just 3% year-over-year ex-FX. As Ron discussed, while challenging industry conditions persist, the pace of quarter-over-quarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in the third quarter, with this quarter's results showing a sequential increase, primarily driven by higher average market levels, net new business and some market-based catch-up accruals. And while two quarters are not yet a trend, we continue to believe that the actions we have taken since late last year, including the rollout of our new client coverage model and the newly formed Executive Review Committee to strengthen pricing discipline, are having an impact. Nevertheless, as Ron also mentioned, we remain unsatisfied with these servicing fee results and recognize that still more needs to be done to reignite revenue growth. On the bottom-right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $1 trillion in the third quarter, which also raised our assets to be installed. The sizable wins this quarter demonstrates the benefit of our scale and capabilities, including a mandate from an existing large client as we continue to grow our relationships. Turning to slide 7, let me discuss the other revenue line. Beginning with management fees, third quarter revenue was down 6% year-on-year, driven by the ongoing impact of the late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher fee products, partially offset by higher average US equity market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1%, driven by higher average US equity markets, increased day count and good inflows. FX trading was down 1% year-on-year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter as the business benefited from a volume and volatility uptick in August relative to the prior quarter. Securities finance revenues were down 9% year-on-year, modestly reflecting the CCAR-related balance sheet optimization made in the second half of 2018 and down 8% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to the absence of 2Q seasonal activity. Underlying the seasonality, we are seeing some stability as our new optimization actions will position us for growth as we see client demand rebuild. Finally, processing fees were up year-over-year reflecting approximately $77 million in revenue contribution from CRD. Quarter-on-quarter, processing fees were down 15%, driven by lower market-related adjustments as well as lower CRD revenue due to the timing of new business and renewals. Moving to slide 8, you will see in the top left panel a summary of CRD's operating performance in the third quarter, generating $85 million of standalone revenues on $56 million of operating expenses, resulting in $29 million of pre-tax income. The business also saw $5 million in new client bookings during the quarter, all external. While revenues were a bit lower this quarter due to the timing of new business and renewals, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations. The uptick in operating expenses in the quarter was anticipated and driven by a planned increase in investment spending to support new business growth. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue reporting standards and not to read across any one quarter's results. Turning to the upper-right panel on this page, we wanted to again provide you an update on our active client discussions regarding CRD. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaged with approximately 130 clients, representing approximately $41 trillion in assets. As anticipated, these dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities and we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. On the bottom two panels of the page, we've again listed some of the growth and synergy milestones achieved this quarter. As mentioned earlier in the call, our front-to-back pipeline remained strong as we saw an increased number of clients in exclusive negotiations and expect more announcements to come. These front-to-back deals will also help drive growth in our core servicing business as they typically come with some combination of custody, accounting and middle office revenues, in addition to Charles River-specific revenues. Turning to slide 9, NII was down 4% year-on-year with our NIM declining 6 basis points. On a sequential basis, however, our NII was up 5% with our NIM increasing 4 basis points. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by episodic market-related benefits worth about 3 percentage points as well as higher client repo activity and active deposit management. Absent these episodic benefits, NII would have been about – up 1% sequentially. We have been seeing some success in our deposit gathering initiatives with our average total deposits growing for the second straight quarter. These initiatives include a variety of efforts such as sweep program minimums, targeting new client segments and adding market-ready funding. This active deposit management may help us offset a portion of the impact from deposit rotation in some quarters. We were particularly pleased with our success this quarter in that regard, but we still expect to see continued gradual deposit rotation and the effect of lower long rates. We also responded quickly to Central Bank rate reductions both in the US and Europe with appropriately aggressive deposit pricing actions. And finally on the earning assets side, we continue to target careful growth in client lending and a modestly larger investment portfolio. On slide 10, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex notables. So the trends are readily visible. Year-on-year, our expenses excluding notable items were up 2%, but down 1% excluding Charles River and down slightly quarter-on-quarter. We've also now seen three consecutive quarters of total head count declines, driven by the ongoing reduction in our senior ranks and the previous hiring freeze implemented earlier this year that have reduced our high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, exceeding our original target of 1,500 by year-end. The cumulative impact can be seen in our compensation and benefits line, as it is now down 2% year-over-year or down 4% excluding Charles River. As we've been able to move, we're up to lower cost global hub and achieve greater efficiencies via automation, while actively improving client service levels. Moving to slide 11, we wanted to show a full-year view of underlying expenses, which excludes Charles River, categorized by IT, operations, as well as business segments and corporate functions, but you can see where we are delivering expense reductions and where we still see incremental opportunities going forward. As you can see, due to our ongoing cost management efforts for 2019, we expect to achieve year-on-year expense declines in two of these three major areas, with significant efficiencies realized in operations as well as our business and corporate functions. As we said last quarter, the growth in our IT spend is too high and that is where we are in the midst of the top-to-bottom review Ron mentioned earlier in his remarks. In fact, in IT, we have already identified a number of optimization opportunities through this technology reassessment and have taken some early actions including rationalizing approximately 275 staff this quarter. We remain confident that we can continue to realize the incremental benefit from automation initiatives while delivering improved service quality and expect to share more detail on this assessment and its potential efficiency opportunities before year-end. Moving to the right side of the page, we remain on track to achieve $400 million in expense savings this year, having already realized $275 million savings year-to-date via mix of resource discipline and process engineering efforts, resulting in an anticipated 1.5% reduction in our full-year underlying expense base year-on-year, which surpasses our original start of the year 1% reduction target. Moving to slide 12, our capital ratios remain largely consistent quarter-on-quarter with our standardized CET1 at 11.3% and our Tier 1 leverage at 7.4%. We returned a total of approximately $690 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, $500 million of which were share repurchases. The $690 million is a 45% increase from the $475 million returned in 2Q 19, as we began to execute on our 2019 CCAR plan and deliver on our priority of significantly increasing our capital return to shareholders, and the $690 million represents 130% of net income available to common shareholders. On the left side of the page, you will see that our investment portfolio grew sequentially as we reinvested cash and maintained significant CCAR stress capacity. I would again note that we are confident in our capital position, believe that we have created some headroom and that as proposed changes to leverage ratio rules are being finalized, we will continue to examine associated capital optimization opportunities. Moving to our summary and outlook on page 13, we were pleased to see the continued moderation in servicing fee headwinds during the quarter and our global FX business provided better than expected revenue results. NII increased 5% sequentially, driven by some episodic market-related benefits, and we saw deposits stabilize in the quarter due to our deposit gathering initiatives. Deposits are tough to predict of course quarter-on-quarter, and prevailing rates continue to trend downwards. The underlying expense reduction we've achieved to-date demonstrates our ability to further bend the cost curve as we've now reduced our total head count 2% year-to-date and are on track to achieve this year's updated expense savings target of $400 million. Finally, we began to deliver on our priority of increased capital return to shareholders and believe we are well positioned to continue to optimize our capital stack consistent with regulatory development. In closing, I'd like to cover our 4Q 2019 outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, we currently expect fee revenues to be up 1% to 2%, driven by CRD, assuming third quarter 2019 end of period market levels. We expect servicing fees to be flattish in spite of the third quarter catch-up accrual as pricing pressure continues to stabilize, while management fees are expected to be up a percentage or two driven by the carryover of strong inflows from this quarter. And while markets are always difficult to forecast, we currently expect our market businesses to be down somewhat assuming lower levels of volatilities in the third quarter, while processing fees are expected to be up sequentially, driven by fourth quarter seasonality in Charles River and the absence of some market-related adjustments. In regards to NII, we will continue to see downward pressure from the declining long rates, and with another rate cut, we would expect to be down 3% to 5% on a sequential basis excluding the $20 million of episodic benefits we experienced in the third quarter. On expenses, we expect expenses excluding notable items and including CRD to be flattish sequentially. At the same time, we remain confident in achieving our full-year underlying expense reduction of 1.5% year-on-year excluding both notable items and Charles River. And as we mentioned previously, we are conducting a fundamental review of our technology cost structure and expect to have more information to share with you later this year. Finally, we expect to see the full-year tax rate come in at the lower end of our tax guidance of 17% to 19% for the full year. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Ron. Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open to questions. Your first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thanks. Hey, good morning, everybody. So maybe starting with the question around servicing fees, obviously nice to see commentary around moderating pricing pressure again here. Maybe give us an update where that stands, I think 4% down is kind of how we're thinking about 2019. As you're looking to 2020, how do you expect these pricing pressures to evolve? Alex, it's Eric. It's early to take a full-year look at 2020, but I think we've started to see a couple quarters here some moderation in 2019. So in the second quarter, we began to see some those early signs. They continued this quarter as well. And as we have reviewed the book of some of the larger than historical pricing concessions, you recall, we were tracking the top 100 clients. We're now through 75%, 80% of that book. And then that gives us an ability to begin to look forward into fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of next year, and as we look forward into those time periods, we continue to expect the moderation to continue. That's the kind of the indicator. So I think if we step back and ask the broader question for what's driving some of those changes, I think there're really two things. I think on one hand, we're beginning to see the effects of our coverage teams and how we have upgraded our coverage force to better cover clients and bring together the full set of discussions in one place. And then with our Executive Review Pricing Committee, we've actually brought up the pricing decisioning to literally just a handful of senior executives. And that's given us the ability to influence the amount and the direction of those pricing adjustments, and at the same time actually we're collaboratively with our clients around where there is incremental business to be brought on. And I think what we're starting to see is the effect of that senior control and engagement have its effect on the revenues in these quarters. Got it. Thanks for that. And then my second question is around servicing fees again, but maybe a little bit more specifically related to the quarter. So, obviously $1 trillion in wins is a big number, $1.2 trillion pipeline is a big number. Definitely appreciate the effort to sort of communicate the drivers of servicing fees in a more transparent fashion, but in the past, we've seen big AUM, AUC numbers, but the translations  that are in the fees (00:24:33) have been sort of overwhelming. So can we talk through maybe the impact of these wins on the revenues and ultimately the timing of when that's going to hit? Thank you. Alex, it's Eric again. I think as you'd expect in our business, our business is lumpy and it also comes with a range of different wins and new business engagements. I think it's hard to predict for any one quarter what the effect will be on future revenues. And I think we've been quite clear in the path and sometimes we have large wins that start with one particular product, sometimes we have larger or smaller wins that come on with multiple products and sometimes we see the follow-on activity. So it's hard to directly translate and I think the other texture that I shared with you is that our business is multifaceted across products and regions, and we've talked before pricing differs by region, emerging market versus the US; pricing differs by product, some of the cross-border funds versus some of the most typical 40 Act mutual funds. So, hard to be emphatic about the exact correlation of revenues, but what I would say and one of the reasons we do track the AUC/A wins is we think it gives you an indication of client engagement. We're having the amount of client activity and business, and over time that will flow into revenues. Exactly when and how much, that's something that you will see in the coming quarters. Alex, it's Ron. What I would add to that is that we are very encouraged though by that number. There is a large existing client win in there, which reflects the trend that we've talked about for a long time which is around outsourcing. But also in that number is a broad-based very high quality clients that we think are just adding measurably to our book. Okay. Thanks for that additional color. Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open. Hello. Just a couple of combined deposit rate-related questions. First, just definitionally, the down 3% to 5% next quarter, the base that we start from as we take out the 20% this quarter and then take it down 3% to 5% just making sure. Glenn, it's Eric. That's correct. That's the way to think about it. Okay. Cool. On the – if you look at your average non-interest-bearing deposits, they're down 17%. A lot of peers have seen similar numbers, but there are only down 1% quarter-on-quarter. And I'm curious if you think we are at a more – we are entering a bottoming stage. This is a more natural percentage of the overall book or does that accelerate as we have more rate cuts. Just curious how you're thinking about that. Glenn, it's Eric. I'd like to see a couple more quarters here before we make a judgment around the direction of non-interest-bearing deposits. I think we've seen a consistent reduction, I think, about over the last two years and this is kind of 15% to 18% to 19% range. It's been a little bit lumpy in some of the previous quarters. I think you can look back a year ago, it's a little bit lumpy up and then lumpy back down and back to trend. So it's hard to read into one quarter's performance exactly what the future holds. I think we'd like to see a couple more quarters and we'd like to see a couple more quarters actually at these new prevailing rates, because remember, part of the driver for the rotation was the higher rates that Fed had brought us to now that they've cut rates a couple of times and they continue to cut, the differential between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing becomes smaller and so that may have an effect as well. So I think we were pleased with the results this quarter on non-interest-bearing. We were pleased with the results on interest-bearing as well, because we were able to manage pricing quite actively as the Fed and the ECB cut rates, and I think we're going to be watching this one closely, I think, with everyone else. Cool. Definitely helpful. Glenn, I would add to that – it's Ron here – that somewhat analogous to how we're managing servicing fee pricing, we are managing deposits and deposit pricing very intensively at a client-by-client level, so well, nobody is happy with the trends that we're facing in the environment that we're in as it relates to deposits. I think the team is working very hard to manage these quite intensively. Perfect. That was my follow-up. Good. Thank you. Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually, just wanted to follow up on Glenn's questions on deposits. So the interest-bearing deposit cost dropped a lot. You referenced that, you talked about how that's becoming integrated. I think you also referenced – and so we saw the move by the Fed and the move by ECB. Is there a way to parse out the impact by currency where you're seeing betas shake out in US dollar and in euro? And can you give us a sense about whether there was noise and if you guys competitively feel as though you're sort of leading the chart, how are you stacking up versus how some of your competitors are responding? Thank you. Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that from a couple different directions. So I think you've asked the currency question and a different kind of areas of pricing on deposits, because it is one that we've been working on intensely, and just for context for you, but for others as well, right, as in the last couple of rate increases, we've got to a place where deposit betas were rising and were quite high. And what we've been able to do in this particular quarter both in the US and international is actually effectively run with symmetric betas and reduce pricing quite a bit in line with the Fed and the ECB. As we – if I were to summarize the beta analysis for the US, our betas were about 50%. So we're able to push down deposit rates quite a bit in the US as the US rates came down by the 25 basis points in the last rate move. And then with the ECB rate cut, that was a 10 basis point move. We're able to actually reduce rates even further, even more than the 10 basis points because we are really in a scenario in Europe where we are going to be negative and not negative temporarily, but negative for a long, long time and it needs to be a place where we and, I think, all banks actually can at least earn a fair margin. And so that's been part of our very active management of deposit pricing. And we'll take that kind of approach around the world as we see rate cuts whether it's in sterling or Canadian dollars or Aussie dollars or in some of the emerging markets as well. Okay. Thanks for that, Eric. And then when we think about NII in the guidance, I think you're talking about a number using the midpoint to get you right around $600 million. And yet this quarter if we're backing out the one-time, the NII was up nearly 2% linked quarter and you guys previously taken up your guide to about flattish. So I guess what I'm curious about is what is embedded in NII? Do you expect your deposit cost dynamics would be similar to this quarter and what are you expecting from an asset yield perspective? Can you kind of help us understand the composition of that guide? Thank you. Yeah, I think let's take 2Q to 3Q and then we'll fast forward to 3Q to 4Q because it gives you some perspective. I think ex the market-related adjustments on NII from 2Q to 3Q, we certainly had some downdraft from long rates. That's affecting us and other institutions. We actually had a slight uptake from deposits, so that was part of our deposit raising initiative. And we've got some benefit from our larger loan book and investment portfolio. And then our repo activity did well as well as we continue to grow some of those balances. If I then think about that from the third quarter or fourth quarter, we're going to continue to get a downdraft from long-term rates, right? That's just playing through, and it's an effect, the long rate fall from the last three, four quarters are starting to accumulate, and that's the primary item coming through. We expect to see some reduction from deposit rotation because, as I mentioned in the previous question, non-interest-bearing deposit rotation will continue. We'll try to offset that, but we'll see. And then obviously as we – whether we issue a little more debt or make other adjustments on the rest of the portfolio, there is always likely to be a little bit of other effects. So I think we're on this trend line where lower rates create some – a trend that is not in our favor. And what you've seen us do is everything we can, whether it's with pricing or balances or asset size to try to offset that. And I think what you'll find is, in some quarters, we're able to offset those – that longer trend. In other cases, we may not be able to. But that's the – we're very focused on finding ways and pushing on a number of those levers that we have to find offsets where possible. Great. Thanks for all that color. Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hey, thanks. Eric, to follow up on the cost side, I saw your guidance in the deck, just that you're expecting flattish cost both on an ex-CRD basis, and then I think that's what's implied for the with CRD basis. What I wanted to ask you about is, first of all, when do we get to that right run rate for the Charles River expense growth that we've been seeing, number one? And then number two is, once you get to the $400 million run rate also in the fourth quarter, you had this nice 1.5% decline this year and you've said that you'd be focused on still getting cost down at the core, can you continue that pace of decline as you look ahead into next year? Thanks. Ken, sure. Couple of things. I think on Charles River, we're obviously investing in that business as part of our growth strategy, and I think you've seen the revenue numbers, they tend to be a little lumpy, but we're very pleased with the early signs around some of the synergy assumptions that we had and some of our acquisition modeling that we had done that we had shared with you back a year ago. The cost will trend upwards in Charles River. I think cost came in little more quickly this quarter than – in the third quarter relative to second quarter, then second quarter versus first quarter. So it will come in in ways, but it's all meant to try to drive either sales and sales capacity or the installation engineering that we need because that's historically been a bottleneck for them to be able to recognize revenue literally bolting it on and providing the necessary integration for clients. So that's what's driving some of the cost there and we feel like that is well – those are sort of good cholesterol costs. Those are the costs that will drive current and future revenues, and we'll continue to invest accordingly. If I step back on the broader question of expenses, you've seen and we were purposeful on describing page 11 that, historically, I don't think we've been as good as we should have been or we would have liked to have been on cost. And for the last few years, we've consistently grown our expense base. And as you know, with 1.5% forecast down this year, this is the first year that we are really bending that curve in a significant way. When it comes to what we're going to do forward, I think we've said that we have to continue to work on expenses and productivity, right? There is no other course of action in a productivity focused and a slower growth industry like the one we find ourselves in. And as a result, we're going to continue to find ways to drive down expenses and what we've tried to do is enumerate the levers so that you can try to see – you can actually see the range of actions whether it's the comp and benefits side, whether it's on the non-personnel side. And we've also cut it through the different areas – IT, operations and some of our business cost. So every one of those lenses provides, I think, an opportunity for us. We're not going to start to predict next year's cost. I think that we'll spend some time on in January as we report fourth quarter earnings. But I think you can be assured that the direction of travel for our cost base has to be down, not up, and you've got a management team here that's committed to finding a way to do that. Exactly how much and in which areas and in which quarters, that's the kind of planning that we're assembling like as part of our budgeting right now and we'll be sure to come back with a good amount of specificity in January with our 2020 plan. Thanks, Eric. Ken, it's Ron. Oh, go ahead, Ron. Ken, it's Ron. Let me just underscore Eric's last point there because what we've done this year is reduced our expenses while continuing to invest in the business and create a value proposition to our client that we think is superior to our competitors. But we recognize that our returns aren't where they need to be, so what you should expect from us is more of the same and we will come back to you with specifics. Great. And one just quick follow-up for Eric. Eric, did you say – sorry if I missed it. The premium am you would expect it to increase from second to third. Can you just tell us where the to and from? And then now that we've rebased, is that at the kind of a flat level from here or do you expect incremental as you go forward? Thanks. Yeah, Ken. It's Eric. The disproportionately high premium amortization that we saw in the second quarter has begun to burn out and we're pleased with the third quarter results. And so I don't think we expect anything out of sorts at this point. And that particular part of the portfolio has now performed much more closely in line with our expectations. I think the one thing we'll see is continued effect of long rates, and that's just – that's on the overall portfolio and that's a little bit of what's driving the quarter-on-quarter guide on the NII. But nothing unique anymore as we had flagged earlier in the year. Thank you. Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Betsy. Couple of questions. One on the deposit sweeps. Could you just give us a sense as to how far along in the program you are and how much more running room there is as your clients execute on that? Sure, Betsy. It's Eric. So deposit sweeps are one of, I'd call, half a dozen different deposit initiatives that we're working on all around how do we both serve our clients as well as think about the appropriate kind of offerings, pricing and so forth. If our background deposit sweeps came out as we looked at a large pool of a particular segment of clients, what we found was that we were sweeping down to zero, which ended up causing operational efficiencies and overdrafts for clients in a way that wasn't particularly constructive for them and, in some ways, if you think about the retail world, put both the client and also the company in a position which didn't make a lot of sense. And so what we've effectively done on that particular initiative and like I said it's one of half a dozen initiatives that we have out there is just sweep down to a minimum, call it, it could be a $1 million level as an example and anything below that sits in a client account either at a low rate or – typically at a low rate, sometimes at a non-interest-bearing rate. The benefit of that over the course of the last three, four months has been on the order of just under $1 billion. So it's something that helps and those are the kind of tactics we take. We're rolling that out into some of our European geographies now. So you can see that's scaling a bit. Well, I guess I would frame it as one of the long list of initiatives to find the right way to accommodate clients, the right way to do business, the right way to create the services, but also to have appropriate value both for us and for our clients. So including all of the various programs, same kind of question, how far along do you think you're already thinking like a quarter through, half through, 75% through just looking for the legs on them? It's a good way to ask the question. I think we're part of the way through because as we roll out deposit program one, two, three and four and kind of finish number one and go to number two, we're beginning to think about what our deposit programs five, six and seven and then implementing those and then going to eight, nine and 10. So I guess we think of the challenge that comes upon us by lower rates and less liquidity in the system. The challenge for us is how do we continue to innovate and expand what we can do and what you've seen us do here is part of this is around deposits, what can we do in terms of how we pay cash and support clients with deposits on our balance sheet. And then the broader set of engagement with clients is how do you support them with all their liquidity needs. So think about the cash cascade. It's about what is the offering on deposits, what's the offering on repo and there's several different versions of repo and that's actually contributed to our NII. What can we do on money market sweeps and actually sweep more of their funds into some of the SSGA areas and that's where we've actually been particularly successful this year or to other third-party funds if that are choosing and earn a transaction fee as part of the process. So I think of it as the cash cascade, and because we don't have as large of a loan book as the more traditional regional bank or universal bank, what we're doing is thinking about where do you innovate and expand on the liabilities side and sweeps is one example, repo is another example, and so on and so forth are ways that we do that and it's upon us to continue to innovate in those areas and find ways to serve our clients. And then just as rates come down, I mean you do have clients I would expect that they are paying you through non-interest-bearing deposits. So as rates come down, shouldn't the NIB start to grow? As rates come down, they may choose – clients may choose to lead non-interest-bearing deposits. I think we don't always see that when rates come down slowly. I think we see that typically in a quick recessionary environment where certainly clients have an immediate surplus of cash, they leave it in account, I think because the rate environment has been well telegraphed here, clients are disciplined and are going to continue to be disciplined and they are going to think how much further even non-interest-bearing and we think there will be a certain amount there. I think what we're hoping is that the rotation out of non-interest-bearing slows down and maybe even flattens as rates trend downwards, but we need to see – we need more quarters to observe the exact trends in that regard. Okay. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate it. Yeah. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you please come back to the big servicing win on the $1 trillion? I guess first of all is to clarify is that all one client or essentially all one client, I don't know if you can name the client. But more importantly, what did – what were you doing for them specifically and I read it was an accounting service mandate, which is maybe clarify a little bit of what you will be doing for them now and any color on the timeline of when you will move that – start doing that function? Brian, it's Ron. We're not at liberty to name the client. Firstly, it's not all one client. So as I said earlier, there is a large mandate in there, but there was also a rich mix of both US and non-US clients, new and existing, that came through in the quarter. This was a client that was an existing client and then had chosen to outsource accounting to us and we will be implementing that sometime in the first quarter of 2020. Okay. And they were doing custody with you, just custody or they were doing mid office with you as well? They were doing several other things with us. Okay. And then maybe just on the portfolio reinvestment strategy, Eric. As obviously we get more headwinds with potentially long rates moving down over time, just can you talk really quickly about the ability to either extend duration or move more into ABS from – it looks like you've been actually taking duration down a little bit over the last few quarters and is non-HQLA constraining that or do you think you have some flexibility to improve the securities portfolio yields via the investment strategy? Brian, it's Eric. On the assets side, we really think about two drivers. We think about what we can do on the securities portfolio and we think about what we can do on the lending portfolio, and in fact the first topic that we spent time on is how can we serve our clients on lending and you've seen that grow, I think, at a better pace this year. It's capital call financing. It's 40 Act leverage fund financing. It's lines of credit and I think a nice mix of activity. And in a way it's extending our balance sheet, which clients – which servicing clients value quite a bit and it's actually probably a way to help drive some growth in NII and probably a way to solidify and actually drive some servicing fee growth. So, that's the first part. On the investment portfolio, our perspective is that as we maintain stability in the balance sheet, find ways to keep deposits stable or even grow them, there is a natural ability just to continue to invest gently in the market, and I say gently because we don't think it's a great time to add a ton of duration given rates. We want to keep a portfolio that's relatively CCAR friendly, so that means there is some duration in there. There is a well-diversified book of MBS, and then there is some – in the international markets, there are some of the high-quality sovereigns in some of the other multinationals as well. And so, in general, I think we're going to try to build the investment portfolio in terms of size, but we will do that at pace and that should be able to create a little bit of an aid to NII. Okay, great. Great, that's helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Eric, maybe just can you discuss a little bit how you're thinking the leverage ratio will evolve for you – for the trust banks? And if that's going to flip your constraining factor to CET1 or do you think it will still be the leverage ratio? And if it's the former, I guess, how do you think about what the right cushion is or the right CET1 ratio would be – with inclusive the SCB? Sure, Jim. The leverage ratio is right now our binding constraint as we operate the company more than any other factor. And we've been hardened by some of the rule make – or some of the legislation in congress that came out on the leverage ratio and then some of the proposed rule-making that was out for comment and that the Fed put out there through the spring and summer. And so we're, obviously, waiting for final rules on exactly how they propose to implement the congressional legislation. Once that occurs and we've all seen the proposed rule, so that will create some room in our balance sheet. What that effectively does is move our binding constraint from leverage back into CET1 or capital. And as a result, that should free up an ability on our part to reassess within our capital stack and in particular, the amount of preferreds that we have that form the basis for the Tier 1 capital. And so that will be the approach we take in the first stage of capital optimization. I think once that occurs, your broader question on what are the right CET1 target, or Common Equity Tier 1 target, it's something we have to navigate through, but we need to do it once we see the Fed's proposals on the Stress Capital Buffer and some of what the Fed's been describing is coming as part of CCAR later this year. And I think once we see that, then we and, in fact, other banks will have a better understanding for what kind of CET1 constraints we'll be under and what kind of targets we'll be able to run out. And I think once we see more of that, we'll be able to give you a little more of an indication of how we expect operating. Okay. That's fair. And maybe just one follow-up question on the pricing efforts. How does that work? Is it more about convincing clients to give you more ancillary business to offset some of the lower demands, the lower pricing demands, are you actually able to kind of work with some of the larger clients to keep the fee rate higher or convince them to, how does that work, I guess, in practice? Jim, it's Ron. It's a little bit all of the above, plus more. And that's been part of management discipline we've imposed here is to ensure that the conversation is comprehensive and not just about what are we paying and should it be less or more. So, some of it is consolidating business, some of it is broadening the set of services that we provide, including the discussion on, for example, Global Markets. This is all occurring against the backdrop where we have fundamentally improved our offering through the addition of Charles River. So, some of it is around that in terms of putting in place a move towards the long-term outsourcing of activities to us, so it's a holistic conversation. There are some patterns, but in effect, it's never the same, but it's all about managing it to something much more broad than what is the rate that we're paying – that the client is paying at any given time. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Hi. I guess, I'm asking for a little preview of your update before the end of the year. So, when you say you're reassessing the tech ecosystem, kind of, what does that entail? And is it – I think I saw a line you're looking to get a new CIO, is that correct? And so I guess the question is, why and why now? And then lastly, Charles River selected Microsoft for the cloud and why did you choose Microsoft? And I thought the other parts of State Street was using somebody else for the cloud, so maybe it's a hybrid model or just little bit of color on the cloud strategy, management changes and what you mean by reassessing the tech ecosystem? Thanks. Well, Mike, it's Ron. As you know, technology is fundamental to what we do and technology requirements of our business continue to go up. So we're operating in an environment where we spend a lot. We have to ensure that we're getting the greatest return on that spend and we have to ensure that we're continuing to innovate throughout this cycle. So for – what we've done to-date is get very disciplined about what's important to servicing and innovating on behalf of our clients, but at the same time, ensuring that we're getting a return on that. We're also focusing on making sure that we're operating at the highest levels of technology and operational resiliency. What that requires is an intensive management of the process not just on a year-to-year, but on a month-to-month and week-to-week, put in the vernacular, it's about running the bank and changing the bank and doing that in an optimal way. So, we are in the market for a new Chief Technology Officer, our former technology – we parted ways with our former Chief Technology Officer. That search is underway. And we'll have more to say about this later on in the year. In terms of Microsoft and Microsoft as a cloud partner, as we've talked about, I think, repeatedly with you and others, we're building out a true platform in this front-to-back offering. So, it's not just about saying we've got a new additional set of products and services, but it's an integrated platform underpinned by the data that we are uniquely positioned to provide and manage, and we want to make sure that we're building that platform carefully. So, Microsoft is the cloud provider to us, but it's also working with us to help make sure that the platform itself operates as we want it to, that it's as much cloud enabled as possible. And this was a competitive bid. We talked to basically all the providers there. And our feeling was that Microsoft brought not just a cloud capability, but an ability to ensure that our platform was going to do better than any other. And then I guess just separately, when do you look to convert State Street to Charles River? I think you had said you'd be your first client at some point. Yeah. You're talking about SSGA, State Street Global Advisors, and that conversion is underway right now. Okay, great. Thank you. Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning. Just speaking on Charles River, Ron, can you share with us the success, the conversion rates that you're having when you go in to pitch new business to a customer with the Charles River offerings versus what those win rates were for the traditional State Street business? Are you having more success or is it more challenging? Gerard, if you go back to slide 8 and we report on this – we're trying to report on this every quarter. There is a broad based set of discussions underway. These discussions are frankly more than we expected when we acquired the business a year ago. And they range from, gee, we do a lot with you already, State Street, and now we see this Charles River thing to the exact opposite. State Street, we do nearly nothing with you, but we're seeing this platform that you're building and recognize that it could help us improve our business, improve our operations and create better investment outcomes. These are discussions oftentimes around the fundamental business model that these asset managers and asset owners have. So, almost by definition, they have a different cycle than a typical RFP-driven custody assignment would be. What's encouraging about the discussions is that it's not just about Charles River, it's not just about let's bundle in Charles River to what we're doing with the client already in the back office, in the middle office. But it really is about how do we partner with you, State Street, and think about you as our outsource partner, our service provider and provide us a set of services that can help us create better investment outcomes. So they oftentimes don't follow the usual prescripted RFP kind of timeline, but we're highly encouraged by the fact that this pipeline that we've been showing you. And again, we're showing gross numbers here, but relatively few have fallen off somehow, but relatively few have fallen off and the discussions are continuing. We are – in terms of where we are now, we're in exclusive negotiations at this point with several, which is more than we expected to be when we talked to you about the acquisition a year ago. So, we remain very encouraged. And continuing with this line of thought, is there any synergies where, then if you brought some Charles River customers on to the State Street platform, could it be higher margin business or no? It's just the costs are different and you just don't see the synergies versus, again, somebody that doesn't use State Street at all and you bring them onboard, you're not going to get the synergies right away? Well, it's a mix of both. But I'll talk to you about some of the early wins here, which has been existing Charles River clients that are now using us for various Global Markets activities. That business tends to be quite high margin. By enabling a Charles River user to access some of our various e-channels in the Global Markets business, we're giving relatively user-friendly access at a very high margin to some good products of ours. Very good. And then just maybe, Eric, on the medium-term targets on slide 16 in the presentation, can you frame out how you define medium-term? Is that two to three years or five to seven years? Sure, Gerard. It's Eric. I think if you look carefully at the footnotes, we were targeting end of 2021, so that really means the end of 2021  (01:04:33) run rate basis 2022. And I think the perspective we have is those are the right targets for us as a firm. Now, we set them in the very beginning of December 2018 and a few things have shifted since then, right. The markets took a turn down and then at least rebounded, that was bad and then good. Interest rates, completely different environment if you think about where we were in the fall last year and the 10-year was at, whatever, 2.75% as opposed to 1.75% now, but we've seen sub-1.50%, and obviously economic activity out there, there is some real uncertainty whether it's with foreign trade or global growth. So, I think some real events have transpired, but if we think about our business and the kind of margins that we should be delivering, the kind of returns that we should have and the kind of capital provision back to investors, that's where we're headed. And I think our – the work we're doing is how and how do we find a way to get there and get there as faster pace as possible. And I think related to the one of the earlier questions on the call, part of our expense program this year, which then needs to translate to additional savings next year, is going to be a way to do that, as well as rebuilding the growth engine, because that's equally important than just navigating the rate environment. So, I think those we feel are appropriate and we're going to come back over time with how and how we're going to take the important steps in that direction. Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the ETF business. With the e-brokers all going commission-free, there is a view out there that this could be a big positive for the ETF space. Is that a view that you share? And if so, can you give us a sense for how you see that benefit playing out? Yeah, Rob, it's Ron. I think that anytime you're lowering your cost to the end user customer, I think it's good for the business. And then, in this case, we think it's particularly good for us because while we have a low-cost offering, we've not been on as many of the transaction – transaction cost free platforms as others. By kind of taking that out, it's enabling us to focus on where we truly are superior, which is liquidity. And if you think about the various SPY offerings that we have, they are amongst the most liquid ETFs on the planet, and in many cases, they constitute collectively a significant double-digit of exchange volume and, as a consequence, have some of the tighter spreads out there often. So we think that this enables us now to focus on where we are truly superior. So, we look forward to this and think it will be beneficial to our ETF business. Thanks. And then, we've talked a lot about pricing and the moderation you're seeing there, but I'm wondering if you could clue us in on how the pricing improvement is progressing relative to your expectations when you undertook all of these initiatives earlier in the year? Rob, it's Eric. I think we went into this wave of pricing which you remember was partly a catch-up as markets appreciate, clients come back to us, but also realizing that some of our clients were under pressure and we had to find ways to do right by them and become more efficient on our end to make it work. I think what I'd tell you is that  (01:08:51) that we could intervene and there were results that we could secure. But we weren't sure how much we could moderate pricing and at what pace, to be honest, right, because this was a bit of a new environment for us. What I would tell you is I think we were pleased to see some of the moderation in the second quarter of this year because we only really set up, for example, our Executive Pricing Committee late last year. So that's two quarters in. We're pleased to see again third quarter feel a bit better and then have some visibility into fourth quarter as well. So, I think we've been pleased with the pace. And I think it shows that if you put your mind to something and you take action and you put the right senior people and right processes, you can have an effect. Now, pricing last year and this year  (01:09:55) headwind about 4% per year. If we can cut that back by a point and get it to 3%, I mean, that's the first stage gate and that's what we're working hard to do. And I think our perspective is, we should continue to lean into our management practices and our approaches on pricing, because they're having some of the desired effects, they're having them on a relatively good pace and it encourages us to continue to find ways to do more. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of things here. When we look at the $275 million on expense savings and we're saying we're going to get to $400 million by the end of the year, how does that kind of equate, it seems like that's a little bit of a pickup and then we're getting relatively flat expenses between third and fourth quarter, is that just being offset by the growth you're seeing in Charles River or the seasonality of their revenues and expenses are tied to that. So, just wanted to see what the thought was there. Sure, Marty, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of things at play. I think if you think about the quarterly pattern of expenses last year and the quarterly pattern this year, we could begin to kind of square that circle. I think on a year-to-date basis ex-Charles River, we're down 2%. So, we're certainly running at pace relative to where we were last year and the first three quarters of this year. So, I think we feel pretty good about that. And I would tell you that expense savings come in waves. We've got very good visibility one quarter out. And so we're quite pleased that we've been able to deliver the $275 million. And we see – we have solid visibility and high confidence that we'll deliver the next $125 million and we'll put a bow around this and then begin our work on savings for next year as well. I mean, that gives you $30 million of incremental run rate  ex (01:12:14) savings that you get more in the fourth quarter which would be helpful. And then when you think of the premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities and the impact of NII, your quarterly NII peaked out about $700 million towards the end of last year and we're forecasting $600 million as we're going into the fourth quarter of this year. So, when you look at that $100 million shift, the very lowest that we got to is around $525 million when we had rates at close to zero. So, how much of the $100 million that we've lost over the last year in NII is related to the amortization of mortgage-backed securities and the premium there? And then kind of give us the accounting of what happens once long-term rates stabilize and is there any of that $100 million that's potentially recaptured as those long-term rates begin to flatten out? Sure, Marty. It's Eric. The MBS premium amortization on the – some of those Ginnie Mae pools that we had called out, that was worth on the order of $25 million, $30 million against the $600 million or $700 million that you described and that you have in our results. And for that particular pool, from 3Q to – from 2Q to 3Q, we've actually been able to cut back on the amount of premium amortization just as we've sold out a couple of those positions and otherwise seem to burnout. So, I think we're feeling good about the – how we've managed through that uptick and now have seen that remediate. I think the broader question you're asking is around what's the direction of rates that the Fed is putting us on? Are they going to cut once more or twice or three or four times? Are they going to go back to Fed funds down at 25 basis point range, because if they do that, that certainly puts pressure on us and all banks as a way – in a manner to drive down net interest income and net interest margin. I think we're just going to have to see. I think what I would encourage you to do is go back, though, take a look at one year ago, two years ago, three years ago, because I think our low point was further down and I think our balance sheet is of higher quality now and in a better position to manage through some of what we might have in front of us. Thanks. Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Your line is open. Yeah. Thanks. Just two quick questions. On the $20 million of the episodic market-related benefits that you saw in NII, could you just go in a little bit detail as to what that was and the line items that it impacted? Sure, Brian; it's Eric. So in NII, there're a couple kind of balance sheet type adjustments that we make at the end of the quarter that tend to be a little lumpy, sometimes they're positive, sometimes a little negative. They tend to offset, but we had a couple of them that ended up in the positive territory this quarter. One of them was the marks that we take on our FX swap position. And when the trades cross quarter end, and we do that just to make sure that we have stability given the volatility in some of those rates, you end up with a balance sheet mark that you take, and then unwind effectively as the trade matures. So you get a kind of, call it, September 30th, December 31st that kind of impact. Sometimes positive or negative and this time it was positive. The other activity that we do like all other banks is, we had your long-term debt. We have to test for an effectiveness and the – an effectiveness testing, sometimes little positive, sometimes little negative, again, that one was positive. So those were the two largest drivers. They collectively were about – they came to about $20 million this quarter. And in the past, they've been bouncing around, plus $5 million, plus $10 million, minus $5 million, minus $10 million, and just kind of part of what we have to book to as part of our financial process. Okay. And then a separate question on securities finance. You mentioned that you have new optimization actions ongoing. Can you just give us a little more detail as to what that is, what the potential revenue opportunity is there? Thanks. Sure, Brian; it's Eric, again. Securities finance is one of those businesses that has two features. I think on one hand, we had to make some adjustments to some of our counterparty positions in both FX and securities finance this past year as part of some of our – some of the CCAR testing and some of our dialogues with the Fed. In the FX space, we're able to navigate through that, because it tends to be a market with a large number of counterparties. You can do compression trades. You can do – you can diversify counterparties easily, et cetera. Sec finance is a little harder and I think that was one where we felt more constrained over the last year, which is why our balance – our lending balances are down and we've also had to constrain some of our activity, which has driven revenues down. What we have begun to do, though, is innovate in securities finance and find ways to refine some of our trading activities, some of our structures. We've also been innovating in some areas around peer-to-peer matching, right, that creates some more latitude for us. And as we've begun to take some of those actions, we feel like we've begun to free up space relative to the constraints that were effectively imposed upon us a year ago. And so now, the team feels as if they're more open for business. And so now, we're out there engaging with clients and part of what we now need to see is client demand come back, because as you know, there's a lot of money on the sidelines, there's a risk off sentiment. And so, as we see borrowing and lending happen in that space, which particularly is the domain of hedge funds and other market participants, once that rebounds and so which is really a kind of an industry demand and client demand question, once that rebounds, we feel like we are better prepared now to begin to grow our activity. There are no further questions, Ms. Fiszel Bieler, I turn it over to you. Thanks, operator. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay.

Now for the opening remarks, I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Western Alliance's third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Dale and Robert. I will provide an overview of the quarterly results and Dale will walk you through the bank's financial performance in greater detail, and then afterwards we'll open up the line, and Robert, Dale, and I will take your questions. During the third quarter, we continued advancing our key strategic objectives, which include leveraging our branch-light business model to drive disciplined and thoughtful loan and deposit growth; carefully managing our balance sheet with regards to asset sensitivity; pursuing accretive capital allocation policies; and de-risking our loan composition; all while being unique in our ability to drive industry-leading growth and efficiency across changing market environments. Western Alliance produced another record quarter with robust loan and deposit growth, which generated continued increases in net interest income and earnings per share. Our combination of regional banking and national business line lending drove loan growth of 19% on a linked quarter annualized basis as we saw wide-ranging, broad participation across our businesses. We achieved annualized net interest income growth of 18%, with total revenue growth of 22-plus percent, as we produced positive operating leverage, all while de-risking our balance sheet and improving asset sensitivity. This was achieved against the headwind of a challenging yield curve. As discussed on our prior earnings call, we expect ongoing loan origination volume to offset net interest margin compression and produce continued increases in net interest income. So let me go through a few of the key highlights. Net income during the quarter rose 3.6% to a record $127.4 million, or 14.6% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 4.2% to $1.24 per share and 18.1% from the prior year. Balance sheet growth continues to be exceptional and exceeded our guidance of $600 million per quarter for both loans and deposits. Total loans were $20.2 billion, an increase of $903 million, or 18.8%, on a linked quarter annualized basis and have risen by $2.4 billion over the last three quarters. On a year-over-year basis, loans rose by 20.4%, with $1 billion of growth coming from the residential program. As part of our strategic de-risking plan, we view residential loans as a thoughtful, responsible alternative to managing our loan growth, while deepening our warehouse lender relationships. Residential loans now comprise 9.3% of our portfolio. During the quarter, we also reduced our construction and land and development loans by $55 million, lowering their proportion in our overall portfolio to 10.7% compared to the 12.6% in quarter one. This puts us within striking distance of our 10% target for year-end 2020, with opportunities to balance future reductions. We had another stellar quarter in deposit growth, which really highlights the continuous strength of our diversified funding channels and overall deposit franchise. This quarter, total deposits grew over $1 billion, or 18.7%, on a linked quarter annualized basis to $22.4 billion, which is the third consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in organic deposit growth. This growth was attributable to an increase in savings and money market accounts of $1.2 billion, primarily driven by our Tech & Innovation business due to a healthy capital fund raising environment. Non-interest bearing demand deposits rose another $78 million to $8.8 billion, and over $1.3 billion of our year-to-date deposit growth has been in DDAs. DDA as a percentage of total deposits declined slightly to 39% from 40% in Q2. Overall, the loan-to-deposit ratio remained consistent at 89.8% compared to the prior quarter. Continued balance sheet growth drove healthy net interest income expansion of $11.7 million in Q3, or 18.4% annualized, while confronting yield curve headwinds, which resulted in an 18 basis point reduction in NIM to 4.41%. NIM compression was driven by recent pressure on yield curve, increased deposit liquidity, and continued de-risking of our loan portfolio, partially offset by proactive steps taken to reduce our deposit rates, all of which Dale will speak to in greater detail later in the call. Total operating revenues grew $15.2 million for the quarter compared to an expense increase of $7.7 million, producing a 2 times revenue-to-expense growth ratio and an efficiency ratio of 42.4%. We remain one of the most profitable banks in our industry and produced return on assets of 1.94% and return on tangible common equity of 19.4%. We believe our ability to simultaneously drive industry-leading growth and efficiency is the key differentiator. Our financial results were accompanied by continued stable asset quality, as the markets we operate in are experiencing some of the strongest economic growth in the country. Non-performing assets were $66 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter, and remain at near-historical low levels. During the quarter, we had net recoveries of $600,000 and loan growth in low loss categories, such as residential, which resulted in a provision expense of $4 million. Turning to capital management. On display this quarter was our ability to thoughtfully manage capital allocation between loan growth and share repurchases. Last quarter we paid our initial quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. We also continue to opportunistically repurchase shares. During the quarter, we purchased 1 million shares at $43.63, bringing total program repurchases to 3.6 million shares at an average price of $41.59. Overall, the share count has been reduced by 3.4% through repurchases since the initiation of the stock buyback program in Q4 of 2018. We anticipate using the remaining $99 million available under the current plan as opportunities present themselves. Given all these actions, tangible common equity ratio absorbed the significant balance sheet growth and share repurchases, and was 10.1% at quarter-end, down only 10 basis points from prior quarter, but up 10 basis points from the prior-year period. Tangible book value per share grew 3.9%, or $0.95, from the prior quarter to $25.60 and now has grown by 225% over the past five years as we continue to scale our business. Additionally, our asset sensitivity profile has improved. As variable rate loan floors are increasing, deposit costs are quickly being adjusted and our loan portfolio continues to shift into longer fixed rate residential loans. We expect asset sensitivity will continue to improve with additional rate cuts as more loan floors are triggered. Finally, lastly, I like to thank the 1,800 people at Western Alliance that did a fantastic job to produce these financial results this quarter. And now Dale will take you through the financial performance. Our managed balance sheet growth resulted in record earnings despite headwinds from a flattening yield curve preceding the anticipated Fed rate cuts. Net interest income rose $11.7 million, or 18.4%, annualized in the second quarter to $266.4 million, driven by a $1.8 billion increase in average earning assets, which outweighed reduced loan yield. From the corresponding period last year, net interest income was up 13.8%. The provision for credit losses was $4 million for the quarter, a decrease of $3 million from the second quarter due to net loan recoveries during the period and the mix shift to high quality residential loans. Noninterest income increased $5.2 million for the quarter to $19.4 million, as equity investment income from our Tech & Innovation segment and gain on sales of investment securities increased $2.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Non-interest expense was up $11.7 million as compensation cost and deposit cost increased by $5.2 million and $3.9 million, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in professional fees. Compensation costs were affected by increased accruals for annual performance incentive plans. Deposit costs were elevated by $2.5 million due to a single client who maintained higher than anticipated balances throughout the quarter, but whose ending balances were zero. We do not expect a repeat of this activity in Q4. We also experienced a $3.4 million loss on sales in OREO property, which was essentially offset by the securities gains. Share repurchases to-date reduced the diluted share count to 102.5 million shares, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.24. As Ken mentioned, of the $250 million authorization, we repurchased a total of $151 million, with $99 million remaining. Turning now to our deposit drivers. Net interest income rose $11.7 million during the quarter to a record $266.4 million. Investment  security yield (00:12:05) decreased 26 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.08% due to a flattening yield curve and lower reinvestment rates. Lower long-term rates increased mortgage prepayment speeds, and the resulting accelerated amortization of premium was responsible for lowering the overall quarterly portfolio yield by 16 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, loan yields decreased 19 basis points due to reduction in interest rates and spreads. Further impacting the decline in yields was our intentional mix shift toward residential loans and the decline in LIBOR, which preceded cut in the fed funds rate and prime. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased by 5 basis points in Q3 to 1.3% as a result of proactive steps taken to reduce our deposit rate immediately after the Fed rate cut. During the quarter, we lowered our rates on approximately $6.2 billion of exception price deposits with a weighted average reduction of 23 basis points. Additionally, after the Fed announcements, we reduced our stated rates on $5.2 billion of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits by an average of 29 basis points. This decreased funding cost by 6 basis points when all of the company's funding sources are considered, including non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. However, due to our decision to time rate reduction coincident with Fed rate announcements, the full effect of these actions are not reflected in the third quarter results. We expect that the effective cost of reliability funding was down to 80 basis points at the end of Q3 compared to the 87 basis point average. The strategic shift in our loan mix away from construction and the reduction in market rates weighed on the margin, but was more than offset with improved revenue from our consistent balance sheet expansion, driving a net interest income increase of $11.7 million for the quarter. Given no change in the economic outlook, this will be the theme for our ongoing performance that we can continue to earn through NIM compression. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points to 4.41% during the quarter as our earning asset yield fell 24 basis points, partially offset by 6 basis points of funding cost decrease. The largest component of the margin decline was from the sharp change in the relationship between LIBOR and fed funds during the quarter as the outlook shifted from a rising to declining rates. With nearly half of the bank's loans tied to LIBOR, loan yields began declining in the second quarter; however, deposit costs could not be reduced until after the FOMC cut the target fed funds rate at the end of July. Compression between these two rate indexes reduced the margin by 9 basis point of the 18 basis point total decline. The increase in our on-balance sheet liquidity drove another 7 basis points of the margin contraction as our strong balance sheet deposit growth resulted in $550 million increase in average cash balances during the quarter. Finally, 2 basis points of the reduction was due to de-risking our portfolio from the ongoing shift into residential loans and lower construction loans. Looking ahead, margin volatility in the fourth quarter should be much lower as the basis risk issue from the change in direction of rates is behind us and excess liquidity deployment should continue even with additional cuts to the federal funds target as expected. With regard to our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably as our mix shift primarily to fixed rate residential loans has reduced our net interest income variability due to the changes in the rate environment. Meanwhile, $2 billion of our variable rate loans are now behaving as fixed, hence the rate floors are now active after the first two rate cuts we've already had. This has reduced our interest rate risk and the 100 basis point parallel shock lower to 4.8% at September 30 from 6.6% at June 30. As we stated last quarter, we believe a ramp-down is a much more probable rate reduction scenario, which would further reduce our rate risk profile by another 60%. We believe a 1.8% reduction in net interest income in this situation is something we can quite reasonably manage through with continued balance sheet growth earning through margin compression like we did in the second and third quarters of this year. Of our $14 billion of variable rate loans, $9.3 billion, or 66%, have floors, with $2 billion in the money. With each additional 25 basis point rate cut, another $1 billion of loans with floors will be triggered, which reduces sensitivity and the shock scenario by another 50 basis points, further mitigating our recent margin compression. Turning now to operating efficiency. In Q3, we produced another strong quarter of operating leverage while continuing to invest in new products and business initiatives to drive ongoing growth. On a linked quarter basis, our efficiency ratio increased 40 basis points to 42.4%. As I mentioned earlier, a significant portion of the deposit costs and ORE expense are onetime in nature and not likely to be repeated in the fourth quarter. On a taxable equivalent basis, operating revenue increased $15.4 million to $288.9 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to an operating expense increase of $7.7 million to $122.6 million, generating operating leverage of 2 times. As the core component of our strategy and irrespective of the rate environment, we will continue disciplined expense management and credit underwriting to maintain industry-leading operating leverage and profitability. Our pre-provision net revenue return on assets was 2.44% and our ROA was 1.94%. These metrics continue to be in the top decile compared to peers. Our balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $903 million to $20.2 billion and deposit growth of $1 billion brought our deposit balance to $22.4 billion at quarter-end. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained essentially flat at just under 90%. Our ample liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet flexibility to pursue attractive risk-adjusted lending opportunities. Tangible book value per share increased $0.95 over the prior quarter and $4.90, or 23.7%, over the prior year. Our industry-leading financial performance is a direct result of the powerful combination of commercial banking relationships within our regional footprint and our national business lines. Total loans were $20.2 billion, an increase of $903 million, driven by increases in non-owner occupied commercial real estate of $346 million, residential loans at $282 million, and C&I loans of $275 million. Residential loans now comprise 9.3% of our loan portfolio, while construction loans have decreased by another $55 million and make up 10.7% of total loans versus 11.5% at the end of the second quarter. Regarding deposit growth and further demonstrating the strength of our franchise, deposits grew $1 billion in the third quarter, driven by an increase in savings and money market accounts of $1.2 billion. This growth was partially offset by a net decline in mainly higher cost CDs of $221 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in organic deposit growth. Over the past year, deposits grew across all categories, with the largest increase in savings and money market of $2 billion and noninterest-bearing DDA of $741 million. Year-to-date deposit growth has been $3.3 billion, of which nearly 40% has been in DDA. Over the past year, loan growth of $3.4 billion was fully funded by deposit growth of $3.5 billion. We believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both the key differentiator and a core value driver to our platform's long-term success. Overall, asset quality continues to remain stable. Total adversely graded assets increased $40 million during the quarter to $439 million, as special mention credits increased $36 million to 88 basis points of the total assets. From the prior year, total adversely graded assets have increased just $81 million, or 2 basis points, to 1.72% of total assets versus a $3.4 billion rise in loans. Nonperforming assets, comprised of loans on nonaccrual and repossessed real estate, increased marginally to $66 million, or 25 basis points of total assets, and continue to hold steady as a proportion of the balance sheet. Regarding the increase in special mention credits, looking back over a five-year period, loans that have migrated to special mention have less than a 1% risk of loss as it is an early potential stress indicator that has little correlation to loans becoming nonperforming. Overall, we see nothing in our portfolio that raises concerns or indicates a change in credit outlook, as we expect asset quality ratios to remain at historically low levels relative to the overall size of the balance sheet. Gross credit losses of $2.1 million during the quarter were more than offset by $2.7 million in recoveries, resulting in net recovery of $600,000, or 1 basis point, of total loans annualized. The credit loss provision of $4 million decreased from the prior quarter due to this net recovery position and the change in the loan origination mix. Provisioning related to our loan growth increased the allowance for loan and lease losses to $165 million, up $15 million from a year ago, resulting in a reserve of 85 basis points of non-acquired loans at September 30. For acquired loans, credit discounts totaled $7.5 million at quarter end, which was 95 basis points of the remaining $788 million of purchased loans primarily from the Bridge Bank and Hotel Franchise Finance transaction. Finally, we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of 10.1% and a CET ratio of 10.3%. Despite the payment of our first quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and the buyback of 1 million shares, our tangible book value per share rose $0.95 in the quarter and is up 23% from the past year. Notably, our production rate of tangible book value has been more than 3 times that of the peer group over the past five years. Given capital requirements the banks operate under, we believe that consistent capital creation is fundamental to value creation. I'll turn it back to Ken. Thanks, Dale. On display this quarter was the advantages of our diversified business model that provide us the flexibility to actively adapt our business and capital allocation strategy in response to the changing external environment without sacrificing credit quality. The combination of our regional banking and national business line lending provided powerful growth to net interest income, loans, and deposits. Our business model generates positive operating leverage, growth in high-quality loans, industry-leading ROA, ROE, and meaningful tangible book value per share growth. Within our market today, we have observed little change in business activity, as our loan and deposit pipelines remain strong. We expect loan and deposit growth on average to continue at the same level as our prior guidance of $600 million in loan growth per quarter, fully funded by core deposit growth. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, we expect net interest income to continue to rise as volume increases from residential purchases, higher earning assets, and our growing loan pipeline will overcome potential net interest margin compression, the repositioning – I'm sorry, I should say net interest margin compression and the repositioning of our asset sensitivity and projected rate actions. So, to summarize, we continue to generate robust loan growth, while reducing risk; had exceptional deposit growth of over $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter; grew net interest income 18% annualized; continue to maintain stable asset quality at historical low levels; grew year-over-year net income by nearly 15% and EPS by 18%, position the company to carry forward its momentum through the fourth quarter and into next year; and we reduced asset sensitivity and further insulated ourselves in a down-rate environment. So, operator, at this time, if you would open the line, and Robert, Dale, and I would be happy to take your questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question today comes from Michael Young with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon to you. Thank you. We ended the last call with a unsolicited comment on M&A, so maybe we'll start this call with a soliciting comment on M&A. Where do you feel the appetite is for acquisitions at this point or should we take the activity on the share buyback is just seeing a better value in buying your own stock at this point? Yeah, it's Robert. I would say probably more the latter. I mean, we're continually evaluating the best use of our capital, on a daily basis looking at a lot of deals. But as of now we've chosen to invest in our own brand and our organic growth and to repurchase our own shares. So, I would say probably more the latter. Okay. And then just on the one-to-four family purchase strategy, I'm curious if you could just talk about, it sounds like you have a pretty strong appetite to continue that as a de-risking measure. But has anything changed relative to the drop in 10-year rates and the yields you're able to get on that paper and the CECL impact, capital allocation to that, or anything like that, any changes in strategy there? No change in strategy. We still think it's a very effective method, which do extend the duration of our assets and do so with something that should perform quite well should an economic downturn present itself at some time in the future. So, rates are lower than what we were getting initially going into the program, but we're still getting into the lower 4s in terms of yield. These are really good quality underwriting at 67%, 68% loan-to-value, 760 FICO, mid-30s on debt-to-income, and we're able to this because we're buying things that maybe don't quite fit in the box from our mortgage warehouse originators that would be qualified. So, some of these are loans that have an IO period in the beginning. Some of these are loans that are not necessarily primary residences, but by well-heeled borrowers. So, we're continuing to execute on that and we think it's really helping in terms of our interest rate risk management. And there's one other thing to add to that, which is it puts us closer to our warehouse lender. So we now have another product to offer them in addition to warehouse lines, MSR lines, note financing, getting in deeper with the deposits, and now picking up some of their volume on a forward flow basis gives us an opportunity to remain close to them. The next question today comes from Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Timur. First one for me, Dale, you had mentioned a couple times that there was a large deposit on the books for the quarter that has now exited. Just wondering what's the size of that deposit. That was a little over $500 million average balance for the quarter. We still have a relationship with the client, but those deposit dollars were zero at quarter end. Okay. And then maybe sticking with deposits, certainly quite encouraging to see the drop in funding costs this quarter. And I know from prior conversations, you guys have been proactive in addressing the deposit rates kind of right after the Fed has cut. I know the full impact of what's been done already will be reflected in the fourth quarter results. But going forward that proactive approach, does that reduce ability to lower deposit costs further on additional rate cuts or are you expecting to see similar magnitudes for each incremental rate cut we see? Well, I don't know how low rates are going to go. I mean, if we got to this zero band, I mean, eventually you're going to get some compression in terms of ability to cut. But this is where the floors become so effective, because as rates get lower, a greater proportion of our loan portfolio becomes effectively fixed rate. So, it's an asymmetric kind of a return, in that if and when rates ever go up again, we should actually have increased sensitivity on the other side. So, yes, I mean, if rates continue to drop substantially in other number of cuts from here, you are going to see some compression, but the floors will be stronger. Hey, we've moved pretty quickly immediately after the two rate cuts and what we noticed is many of our competitors did not. So, I think as they catch up to us next quarter on the next cut, then there'll be less opportunities for our clients to go elsewhere and they'll see the same action among many more banks. Okay. That's good color. And then just if I could one more, looking longer term in this rate drop environment, are you guys still thinking that 1.5-to-1 kind of revenue-to-expense level is still achievable in 2020, or is that really dependent on how many additional rate cuts are going to be? Look, going forward we expect to continue industry-leading and peer group operating leverage as part of our strategic growth management programs. We have a core discipline of expense management within the company. I do not expect that to change. And we'll balance that against the delivery on platform expenses and services, and also new product expenses that we may spend. So, we'll do what's right for the company as we go forward. Appreciate it. Thank you. The next question today comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning – afternoon. Hey, maybe kind of a three part question around credit. You guys have excellent asset quality numbers, but just kind of curious kind of bigger picture kind of what you're seeing in the credit environment in terms of pricing, underwriting, and then just any additional color on what drove the increase in the adversely rated credits. Understood that's coming off a low base, but just kind of any color there. And then, Dale, just any color around CECL might also be helpful. Okay. So I'll take parts A and B, and will give Dale part C. So, general statement, asset quality remains stable. Our portfolio looks fine. We see no economic stress from the economy. As I always say, we see more self-inflicted wounds, whether it be partner disputes or companies expanding too quickly or ill-timed or poorly executed acquisitions or poor cost controls. Those drive some of the stresses in the companies that we're dealing with. As a general statement, though, I'll say that we believe we're at the top end of the expansion, so therefore, we're lending as if the expansion is coming to an end, even though this is not our opinion. So we're trying to grow safely, thoughtfully, and a very conservative, managed way. As it relates to some of the activity this quarter, I think what's important to know is our credit process and philosophy. So, our credit process is based on early identification and resolution. So we like to identify early, elevate early, and that creates more resolution options, and it also creates them sooner for us. It also garners early executive level attention. So many people are on any loans that either fall into this special mention category or fall into substandard. And so, in reality, we cycle loans in, we cycle them out, I'm really talking about special mention here, that do drive a little bit more special mentions in terms of dollars. But to reiterate what Dale said, only 1% of all special mention loans are charged off as we look at that over the last five years. So, I'd end by saying there really is no trend in our special mention composition. It's all back to self-inflicted wounds or companies that are beginning to show some weakness that we want to make sure we attend to right away. Regarding CECL, Brad, as you know, this is something that's going to be done on the 1st of next year and depending upon economic conditions at that time. But we expect a charge of about 20 basis points of our capital position at adoption based upon current situation, and that would cover both the reserve build as well as reflecting what we need to do for unfunded commitments. That's helpful, Dale. Thanks. And I know it's early, but would you expect kind of provisioning to sort of track – to keep the reserve at that resultant level? Yeah, it could be. So, if that's a 20%, 30% increase in the reserve, that provisioning, given the same economic outlook, would probably have a comparable rate of increase. Great. Thank you, guys, really appreciate it. The next question today comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. Good morning. So, question on the loan/deposit growth guidance, it just feels a little bit conservative given the performance year-to-date, especially on the deposit side, which is averaging about $1 billion a quarter. And, Ken, to your point, it sounds like business activity is still pretty good, so just trying to get a feel for why the conservatism in the guidance. So, we say it averages $600 million certainly on the deposit side. Q4 is seasonally a slow quarter for us in deposits. All right. So I keep that in mind. And sometimes, whether it be the loans or deposits, it's hard to control when deals get completed. So, for example, in Q1 our loan growth was only $400 million. So these things have an ebb and flow to it, and so what we like people to think is, on average, it should be $600 million, some quarters it'll be far more, and occasionally, it will be less. Okay, fair enough. And then just on the liquidity side, what is the – how optimistic are you that you can work down the excess liquidity? And just given the deposit momentum, is there any thought to getting a little bit more aggressive with the securities book, especially with the deposit initiatives that you have on the come could potentially build this, your deposit momentum could accelerate. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, liquidity drag could be here to stay for a decent while if these trends continue. Yeah. I mean, it could continue the liquidity drag. I don't expect it to increase from where we are. As you know, kind of how we got here for the third quarter is we had a substantial run-up in deposits going into the end of the second quarter, and that was elevated throughout the third quarter and then came down a bit as of the last day. So I would expect – and we did purchase some securities, I'm sure you saw that, too. We were... Yeah. Our portfolio was up a bit in Q3. Given the seasonal outlook that Ken just mentioned in terms of the fourth quarter, I think we're going to burn off some of that liquidity drag, and we'll look at this on an ongoing basis. Rather than loading up in securities and buying residential mortgage-backed, which is mostly what people purchase, I rather deploy it into our residential purchase program. It's certainly a better return for us. And so, we'll see how that plays out. But I think liquidity drag is likely to ebb a little bit at least. Got you. And just last one for me. The Hotel Franchise Finance, that has been growing the last year or so. I thought the plan was just sort of to maintain that or is – just wondering what's behind the increased appetite to grow that portfolio. Well, we like that product and we're growing it in what we think is a prudent way, so with low loan-to-value or loan-to-cost numbers, with sponsors that are well capitalized, and only working with operators as well that have maybe a dozen or more hotels with top brands in top MSA areas, and primary/secondary locations in those top MSAs. So when we have some opportunities and we have deals that meet that entire criteria, we put our money into our hotel group. We don't expect it to increase proportionally to the loan portfolio from here, though. I mean, we had an increase in the third quarter. Some of that's going to be sold down as some of the things going on. So I think this is a proportionately kind of a high watermark. Great. Thank you. The next question today comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead. Thanks. I think the thing that stands out for me is you have this strong organic growth and we agree in terms of our model that you can outgrow the NIM. The skeptic in me, though, is a little bit worried about the level of growth in potential credit quality associated with that. Now you have a good history in the past several years of delivering on credit. Could you give any kind of examples of maybe some of that conservatism that you're taking in terms of this growth, so that we – give folks a little bit more comfort in terms of that credit outlook? Yeah, let me start with that. I think our business model is a little bit unique, in that we have a lot of different products in a lot of different markets that we lend money to. And because we have so many different channels and types of businesses we're lending to, we can look for better risk-adjusted returns as opposed to the typical bank our size that maybe does commercial lending, commercial real estate, and consumer. So we're in so many different niches that we're able to reallocate capital on a current basis to niches that provide us protection in a down economy, and that's what we've been doing for probably the last three or four years. So, if you look at where the growth is coming from, and then you look even further within that growth at the underwriting standards, I think you'll be pretty, pretty comfortable. We have a number of things we're not doing as much of that we used to do. And so, we're just really able to kind of change where we allocate the funds, and we use that to kind of mitigate our risk and, as I said, look for the best risk-adjusted return. Yeah. Just to add a few things to what Robert said. This quarter saw over $100 million increase in capital call lines, to Robert's point, very, very low to no losses in that business product. Resort Finance went up. Again, we've never had a loss there and the team that's running that has never had a loss in over 30 years. Residential portfolio, that Dale mentioned, very strong asset quality as well. So that's some numbers maybe or examples behind the model that Robert mentioned. That's helpful. Yeah. And like as an example, some of the things we don't do as much of today, because we think that the market hasn't priced the risk properly or maybe the risk levels aren't there would be Restaurant Franchise Finance, some of the corporate syndicated credit, so Corporate Finance group. These are areas we've cut back on, because we think the market is maybe a little too aggressive on. Yeah. I'll throw solo lending in there too. Yeah, good point. Thanks, that's helpful. I appreciate that. The second question I had was just on kind of the recent weakness in some of the valuations of technology unicorns, etcetera. Are you seeing anything from your Northern California or your Technology & Innovation businesses that would be impacted by these lower valuations? So, what we're seeing is, first, they're having a very, very strong capital raising activities, and a lot of our deposit growth this quarter came from there. We're seeing loans churn at a little bit faster rate. Generally, the average maturity of our loans is 3.5 years for our entire portfolio. But it's much, much less than that in the Tech & Innovation. We're seeing some aggressiveness on pricing and structure from newly established competitors, but we're not following that because we think there's enough activity for us to pick and choose what it is that we like. And also in that in Tech & Innovation, we're putting a little bit more capital allocation to our capital call line strategy. Okay. But nothing from a valuation standpoint that would cause any kind of negative impact to your balance sheet? No. Okay. Thank you. The next question today comes from Chris McGratty of KBW. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Maybe, Dale, for you. In your prepared remarks you said, given the strategies with the floors and the deposit pricing, that the pressure on NIM might be a little bit less severe kind of going forward. Maybe you could make some additional comments in terms of severity, especially with the comments on liquidity coming down a little bit for Q4. Sure. So, these floors, we have two from our – after two rate cuts, we've got $2 billion in the money. The next one where we put another $1 billion in the money. The one after that goes to about $1.2 billion, and then $1.4 billion. So, we're gradually becoming kind of one dimensionally kind of fixed rate on our loan portfolio, should rates kind of continue to fall. And then, meanwhile we continue to have expectations that we're going to be able to respond quickly based upon Fed action. We've got another ALCO meeting set for October 30. Right after they meet, if they move, we're going to move. And I think that helped us in the third quarter and now that this shift in kind of the basis is behind us, where LIBOR is no longer anticipating Fed rate increases, I think that that will mitigate the risk that we have in terms of kind of further rate cuts from here. Okay. And with the focus on NII, I mean, if we get a cut in October, we should still – given the balance sheet momentum, you still see commensurate growth of NII that we saw maybe this quarter. Is that reasonable? Well, I think the NII growth will be slower in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, that was the inflection point for the margin change at 18 basis points. I think the fourth quarter is going to be the inflection point for the change in terms of net interest income. So I'm looking for – while the margin drop should be substantially less, I'm looking for a lower growth in terms of net interest income. We're going to get the effect of potentially as many four rate cuts that are going to have an influence on fourth quarter net interest income. The one in July, the one in September, the one in October, which we believe is going to happen, and maybe it's a little bit iffy if we get the fourth one in December, versus only two rate cuts effected the third quarter number. Okay. But even under that scenario, sequentially it will be higher is what you're saying? Yeah, we believe we'll be able to exceed where we were in Q3. Great. And maybe just one more. The expense line, the deposit costs you talked about this quarter being kind of just one-off. But if we look over the last couple years, obviously, that number has grown considerably as rates have risen. How do we think about that expense line into 2020 with rate cuts? Is there correlation that that number should come down or is kind of set in that $7 million to $8 million a quarter? Yeah, I think in the fourth quarter, I think we're going to look a lot more like we did in the second quarter than the third. If we get additional rate cuts, obviously, that will release pressure on that number, and it should otherwise lower, except that, to the degree we're continuing to move our deposit liabilities, that will be a countervailing effect. So I'm not sure exactly how that's necessarily going to sort out. But I would look for the third quarter number as being essentially a blip that will largely reverse. Great. Thank you. The next question today comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, nice quarter. I want to start on, I guess, first on expenses. The salaries increased due to the estimated corporate bonus payout that you mentioned in the deck. I know for 2018 you achieved 138% incentive payout. So I was just hoping you could give us, Dale, some details about how much you've accrued so far in 2019 and what incentive reduction tailwinds you might see, just given a tougher industry backdrop if you do just achieve that, I guess, 100% baseline going forward. Yeah. So we're north of $40 million here in terms of estimated accrual for bonuses in 2019. And that number could be variable depending on kind of what we're going to be doing in terms of performance against the budget when approved in the beginning of 2020. So, I mean, the big driver for us in terms of the change from where we were – estimated where we were at 06/30 versus now is really in demand deposits. We've got a goal in there and you can see it in the proxy in terms of what that number was for core demand, and we now believe that we're going to achieve that and we were somewhat uncertain about that earlier, and that kind of moved the needle for us. So, I can't speak to what the specific goals are going to be like for 2020. But we have the expectation, as we stated, that we're going to continue to be able to earn through kind of where we are in terms of margin compression and I think something that would set up that would enable that to be a variable item, should we fall short. Okay. Yeah, no doubt the fundamental results you guys have put up this year warrant that higher incentive comp, I totally get that. But can you tell us where that $40 million is, I guess, relative just to a baseline number for 2019? So, the baseline number would be about $30 million, by $10 million higher. Okay, perfect. And then just last from me, just on the mortgage warehouse, could you tell us what those average balances were for the third quarter? The average balance for the...? For the mortgage warehouse balances. I don't have that number in front of me. I'm going to – we'll have to get with you afterwards, Tyler. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. The next question today comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Very good morning. Good morning. Do you happen to have the spot rate on interest-bearing deposits at the end of September? So, I said 80 basis points which was a blended number including DDA. So if you back that back out, you're going to be – basically divide it by about 0.6 or something like that, so... Got it. I missed that. (00:50:41). Okay. And then just on the buyback, I guess any sense for – any change in appetite going forward, whether or not you'd like to slow that down to some degree or vice versa? Well, we said we've got about $100 million left in the authorization. And I think looking at levels of under 2 times book and under 10 times current earnings does seem fairly attractive. So, I'm not going to tell you exactly what we'll buy and how much, but the program is going to continue. Okay. And then, Dale, I think last quarter you talked to for every Fed rate cut, 5 basis point impact to NIM. If you add back the liquidity, down 7 basis points. I know the timing of the Fed cut was – the two cuts were – they weren't at the start of the quarter either. But with these floors coming into play, I mean, how do you think about that guide after you've had two cuts kind of in the rearview mirror here going forward? Yeah. I think the two cuts and the 5 bps per cut was basically borne out in what I'm labeling the basis risk that happened in the third quarter. I mean, I don't think that includes liquidity, obviously. I think we're basically on track with that. And as such, we're looking for a margin compression substantially less in the fourth quarter relative to the third. It was brought up earlier that we do have a kind of a countervailing element, that is if you get a lot lower rates from here, we're going to run into compression on the liability side repricing, which I think offsets what we're doing on the loans, and the floors related to that. So I would say the relevant range is that's still a fairly decent kind of metric, 5 bps per quarter for up to two or three additional cuts. Okay, great. Thank you. The next question today comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, Ken, can you give us an update on the deposit initiative progress? I think we ask you that every quarter and it seems to get a little better, but give us the latest. Yeah.  (00:53:07) moving along. The deposit initiative, number one, is active. It brought in balances last quarter. It held those balances this quarter. And we continue to move in a slow, but steady, pace ensuring that we have the right customer service and technology to satisfy our customers. Product initiative, number two, just went live this quarter. We just had our first sales meeting the other day planning out how we're going to grow that, so really not much to add there, although they have gotten some balances in, which surprised us all. Okay, good. And then a question on the floors. You made a comment about getting ahead of the competition. I'm just curious, are these floors that were already in place or you went out and asked for them or you're doing it on renewal? Help us understand that process. The floors have been an integral part of our credit underwriting process for years through this  whole way (00:54:11). It's only lately been a topic of discussion in a broader sense. Yeah, okay. Difficult conversations at all with clients, if you're saying your peers aren't doing this at all? Maybe, but that's offset by the reliability and convenience that we give them, and we're able to get them. I think maybe more banks use floors than you think, Jon. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's a brand-new topic for us and, obviously, Ken, you made a comment that you're acting as if you're coming to the end of the expansion, even though it's not your opinion, and the floor conversation leads me to believe you're acting as if rates are going much, much lower, even though you may not believe that. Is that a fair statement? That's right, but it doesn't hurt to have these floors. Okay. All right, thank you. The next question today comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead. Oh, thanks. I figure you're not going to use the floor here to talk about 2020 guidance or you already would have done so. But just directionally, as you think about margins and NII, assuming two or three more cuts, I would expect at some point the asset yields reset more quickly, and then you get a catch-up on the funding side, causing a longer-term lift as we kind of peer around the corner in NIM. Is that a fair analysis in terms of your balance sheet? Well, I think directionally that's right. I mean, we're focused on the net interest income. So, as we head into next year, as we've said a few times, we expect to overcome any NIM compression. We also expect asset quality to remain flat and for us to manage our expenses appropriately. I think it could play out that way, Brock. I mean, we're dialing in three more rate cuts. I think we have some skepticism whether it'll be that many, particularly if maybe Brexit gets done and a little more better results in confidence coming out of Europe, which I think has been a factor in terms of what's affected the rate environment here. But I think you paint a scenario that has some reasonable probability of playing out. Okay. And as a follow-up, year-to-date, roughly how much of the deposit growth is coming from Tech & Innovation? Give me a second on that and I'll give you an answer. And, I guess, is there any aspect of those deposits that you would flag in terms of being more volatile and perhaps tying back to what looks like a very conservative guide on deposit growth? So, answer your first question, our technology group generated over $700 million for this year. You would then look at life science added a little bit, and equity resources added a little bit. But most of that comes out of the tech and technology sector. I'm sorry, what was the second question? Second question is just, is there a inherent volatility to those deposit flows that you would call out that perhaps ties back to your seemingly pretty conservative guide on deposit growth overall? Yeah, I think that's a good observation. You can see that happen. They raise money for a reason. You can see some of our companies being taken out and purchased, which then you'll see flow through our fee income line through equity and warrant income. And therefore, our loans may soften a little bit, and then – that's incoming. And then outgoing would be our customers using their cash to buy other companies. And hopefully, we tie into loans that they need for that, but they'll use their equity and cash before they pull down on our loans. The deposit growth we've had in that sector has exceeded that of the bank overall. It's also very low cost, very attractive to us. But, yes, it is a bit lumpier and it does have greater volatility. And in some respects, a little more difficulty in terms of forecasting than some of the other elements of our funding sources. But historically, if you look at Bridge Bank over the last in excess of 15 years, including multiple cycles of money coming in and money going out, they've grown their deposits every year. Got it. Okay, thanks for the color. The next question today comes from David Chiaverini of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. First on the mortgage warehouse business, how much of the deposit growth was related to mortgage warehouse in the quarter? So, kind of the... Mortgage warehouse probably grew this quarter a little bit less than it normally does, so under 10% – sorry, they grew about, sorry, about $40 million of the $1 billion in deposits. Okay, that's good in respect of seasonality heading into the fourth quarter. And then do you – similarly on mortgage warehouse, do you happen to have the period end balance of loans outstanding? You mentioned you didn't have the average balance, but did you happen to have the period end? Yeah. It is just under $1.8 billion. Great. And then shifting back to the floor conversation, so the typical average life you mentioned for the overall portfolio is 3.5 years. Is that the same for the loans that have floors that the average life is 3.5 years? I mean, the floor loans tend to be – probably tend to be a little bit shorter. I mean, the commercial real estate tends to be a little more fixed rate, and so it's going to be on the shorter side of that, 2.5 years to 3 years, I would say. But it's an exception to not have a floor in a floating rate loan. And each time these loans are renewed, I imagine if the interest rate environment is coming down, that the floors would come down as well when a new floor is put in upon origination. Is that correct? I mean, for the most part, floors are either at or moderately below 25 to 50 basis points below the current rate using the metric of what the index do off of prime or LIBOR. Lately that's not the case. We've put on a number of loans in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, whereby the fixed rate portion of the loan is active, i.e., that rate is higher than what the index plus the spread would be on a floating rate basis. The floor is hit before we did the loan. Yeah. That's the simple way of saying it. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then final one for me going back to credit. With the increase in special mention loans, $36 million, and I know how you said there's less than 1% risk of a loss on those loans. But curious as to either what industry or a loan category kind of made up the increase this quarter. Yeah. There's nothing in terms of a concentration. It's spread out through our entire book, and I'll just leave it there. I think that's the simplest answer. Got it. Thanks very much. The next question today comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask another kind of question regarding credit. You made the comment that even though you don't necessarily think the expansion is coming to an end, you're lending as though it is. Could you square that with the 18% year-to-date growth rate? I mean, we've got a lot of banks that are – loan growth is being pulled back, estimates are coming back on growth. Are they just being that much more conservative or how do you square that? They had a couple of things that the way I'd square it is, one, we have residential loans that are a big forward flow and purchase activity, and that was over $300 million this quarter against $900 million of total loan growth. So that helps us. And also I come back to the lines of business we're in. So, capital call had $100 million of growth, a lot of banks are not in that. Resort financing had about $35 million to $40 million, lot of banks are not in that. So, Robert said earlier in the conversation here, it's because of how we're able to allocate our capital among a variety of different products. A lot of those products are not being carried by competitors. Remember, the characteristics of our national business line, very few competitors, we get pricing stability; occasionally pricing power; very, very good asset quality; and high-operating leverage. Yeah. Fewer competitors allow the banks that are in the field to have better underwriting, stronger credit. If you're just out making generic business loans, C&I loans, you're competing with every community bank, mid-sized bank, and large bank, you're going to have more stress on rates and pricing and on credit structure. If you're doing a lot of the niches we're in, you're going to be able to get much better credit structure behind the deals you're doing. Great. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ken Vecchione for any closing remarks. We thank you all for participating and we look forward to talking to you for our fourth quarter call. Thanks again, everyone. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning and welcome to the IBERIABANK Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Parker, Vice Chairman, Director of Capital Markets, Energy Lending and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for this conference call. On our call this morning, Daryl Byrd, our President and CEO, will make summary comments on our earnings report, after which, we will move into Q&A. Anthony Restel, our Chief Financial Officer; Michael Brown, our Chief Operating Officer; Fernando Pérez-Hickman, our Director of Corporate Strategy; Terry Akins, our Chief Risk Officer; and Nick Young, our Chief Credit Officer, are all available for the Q&A session of this call. If you've not already obtained a copy of the press release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation, you may access those documents from our website at www.iberiabank.com under Investor Relations. A replay of this call will be available until midnight on October 25. Information regarding that replay is provided in the press release. Our discussion this morning deals with both historical and forward-looking information. Our Safe Harbor disclaimer is provided in the press release and in the supplemental presentation. At this point, I'll turn it over to Daryl for his opening remarks. Daryl? Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid results. We reported both GAAP and core earnings per share of $1.82 for the third quarter. Given the ever-changing economy and interest rate environment, I'm extremely proud of our company's ability to produce strong financial results, grow our client base, show good gains in both loan growth and core deposit growth, while remaining focused on expense management and maintaining strong credit quality. For the quarter, both on a reported and core basis, we achieved a 1.26% return on average assets, a 14.48% return on tangible common equity, and a tangible efficiency ratio of 53%. In the third quarter, total loans increased $321 million or 6% on an annualized basis. On a year-to-date basis, we added $1.2 billion in total loan balances, an annualized growth rate of 7%. Deposit growth was also very strong as we experienced growth in all but three of our operating markets. Total deposits increased $682 million or 11% on an annualized basis with no increase in our broker deposit position. On a year-to-date basis, we have added $1.2 billion in total deposit balances, an annualized growth rate of 7%. With continued client growth and positive expectations for the remainder of the year, we're adjusting our guidance range for both loans and deposits to between 6.5% and 7.25% for the full year 2019. I think it's important to reflect on the success of our business model over the years in growing our franchise through strong loan and deposit growth and recruiting talented teams. For example, over the past 10 years, we've grown our presence in Alabama from our initial entrance in 2009 to over $2 billion in total loans. Over the same time period, we entered Florida and have now almost $10 billion in deposits. I'm proud of our ability to develop new markets and continue to see great opportunities to enhance our franchise, recruit talented associates, and grow our balance sheet. I strongly believe we're in the right markets in the southeast. As we've consistently telegraphed on prior calls, we continue to feel the impact of downward pressure on interest rates and net interest margin. Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.44% on a GAAP basis, down 13 basis points from the second quarter and 3.24% on a cash basis. We hit the inflection point on liabilities as our cost of deposits for September was flat compared to August and we've seen rates begin to decline in the first part of October. Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is our strongest in terms of deposit inflows as institutional and public funds ramp up. Further, we expect to see deposit rates continue to decline throughout the remainder of the year and into 2020. The current low rate environment has benefited our fee-based businesses throughout this year and continued to be the driver for very strong core non-interest income during the quarter. Core non-interest income increased $3.8 million or 6% on a linked quarter basis to $63.6 million, a record level for us. The increases were primarily driven by a $3 million gain on the sale of certain non-mortgage loans which is considered core along with increases in service charges on deposits and customer swap income. Activity in the mortgage business remains very brisk with gains in the quarter consistent with the prior quarter and up 37% on a year-over-year. The mortgage pipeline remains elevated at $269 million as of mid-October and provides good visibility that mortgage activity will remain strong into the last quarter of the year. Our customer swap business is also seeing significant activity as a result of lower interest rates. Year-to-date swap income is up 113% versus last year at this time. These businesses which thrive in the lower interest rate environment have helped to provide a partial offset to the net interest margin compression. Given the current projected low interest rate environment, we expect these businesses to continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter and that strength should carry into 2020. We are also very optimistic that our non-interest income levels during the fourth quarter will be at the upper end of the guidance range provided. Core non-interest expense increased $3.1 million or 2% compared to the linked quarter, primarily driven by write-off of long-lived assets, again, a onetime expense but still considered core. Excluding the write-off, total core non-interest expense increased less than 1% from the prior quarter. Our core tangible efficiency ratio remained strong coming in at 53% for the third quarter. We have been and continue to remain extremely diligent around expenses. We continue to allow the investment portfolio to compress as we fund additional growth in loans. At the end of the quarter, the investment portfolio was approximately 14% of total assets. We continue to see this as a benefit to our margin and anticipate employing this strategy for at least another quarter. The banks credit metrics remains strong and stable. Classified assets continue to decrease and now represent 89 basis points of total assets. Additionally, net charge-offs for the quarter were $8 million or 14 basis points of average loans, the same as in the prior quarter. We see no signs of credit deterioration in the loan portfolio. We also believe our credit culture has and should continue to benefit us if we encounter increased uncertainty in the economy. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 552,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $72.46 per common share or approximately $40 million in total value. As a reminder on July 17, 2019 we announced a new common stock repurchase plan of up to 1.6 million shares or approximately 3% of our outstanding common shares. There are currently approximately 1.2 million shares remaining in the plan, which we expect to complete over the next three quarters. For the first nine months of 2019 through a combination of cash dividends and repurchases of our common shares, we have returned approximately 94% of net income to common shareholders. As we continue to look at the projected rate environment, we have again revised our full-year 2019 guidance to account for another 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate, which we expect to occur this month. This follows the recent cuts in July and September that we already had factored in for 2019. As you can see with our updated guidance, we continue to manage through changing environments to deliver solid results. Specific changes to our guidance include the following. The range for average earning assets moved up again slightly as we anticipate coming in between $28.7 billion to $29 billion. We adjusted the range on net interest margin for the full year to 3.43% to 3.47%. We decreased the provision expense range to $38 million to $43 million. Non-interest income increased to a range of $230 million to $235 million. Non-interest expense was reduced to between $667 million and $673 million. We adjusted our preferred dividend and unrestricted shares allocation to a range of $16 million to $17 million. Finally, we tightened our tax rate to a range of 23.5% to 24%. This adjusted guidance still aligns us with current consensus estimates. As I've said many times, we continue to be very focused and disciplined on producing high-quality earnings and are not interested in stretching to do a deal. Relative to 2020, we recognize that we are asset sensitive and we may get more cuts beyond the one projected for later this month. As you would expect, we will be very proactive managing our business to help mitigate some of the negative impact of NIM compression while continuing to grow our business for the long-term. Specifically, we believe that expense savings opportunities exist, capital management activities remain attractive and viable, and our growth from diverse markets provides some solid offsets. Historically, IBERIABANK has done quite well in challenging times. I would expect us to rise to the occasion once again next year. We feel good about the business. We remain passionate about building client relationships, delivering long-term shareholder value and investing in our communities. Once again, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their focus and hard work in continuing to execute our strategy and grow our franchise. At this time, let's open the lines for questions. Rocco? Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And today's first question comes from Catherine Mealor of KBW. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Catherine. I wanted to start with the margin. If you look at your guidance for fourth quarter and we run that forward just to the fourth quarter then, from my math, it looks like the high end of the range is getting the margin around 3.25% for the next quarter. So one, wanted to make sure that we're kind of thinking about that correctly, and then secondly, is there anything kind of onetime or in terms of recoveries or deposit costs that are pushing the fourth quarter margin low, too low that we may see some recovery from that as we look to 2020? Yeah. Anthony's got this one. Anthony? Okay. Thanks. Yeah, so Catherine, relative to the guide, yes, the 3.25% would be implied by guide that we've got out there. Couple of things just to remember, right, so we did add an October cut. Remember that we are asset sensitive. We've got, from a repricing perspective, we've got about 50% of our loans are going to reprice and I'll call it 100% deposit beta with that October move that we're projecting. And then like we talked about last quarter, there's a little bit of a lag relative to seeing the deposits come back and move. So I think when you look at the fourth quarter, right, we've got an additional cut, right. So three cuts in a row from the Fed that we're still trying to catch-up from seeing deposits roll over. At the same time, we're projecting a little bit less on recoveries in the fourth quarter. We talked about $20 million for the year. We're at $17.7 million, so we haven't adjusted that. Again, recoveries are hard for us to kind of gauge, but we went ahead and brought that down just to be safe on the guide. I think, as we sit here and look at the fourth quarter, we have started to see our deposits roll over, which is very good. I think the pace of that is going to accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter into 2020. And then naturally, we're seeing some nice offsets from the lower rate environment, and that's coming through on our fee businesses. So I think as we look at it, we feel actually like not too bad relative to where we were. The only thing that's really different for us is, we've got an extra cut that we've got to deal with now as opposed to next year. So, I think all in all, we feel pretty good about where we are. Okay. I mean if we look at consensus for 2020, on average the margin's at 3.38% versus that fourth quarter 3.25%, and now I know everyone has different assumptions for what rates are going to do next year, so it's hard to make sense of it. But I mean, if that 3.25% implies that there's fairly significant downside to consensus estimates in 2020 as we think about the margin, is that a fair way to think about this new money? Yeah, look, I think that there's a host of different estimates out there relative to cuts. I mean we've got some people talking about five more cuts. We've got some people talking about one more cut. I think what I would tell you relative to the 2020 guidance is that we feel pretty good about we're going to see the October cut. I think right now, you've got a possibility of another cut sometime, I'll call it late into the first quarter, mid-year-ish next year. I think the thing that might be missing from the guidance would be, yeah, the margin's going to come down, but what you don't really see, I think embedded in the guidance, would be the strength of the fee businesses that we should get from lower interest rate environment. Certainly, we're going to have a really good loan-to-deposit growth given that we think credit will be fairly stable as we move through next year. I think that inflection on deposit cost and we talked about that repricing is going to accelerate into next year, which will help the margin a little bit. We do have the ability to reduce expenses. I'll just point out that we've reduced our expense – midpoint of the expense guide four quarters in a row. So although we're not out telegraphing big expense moves, we're very active and you should expect that to continue. And then look there's viable and attractive capital market restack options that are viable and look attractive and can meaningfully improve EPS next year. So I think as we think about our business, we feel real good about where we're positioned today against. We recognize we are asset sensitive but we've got a lot of other good things working our way. And as Daryl mentioned, we've actually done quite well historically during challenging times. So I think we kind of look at it more as glass more than half full versus over half empty here. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, Catherine I would add to that. Look, we can't predict what the rate environment is going to look like. Frankly, as we look at our markets and our clients, they're all doing pretty well which correlates over to we've got excellent loan growth, excellent deposit growth. So our clients are doing well. We've got great credit. And our fee businesses given the rate environment are doing extremely well. So we've always tried to answer the challenge and we always try to get ahead of the challenge. And historically we've executed multiple expense initiatives, but as Anthony said, we rarely telegraph those until we've already executed them. So we're going to try to get ahead of this rate environment and certainly do the best we can to make it work for us. That's great. That puts it in perspective for sure. Maybe if I could just one other follow-up on the margin just to stay on the topic is the – on cash versus reported margin, as we think about accretable yield for next year, is there anything that we should be thinking about for that? We've seen about $13 million kind of on average non-cash accretion over the past couple of quarters. Does that change significantly going into next year post-CECL or kind of how should we think about that in a post-CECL world? So a couple of thoughts for you, Catherine. One is obviously, we've got recovery income that's embedded somewhat in that line and that's really hard for us to kind of predict. We've talked about that, but the base level of accretion on the portfolio is fairly constant. It'll roll down – I mean the actual income level will roll down as the portfolio kind of burns off, but the incremental accretion from a yield perspective on the base level is fairly consistent. CECL, not really expected to have an impact on that accretion level. Got it. That's helpful. And again, we don't have a cliff or anything associated with that because most of the assets we picked up were more mortgage driven instruments with a very long life. That's right. Okay. Thanks for that clarity. Right, thank you, I'll hop out. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Ebrahim. I guess just a question to some of the things that you mentioned to Catherine's question around expenses and the focus there. Like understanding all the macro uncertainties, Daryl, can you talk about just your expectation to getting positive operating leverage as we think about next year? Like you guys have done a great job cutting expenses, improving efficiency over the last year or two, would love to get your thoughts in terms of if you think that is achievable next year or could we see the efficiency ratio take higher in 2020? Look we're going to – we're going to manage what we can. I think Anthony was pretty straightforward. We've lowered our expense guide four quarters in a row. My comment is we've done multiple expense initiatives over the last several years. But we rarely telegraph those until we've executed them for a lot of reasons. So we're going to work pretty hard at that. Yeah, Ebrahim, the only thing I would add is next year given kind of low rates, we are expecting to see some significant strength from the fee businesses and that could just, given the nature of this business,  can be (00:20:05) very people driven could put some slight upward pressure on the efficiency ratio. Again, as Darryl mentioned, we're going to be working very hard on the rest of the expense base. So we'll see if we can offset it. I'll just point out though that, we are going to see higher levels of commissions and some stuff next year. Got it. And just, in terms of following up on CECL, it's a pretty meaningful jump on average we've seen banks talk about 30% to 40% increase to their bases of – on CECL adoption. I was just wondering, Anthony, if you can talk about any particular characteristics within your loan book which is pushing it higher and how that influences everything about provisioning for incremental growth going forward? Yeah, so I'll point out that I think the biggest thing driving the percentage increase is the fact that we've got a large acquired portfolio that has very little reserve coverage on it today just by the, I guess by the way the accounting is prescribed in the current methodology. Obviously, we picked up some level of longer lived assets from the mortgage portfolios that came or the resi books that came with the recent acquisitions. And so given the longer life of those portfolios as well as the kind of that small residual HELOC portfolio naturally pushes the average life of the portfolio a little longer. And so those would be the primary two or three drivers that are making up the bulk of the increase. Again, not that we expect credit to be different, just the function of the life of the portfolio. So, would the run-off of the acquired book be incrementally positive as we think about next year or two and how is it placed through the CECL map? I'm sorry. Can you give me that one more time? Yeah, would the run-off of the accretive – sort of the acquired sort of portfolio be incrementally positive to just provisioning going forward and some of those balances run-off or? Yeah, look, I'll tell you that I don't know relative to the allowance perspective that the portfolio running off is going to make a big deal as we talk about just provision. I think as we move into next year I think what you're going to see us talk about is we have a portfolio, I think the concept for us of legacy and acquired will kind of go away because the accounting is largely indifferent at that point. I don't expect to see a significant increase in provision levels as we move forward from the new adoption. It might be a couple million but not going to be material. And so, I hope that that helps you with that Ebrahim. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah. And our next question today comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question on the mortgage business, so the MBA's forecast obviously project a decline in volumes next year, but I know you guys are kind of in the midst of retooling your mortgage business. How should we think about the ability to continue to drive profitability in that business and to actually increase revenue next year? Thanks. Michael, I'm going to turn this one over to Fernando, but I'll start by saying we feel very good about the progress we've made in mortgage like that team has done a great job for us. Fernando? I think there are two components to the question. One, when we look at the pipeline that we have this year, I mean as of this quarter compared to last year, we are looking at a pipeline that is more than 60% higher. And that make us feel good about the production in the coming quarters. And at the same time, we are combining  that production with fairly new MLOs (00:23:50) in the different markets that we are present and working on efficiencies. We've been working in the last couple of years on reducing the fixed cost over the total amount of cost of the mortgage business. And to give you some idea of the evolution, in 2017, we had 65% of the total cost was fixed and now that number is 56%. And we keep working on efficiencies, and standardizing their process improvement to combine better revenue with a more variable structure of the cost basis of the business. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up question. You guys highlighted energy growth this quarter is one of the drivers of overall loan growth. I know there's been some consternation at least among investors around energy. Can you just talk about how you feel about the size of the portfolio? What you're growing at this point and if we should – if there's any worries out there for you guys? Thanks. Yeah, Michael, we feel good about our energy portfolio. Jeff, you want to talk that one some. Sure, I'll be happy to. We have continued to get good growth out of that portfolio since we really reentered the market, Michael. I think you know that 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been good. You were at 5.9% in terms of the overall portfolio right now. Frankly, that's not terribly different than where we were at 4.8% in 2015. So, we're comfortable with our level of exposure. I should mention to you and this is important to me. Last week, I had the pleasure of sitting down and doing a portfolio review and we had our Chief Credit Officer and our Chief Risk Officer. And I think I can report to you today that we feel very, very good about our portfolio. And frankly during that portfolio review, we did not discover any new information. As you know, we have a balanced portfolio largely E&P, 62% of our portfolio and midstream 33%. We haven't made an oil field service loan in five years. That's down probably from about 35% to 5% today. And we feel good about our mix. I should probably also mention to you that 66% of our portfolio is PE-backed and we have not seen people back away from the market and supporting their investments. I will also go so far as to say because I've seen several other people make comments on it. The question comes up about the recent SNC exam that went on nationally. We saw no material impact to our portfolio as a result of that. So, net-net, we feel good. We do continue to see unfortunately probably some misinformation in the markets. From time to time, people cite statistics. I saw one the other day where we were mentioned to have a $20 million exposure and a credit that fully paid off for us 18 months ago. We don't have – we have a policy of not commenting on specific credits, but I would say that before people calculate and crank that into their assumptions, they ought to look more closely. If I could add, it's Michael, just energy has certainly been an important contributor to our company and we feel very comfortable with that part of the portfolio. I would emphasize that we do have a diversified growth story as a company and we see loan growth coming from multiple markets, multiple industries. We've talked last time about our equipment finance business being a strong contributor to the growth of the company that continues if you looked at the numbers for the quarter, we saw real estate loans decline. We saw C&I increase that was a conscious effort or is a conscious effort on the part of the company to diversify the loan portfolio. And we've seen runoff in our home equity business which we've more than offset and that runoff is just tied to people refinancing into the mortgage business which helps Fernando's part of the company out as well. So we feel like we have a very defined growth story and feel very comfortable with our ability to garner clients. So layering all that together Michael, fair to say that mid-single-digit loan growth for next year is a good starting point. Yeah, I would say so. One of the things that I would emphasize and I did in my last comment, we've had a lot of success lately with recruiting. I mean that's something we consciously always are doing, but of late, we've seen an increase in activity from larger institutions. And with that recruiting, we've taken up some very talented people who've got access to some large client portfolios. That has some very significant upside for us in all of our markets. So start with the single-digit number that you mentioned and the potential is higher. Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Casey. Wanted to follow up on the deposit costs. It does sound like they're rolling over here or starting to roll over here in the third quarter. But it did – I mean it seemed like last quarter, you guys were talking pretty optimistically about deposit costs. So I was just wondering could you give us some color as to what surprised you, was it competitive pressures? And then if we could get spot rates for the money market accounts and CDs specifically at September 30th, just to give as a gauge as to how things are entering the fourth quarter here. Casey, a couple things, I think last quarter we talked about that we thought we'd see deposit rates roll in 60 to 90 days, and that we were thinking deposit rates would kind of plateau during the quarter. So I think what we actually talked about last quarter is actually what happened this quarter. It's a little bit hard to give you spot rate, deposit rates, because we do price deposits differently in every market and deposits are – deposit rates are very fluid, right. So we talked last quarter about we were going to be a fast follower on deposit rates. We've maintained to that. And so what I can tell you is deposit rates are moving down, and we're adjusting rates fairly constantly across the 32 different markets at different paces. I'll give you just as a couple of quick examples, right. If we look at October month-to-date, right, CDs are down 25 basis points below the third quarter origination yield. So just in the first couple of two weeks or so in October, we're down just 25 basis points within the CD book, right. Just as an example of how fluid that is. So a little bit hard to give you a rate. I can just tell you that we are just following the market closely, and we expect that those deposit – that deposit repricing will accelerate. And to be honest with you, the more the Fed moves, and the more often they move and the more its headline news, the more cover it gets for us to move rates. So I think we'll see some pretty good momentum heading into the fourth quarter, and then we'll always be in a little bit of a catch-up mode. Just recognize, if we get two, three, four cuts in a row, it's going to take us a little bit to catch up. But we will get some upside once we get to the final end of those cuts. And Casey, we had excellent deposit growth in the quarter, and we're going into the fourth quarter, which is typically our best deposit growth quarter. Right. Yeah, and I wanted to follow up on that as well. But also, yeah, and when you talk about that, is it – are you expecting a better mix seasonally of more DDAs than CDs? Yes, but it's also a quarter where we see a lot of public funds come in as well. Got you. Okay. And then just lastly on CECL, just so I'm thinking about the – I'm trying to quantify the dollar impact. So that 1% to 1.2% ACL is that – what is that – what's the comparative ratio today? Is it just taking the loan loss allowance of 1.46% and then the reserve for unfunded, which would – which is about 69 basis points, is that the right way, is that the like-on-like number? Yes, that's correct. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, hey, Casey, one thing, remember on the capital impact to that, remember that that onetime adjustment is phased-in over a couple of years, right. So as we think about capital impact from that, it really is pretty de minimis just because of the way it gets phased-in over a couple of years, so will not have an impact on our ability to continue to buy shares as we head into next year. Okay. So – I mean what kind of TCE ratio impact do you see as of March 31st? Hold on. We'll come back to you at the end of the call on that one. Great. Thank you. Today's next question comes from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I want to go back to the loan growth discussion and can you just talk about the competition levels in your core markets? It seems like some of your bank peers have been growing their loan a little bit slower and they're highlighting irrational pricing especially from some of the non-banks, I'm curious what you're seeing in some of your core markets around loan growth? Michael? Yeah, I mean clearly, we've been able to provide loan growth. Our credit quality is staying strong, so we're not dipping in terms of quality and that's traditionally because we put connected people or the right people in front of the right clients. Yes, it is a more competitive environment. Yes, the banks are more aggressive on structure and pricing has come in, but our view is on the long-term, therefore, banking the right clients or banking them on a relationship basis which is our focus, we're going to pick up deposits, treasury management, wealth, that rounded our relationship is going to provide the return we're looking for. So we think we're messaging to our people. Yes, loans more aggressive, it's reality, but this is the time to get clients in our mind. And if we get the full relationship, that's the best approach to use in terms of overall profitability. And Michael, I guess sticking with the pricing discussion, is there any product or loan type that seems to be more aggressive in your marketplaces than others? No, I wouldn't differentiate. I mean I think it's generally across the board. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as far as the fees, I think you highlighted in the discussion over $3 million gain on the sale of non-mortgage loans, any more color you can provide on this and will such sales continue? I can give you some color. They were loans that had come to us through acquisition, didn't fit in with the portfolio that we had. It's not something that we traditionally have done. It just made sense to take advantage of frankly the market right now to sell them. Yeah, so Matt, we've held things in the past, whether it was the reverse mortgage product that we had, those loans actually went out at – are on the books, were at lower yields than stuff we could originate today. And so, just made sense to go ahead and let those go, sell those, take the gain, get us some capacity for loan growth. I will say it did truncate our loan growth numbers for the quarter and so we'd had really stout loan growth, have we not gone ahead and done that, but we'll do that from time to time where it makes sense from a balance sheet perspective. And also just I'll link it back to the methodology I just described in terms of how we look at clients, they were transactional. There was absolutely nothing more we could do with a particular client in terms of again improving profitability and getting the returns you're looking for, so it just was a logical outcome. Okay. And so, in terms of forecasting, it sounds like you don't think that should be in the run rate per se, but it could happen occasionally again over the next few quarters, is that fair? Yes. Yeah, that's fair. Perfect. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Follow-up question on the energy loan bucket. Jeff, what do you think you guys are doing different from your energy lender peers in this category? We've seen charge-offs go up in that bucket for almost everybody that's doing this lending as capital markets have tightened? Jenny, this is Daryl. I'll start and I'll let Jeff take over because I think the first part of your question is what's different about us from a credit perspective than maybe others. And it really goes to the point Jeff made relative to a credit paying off 18 months ago. We have a very active portfolio management process in the company and we try to get way out ahead of issues from a credit perspective. And that's whether it's energy or some other part of the C&I book or the CRE book. We're always trying to be out in front from a portfolio management perspective and dealing with issues that we think are going to be problems down the road. Jeff? Yeah, Jennifer, I think one of the things I would add is, it's hard to quantify the value of having a team of people that have been together for a number of years. The person who actually runs this for us over in Houston has been with us for 10 years. And so, we looked back obviously through the last cycle and had to make decisions about how do we proceed with a business that has been a good business for us, and by the way generates a lot of ancillary positives in the form of treasury management and PCard and deposits. But we've been very, very careful and diligent in building this. We have as I mentioned in the earlier question, it's not the accident that we have a lot of PE-backed companies. So, trying to maintain our liquidity numbers and leverage numbers and staying on top of that, as Daryl said a minute ago, counseling out where you need to do, do so. We've been – we'll stay on top of that. I will say this, Jennifer, we're seeing, as you know, a lot of people will look at the price of oil and say, well, oil's $54, everything is fine. But natural gas prices have been soft and they were soft through this summer and that has impacted natural gas credits. As we go to the redetermination period, we'll probably see, we'll see certainly, some borrowing base is reaffirmed, but we'll see reductions on some of the natural gas side. So, I think that you've got to watch that side right now. People are speculating about how much risk migration might occur in here over the course of the year, but I think we're very comfortable, and as I said a minute ago, we went through that portfolio review recently and nothing new whatsoever in looking at over 90% of our portfolio. And if I could add, this maybe ties into Matt's question, that's an extremely profitable business for us. The reserve base lending space has been good for us throughout the cycle and continues to be our top returning business. There's obviously the risk component Jeff referred to, but we believe we can manage that risk and get an outsized return from that space based on the knowledge base we have as a company. Second question, just curious, environment's gotten tougher year over year for everybody with lower rates. Daryl, what's IBERIA's interest in acquisitions right now and where do you see the M&A environment going over the next several quarters? Jenny, there was a lot of talk early in the year, but not a lot of action. And really I think the interest rate challenges are out there for everyone. And from our perspective, we're very focused on our earnings and kind of meeting that challenge. We like our franchise and we like the opportunities that we have with this franchise. As I've said earlier in our markets and for our clients, the economy feels pretty good for them. And so we think we have plenty of opportunities from a loan and deposit growth perspective with the existing franchise. Thanks a lot. And our next question today comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. And Daryl and team, I want to ask about the digital bank and kind of the digital product offerings for commercial customers. How much more is needed there? How much more have you done? I'm just curious if this is something that gets a lot of priority or is less. We'll go back to Anthony because Anthony has got business transformation for us and we're spending a lot of time thinking about those issues. Anthony? Yeah, Chris, we actually recognize that the middle market commercial space is really what drives the engine for IBERIABANK. And so along with that, we have recognized that the appropriate technology is going to be wrapped around that. So we started, call it two, three years ago really to make a big push to enhance. We talked a lot about treasury management in terms of deeper offering, better offering and that includes being able to do all that through electronic means. We then followed up to really build out, I'll call it, our loan origination system. That project continues to evolve. We think that's going to be very impactful for us in a number of ways on the cost side, speed of the customers, et cetera. And so it's not something that I'd say that we would declare victory on, but I think we feel really good. We've got a defined focus on where we're trying to get to recognize and that if we wrap excellent technology around our excellent lenders, we're going to get excellent results. And so that's what our focus is. If I could add I mean from a treasury management perspective, we compete with larger institutions on a constant basis and we win. So we think we can go toe to toe based upon very good products so. Great, Byrd. Thanks guys. And that's in the treasury piece is what I was going to ask, so thank you Michael for following up. That's great guys. Thank you for the background here. Thank you. One quick thing, Casey, following back up on the TCE impact, I think if you look at the range relative to the March 31 to about 25 basis points if you just kind of straddle the range is what we think we'll see impact to the TCE relative to the CECL adoption. . All right. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Daryl Byrd for any closing remarks. Rocco, thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and your confidence in our company. Everybody have a great day and a great weekend. Thank you. And thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

         "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin. Hey, thanks so much, Brad, and Happy Friday, everybody. We're really pleased to have you all join us. First up this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our results and our outlook, and then we will reference the earnings presentation, which you can find at investor.citizensbank.com. Then we'll be happy to take questions. In the room with us today are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking and they will be able to provide some additional color. So now, for some quick housekeeping, our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the factors that may cause our result to differ materially from the expectations on page 2 of the presentation and in our 2018 Form 10-K. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the presentation and to utilize the information about these measures and the reconciliation to GAAP in the appendix. And with that, Bruce, it's all yours. All right. Thanks Ellen and good morning everyone, thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter. In spite of interest rate yield curve headwinds, we grew our revenue 5% versus a year ago and 1% versus last quarter. Our earnings per share was up 5% versus a year ago, and up 2% sequentially. The keys to these results were strong performance in our mortgage business, continued good expense discipline and robust capital return. We progressed well on our efforts around TOP 6 and on some of the strategic investment initiatives that we outlined last quarter. We continue to actively manage the balance sheet through our BSO program, and we've maintained a loan-to-deposit ratio of around 94%. We managed deposit costs down aggressively in the quarter, with interest-bearing deposit costs down 6 basis points versus last quarter, and we expect deposit betas to tick up as we see further rate cuts. Our credit metrics remain strong overall and both Consumer and Commercial are in really good shape. Our view is that the economy is holding up reasonably well, though growth has slowed somewhat versus a year ago. While we don't see a recession on the horizon anytime soon, we are being duly cautious in selective areas on new loan originations. So overall, I'd say, we've executed well year-to-date and we feel we are positioned to close out the year with a good fourth quarter. Our formula for 2020 will remain consistent, namely, grow our balance sheet prudently, deftly manage our NIM, continue to invest in our fee businesses and reap the returns, carefully manage the expense base by finding fresh efficiencies and then self-funding new initiatives, stay disciplined on credit and actively manage our capital base. We celebrated an important milestone during the quarter, the fifth anniversary of our IPO on September 24. It's been quite a journey, we've made much progress in building a great bank and we are now delivering better and better for customers, colleagues, communities, shareholders, and regulators. We know there is more work to do and we are energized by the challenge. I'm confident that our track record of strong and disciplined execution will continue and will differentiate us from our peers. And there's no reason the next five years can't be even better than the last five. With that, let me stop and turn it over to our CFO, John Woods. Great. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report a strong quarter with record fee income, good expense discipline, and continued execution against our strategic initiatives. Let me kick off by covering the important highlights of our underlying results on page 4. On a year-to-date basis, our EPS is up 11% and for the quarter, we delivered EPS growth of 5% year-over-year with PPNR up 2%. This reflects relatively stable net interest income, as 3% loan growth helped offset the impact of a decline in net interest margin to 3.12%, given rates and yield curve. We delivered record fee income of nearly $500 million, up 19% year-over-year, illustrating the diversity of our business model. Commercial and Consumer loan growth were each up 3% year-over-year, as we seek attractive areas to deploy our capital and grow our customer base. Strong deposit growth was paced by continuing momentum in Citizens Access, which grew to $5.6 billion by quarter end. Our spot LDR was 94.5%, providing us with funding flexibility, as we head into the end of the year. Given the environment, we remain highly focused on expense discipline and continue to execute extremely well on our TOP program. We now expect to realize a pre-tax run-rate benefit for our TOP 5 program in the range of $105 million to $115 million by the end of the year. This is a $10 million increase over our prior estimate. Overall credit quality remained strong, with a stable nonperforming loan ratio of 67 basis points and an allowance to loans ratio of 107 basis points. On an underlying basis, the effective tax rate was 22.3%, as the reported rate of 20.5% includes a $10 million tax benefit associated with an operational restructure. We delivered underlying ROTCE of 12.6% and tangible book value per share was up 14% year-over-year to $31.48. This quarter, there was some noise in several line items due to an aircraft lease restructuring in our non-core portfolio. This was triggered by a client merger and reflects our continuing efforts to accelerate the rundown of the non-core lease portfolio. This reduced PPNR by about $3 million, with an increase in expense of $10 million and a $7 million increase in fees. Charge-offs and provision were $5 million higher due to this transaction. Before the impact of this restructuring, we delivered positive operating leverage of 30 basis points on a linked quarter basis and efficiency ratio of 57.8%. On page 6, net interest income was relatively stable year-over-year despite the impact of a challenging yield-curve environment. Loan growth of 3% helped largely offsetting the impact of a 10-basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.12%, given the rate backdrop. Contributing to the decline in NIM was a 3 basis point impact year-over-year from higher premium amortization tied to significantly lower long-term rates. This was partially offset by the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields, given continued mix shift towards better returning assets and modestly higher short-term rates. On a linked quarter basis, the margin decreased 9 basis points, including a 3 basis point impact from premium amortization. On a positive note, we managed deposits well with a 6 basis point decrease in interest-bearing deposit costs. Given the challenging rate environment, we have continued to actively manage our asset sensitivity, which came in at 2.7% to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates versus 2.9% in the prior quarter. Year-over-year, our asset sensitivity has come down. This was driven by the addition of approximately $7 billion of net receive fix swaps over the past four quarters, including a net $2 billion forward-starting position we added this quarter, as well as evolving expectations for balance sheet mix. The cumulative effect of our hedging activities over the last year, plus our balance sheet mix changes had the effect of shifting our sensitivity to the long-end of the curve, with about 20% to 25% of our exposure now tied to 6 months and shorter. Our current outlook is for an additional rate cut in October. However, we expect to see a lower level of NIM compression in the fourth quarter reflecting further declines in interest-bearing deposit costs, broadly stable premium amortization and the benefit of our hedges. These factors, along with an expected resumption of loan growth, should help support net interest income in the fourth quarter. Moving to fees on slide 7, as I mentioned, our fee-based businesses delivered record results this quarter with fee income hitting 30% of revenue. Noninterest income was up 7% on a linked-quarter basis and up 19% year-over-year, driven by strong results in mortgage banking, card fees, and foreign exchange and interest rate products. Service charges and fees were up $2 million or 2% linked quarter, reflecting seasonality, and card fees were up 5% sequentially, driven by seasonally higher volumes. Our acquisition of Franklin is playing out as we hoped and serves as a nice hedge against the backdrop of lower rates. Mortgage banking fees were up $55 million as the origination business led the way with production revenue up $31 million on higher volumes and improved gain-on-sale margins. Overall, mortgage services revenue increased $24 million, given favorable MSR hedging results and our larger servicing portfolio. Capital markets fees came in at $39 million this quarter which represents the lowest level since the first quarter of 2018, in the face of overall market weakness. Even so, we improved our market share and positioning. Syndication fees were down linked quarter reflecting the impact of a significant slowing in middle market activity and seasonality, while bond underwriting fees were higher as fixed income markets picked up later in the quarter. We are entering the fourth quarter with a strong overall capital markets pipeline, which includes the impact of several deals that were pushed out from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Wealth fees were 6% lower linked quarter from record second quarter levels, as investment sales were impacted by volatile market conditions. In FX and interest rate products, we executed exceptionally well despite challenging conditions, delivering near record level fees in line with second quarter in what is typically a seasonally slower quarter. We are pleased with the progress we've made diversifying our fee revenue by broadening capabilities, executing well on strategic initiatives and integrating key acquisitions to build scale in mortgage, expand our M&A business and enhance our wealth capabilities. And as we look forward, the investments we have been making across the platform over the past five years should continue to gain traction, as we seek to do more for our customers and be their trusted advisor. Turning to page 8. Underlying noninterest expense was up $10 million linked quarter, reflecting the impact of the lease transaction. Excluding this impact, expenses were flat illustrating our strong commitment to expense discipline as we continue to deliver efficiencies from our TOP programs. We continue to recycle cost savings from TOP into revenue generating opportunities. Salaries and employee benefits remained relatively stable, and equipment and software expense was up 3% given our ongoing technology efforts. Compared to the prior year, underlying noninterest expenses before the impact of acquisitions and the lease restructuring was up 3%, as we efficiently managed our costs while investing for growth. Let's move on to page 9 and discuss the balance sheet. Average loans were relatively stable linked quarter largely reflecting the impact of the second quarter loan sales as well as relatively higher repayments and lower line utilization in commercial. Year-over-year, average loans were up 3%, driven by growth in both Commercial and retail with some modest headwinds from asset dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of the loan sales in the first half, loan growth was 4% year-over-year. Commercial loans were up 4% year-over-year with strength in C&I, and were down slightly linked quarter due to relatively high repayments and the impact of lower line utilization, as well as planned reductions in Commercial leases. On the retail side, loans were up 3% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter given growth in mortgage, education refinance, and our merchant finance partnerships. Regarding the lease restructuring this quarter, I should mention that we have done a nice job running down the non-core leasing portfolio and the total non-core book which are both down about 30% year-on-year, while the overall credit quality of the book continues to improve. Overall, period-end loans were up 1% linked quarter, providing momentum for fourth quarter loan growth. Moving to page 10, we saw nice deposit growth of 1% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year. We continued to benefit from our Citizens Access digital platform, which has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit levels and costs. At the end of the quarter, we reached $5.6 billion in Citizens Access deposits. Given the rate environment we have been aggressively executing our deposit playbook to manage down our deposit costs across all channels, reducing CD rates, retail money market promo rates and taking down the savings rate in our direct bank. We've also been reducing rates for some Commercial clients where it makes sense. As a result, our total deposit costs were well controlled, down 5 basis points linked quarter, a nice improvement from the 3 basis point increase last quarter. Interest-bearing deposits were down 6 basis points linked quarter. Next, let's move to page 11 and cover credit, which continues to look quite good overall. This reflects an improving risk profile in retail and a relatively stable risk profile at favorable levels in Commercial. Net charge-offs came in at 38 basis points in the quarter, up modestly from the relatively low second quarter levels. Net charge-offs were up $27 million year-over-year with a $16 million increase in Commercial, largely driven by a small number of uncorrelated losses, as the broader portfolio risk profile remained relatively stable. Retail net charge-offs increased $8 million reflecting expected seasoning in our growth portfolios. Provision for credit losses of $101 million was up from prior quarter and prior year levels reflecting a higher charge-offs. The nonperforming loan ratio of 67 basis points was relatively stable linked quarter and improved 6 basis points year-over-year. Nonperforming loans decreased 5% year-over-year, driven by improvements in retail. On a linked quarter basis, nonperforming loans increased 3%, driven by an increase in Commercial primarily tied to a small number of loans, while we saw improvements in retail driven by home equity and education. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remained relatively stable, ending the quarter at 107 basis points. The NPL coverage ratio was also stable linked quarter at 159 basis points. On page 12, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions, ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.3% which compares well with peers and gives us excellent financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares of common stock and including dividends, we returned $662 million to shareholders, up 25% year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%. And our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio remains on track. Let's move to page 13 and discuss the CECL. We expect that the day-1 impact for CECL on a pro forma basis will be about a 30% to 35% increase in the existing reserve which was about $1.3 million (sic) [$1.3 billion] (00:16:35) at the end of the quarter. From a capital perspective, this represents about 22 to 25 basis points of CET1 on a fully-phased-in basis, or approximately 5 to 6 basis points in year one. This range considers the current economic outlook and mix and credit characteristics of the portfolio. In addition a key factor is the impact the longer-duration loans such as education, home equity, auto and residential mortgages that tend to attract a higher level of reserve. At the same time, the Commercial portfolio is generally shorter duration and so is expected to require less reserves than it does today. Ultimately, the impact of the initial impact will reflect both the portfolio mix and the macroeconomic outlook when we get to the end of the year. On page 14, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our bank. First, we ranked number four on the 2019 J.D. Power U.S. Home Mortgage Satisfaction survey. Since last year we moved up six positions in that survey, which is a real testament to the hard work our mortgage colleagues have done to integrate Franklin American while relentlessly focusing on our customers. We are also very excited to announce that we've just entered into a new Consumer Banking partnership with an iconic technology company to be announced shortly. We will provide more details around the launch of this program which is later this quarter, but this is another great example of our commitment to innovation and strong focus on the customer experience. In Commercial, we are really progressing well with the client migration to accessOPTIMA, our best-in-class cash management platform. About half of our clients are on the platform and we expect the transition to be complete by the end of the year. And in addition to TOP 5 which I mentioned earlier, substantial work is underway on our TOP 6 program which is targeting the pre-tax run rate benefit of about $300 million to $325 million by the end of 2021. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is on page 15 and it reflects continued good positioning of both our top and bottom line results. Our current view is that we expect an additional rate cut in October, and as a result, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter, as loan growth should offset further, but less net NIM contraction due to rates. Our outlook for loan growth reflects stronger period-end trends, coupled with healthy pipelines driven by our geographic, product, and client-focused expansion strategies. Also, we expect a moderation of third quarter Commercial pay down and utilization trends, as well as continued growth in mortgage, student and other retail. We are expecting noninterest income to be down modestly from the record levels last quarter. Strength in capital markets revenues should largely offset a decline from record mortgage fees. Given our continued focus on expense discipline, we expect noninterest expense to be flat to slightly down. Additionally, we expect provision expense to increase by about $10 million. And finally, we expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of approximately 10.1%. To sum up on page 17, our results this quarter d emonstrate our continuing strong performance, as we execute against our strategic initiatives, grow customers and revenues, carefully manage our expense base, deploy new technologies and improve how we run the bank. Now let me turn it back to Bruce. Okay. Thanks, John. Operator – Brad, let's open it up for some Q&A. Thanks.  And we go to line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. First of all, great job on reducing your interest-bearing deposit costs this quarter. We've heard from other banks the deposit competition is still really aggressive and, Bruce, I know you mentioned that you expect your deposit betas to increase next quarter. Did that imply that some of that deposit competition might be easing? Do you want to take this? Yeah. Yeah, I'll go ahead and start off. Again, I mean, I think – I think it's a number of factors. I mean when you have a rate cut like we had in September, it's just a natural operational lag, if you will, and we talked in previous calls that there's a deposit lag that maybe, call it, three to six months. And so, as we get further away from that September cut, the impact of that cut gets pushed through operationally and we're going to see deposit betas increase from 3Q into 4Q and therefore we expect interest-bearing deposit costs to actually decline by a larger amount than they did this quarter. Okay, great. And then just my second question is in terms of your energy exposure, we had three other banks that I cover announced higher energy charge-offs this quarter, and I know you guys didn't mention it at all which is certainly a positive. But can you just address what you're seeing from a credit perspective in your energy portfolio? Yeah. Ken, it's Don. I'll talk about that for a second. We've actually been working through our energy exposure for a little over a year now. Our NPLs are way down – they're down from about 25% of our total NPLs to 9%. So, we've restructured and worked through a lot of them. Our overall portfolio is down. And I think one of the things that we in our portfolio, I don't know what other banks have is very low exposure to Oilfield Services and that's where a lot of the distress, it looks like it's happening in the oil sector. So, we have good RBL structures and good Midstream structures and we're pretty comfortable, we don't see any incremental distress in the portfolio of any significance. All right. Great. Thank you. And we can move to the next question with John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Morning. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color on the Commercial credit front. I know your Commercial nonperformers were up 25% linked quarter, and you'd noted in the release that a small number of uncorrelated credits. So, just wanted to see if you can give us a little more detail on the industry, on maybe the sizes and the types of loans as well. Thanks. You want to go again Don? Yeah. I'll take that one. So, we did have a couple charge-offs in the quarter, one in the real estate division which is a regional mall, where we took a small charge-off to basically position ourselves to hopefully exit out that credit with the sale or restructuring in the near future. Our nonperformer move was really one credit, which is in the automotive-linked sector which we've been working through. It's well reserved. We don't think there is a significant charge-off there when we took it nonperformer, not nonperforming. It's a restructuring deal that we did about a year ago. There's a significant amount of junior capital below us now, we feel okay about the credit, and we thought it was prudent to take it into nonperformer given the cash flow dynamics of the company. Yeah. And I would add to what Don mentioned on that first credit, we're close to having that one resolved, which would allow NPAs to fall back down in Q4. And I think more generally, as I think John said, we feel good about the general trends in the portfolio, where we feel like we're identifying any issues early, we're aggressively addressing them, we're trying to move them off the portfolio to the extent we think there's future risk, so we're trying to move through anything in the portfolio where we think we have any significant loss factored into it. Yeah. Be proactive, good motto. Okay. Got it, got it. And then, Bruce, you indicated in your remarks that you're being cautious, prudently cautious in certain lending areas. What type of areas are they and what are you seeing that's making you get more cautious? Thanks. And I could throw that one to Don as well but I'll kick off here. But I think in general, there's some very competitive conditions in certain parts of the market, particularly middle market, we have a lot of non-bank competition there. And so we're competing where we want it hold up our relationships with our customers but we're not being aggressive to try to grow the book there and take on tough spread situations or tough term situations. So that's one. I think in certain areas like restaurants, we're certainly actually taking a posture towards reducing exposure, not adding exposure. And I think we're also being proactive there and we had some good momentum there. So, I'd just say it's around the edges, being disciplined and then seeking out areas of growth, our specialty verticals, we get some better spreads there. We're moving upmarket and competing effectively in mid-corporate. So, we think we'll see some growth there. And I think we did indicate that we will see a return to overall loan growth in Q4 and also in Commercial in Q4. So, our pipelines look quite good. We have seen, in Q3, elevated pay-downs, refinancings, lower line utilizations. So, even though we had a pretty strong quarter in terms of originations, we're fighting against that a little bit. But I think in Q4 we would expect to see less of that and we're continuing to see a nice pipeline. Don, you can add to that. Yeah. I'll just give you a little more of sense to that. I mean, a year ago, we were seeing paydowns drive about two-thirds of our originations. They were basically 1-to-1 this quarter. So, we really got hurt on new originations side from paydowns. I think there's a combination of things going on, I think, particularly in the middle market but in general we're seeing people deleverage in anticipation for uncertainty in the next years. So, they're not putting on incremental debt, there's not as many special dividend deals going on. There's not as many release of capital or buybacks that we're seeing in the core of our portfolio and that results in people to say we're going to take the utilization down. We are seeing some sense of that moderating, so that will help some of our loan growth going forward. As Bruce mentioned, some of the challenging portfolios our restaurant portfolio is down by about 50%  from where it was at the peak, but we're working that down, we're purposely working our leasing portfolio down and focusing on our core business. We've been working on multi-family real estate portfolio down. So, there is a lot of things that we're actually trying to address from a portfolio standpoint that is lagging the numbers on a net basis. And then, as you heard John talk about, we are actively involved and engaged in BSO and where we don't see adequate returns over the next two to three years of exposures we have, we'll consider moving them off the balance sheet. So, I think the new business feels good in areas that we've actually grown from a regional standpoint, from industry specialty standpoint, feels good and there's just a little bit of adjustment going on in terms of the overall book of business that we're trying to run. And just to echo what Bruce said, it is very competitive as people search for loan growth out there and want to stay disciplined on terms and conditions and pricing standpoint so we can maintain the terms of the book. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. And we go to next question in the queue come from Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe John, the first question, that's for you. I'm hoping if you can just put a little bit of a finer point on the fee guide for the fourth quarter and including some of the expected drivers. You mentioned capital markets in the pipeline there, but I guess I'm just curious given that you had pretty substantial MSR benefit, so sort of right off the bat it could be kind of a $25 million hole or up to $25 million hole. Just curious if you can talk a little bit more detail about the puts and takes, please. Yeah. Sure. I'll start off, and Bruce can add. I mean, I think the main point here is that as we mentioned that capital markets pipelines were quite strong. When we look at 3Q, that was a little bit more of a down quarter at $39 million. When we see the outlook in the 4Q, we have some deals push out of 3Q into 4Q. We had a very soft syndication quarter in 3Q, that looks to be firming up into the fourth quarter. M&A advisory, was an area that was flattish from 2Q to 3Q and we look to see that being meaningfully and significantly up in the fourth quarter. So, I'd say that when we – we tend to look at this in the early part of – July, we looked at our pipelines and how that would play out in 3Q. And now we're looking at the pipelines in early October here and it bodes well for a really nice rebound in capital markets. I should also mention that the service charges and card, which had a nice quarter in 3Q look to be up a bit further. And trust, I mean, I think there were some choppy market conditions that impacted trust and investment services, and I think that you'll see that our expectations are that that will improve going into the fourth quarter too. So, it's a couple of different levers that will all tend to have an impact into 4Q that would largely offset, as we said, the mortgage decline. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, broader question, just on rate sensitivity. You pulled back a little bit of the asset sensitivity this quarter as well. Wondering if you could just comment on whether there's sort of an end goal as to where you want the company's rate positioning to be. I mean obviously it's kind of tough given all the volatility on rates, but just what the broader long term thinking on rate sensitivity at this point? Yeah. And I think you've seen us take our asset sensitivity down over the last year, and I think that we've been prudent on that front. As you know a commercial bank has a natural asset-sensitive profile, and we used derivatives and other techniques to frankly dampen that profile. So, I think you would see us in a low-to-moderate asset-sensitive position over time, maybe converging towards neutral as we get towards the end of the easing cycle, if you will. And so, I think we're getting pretty close to a stable place. We do like – and have the view that we are at historically low long-term interest rate. We've changed our sensitivity from a majority exposure to the short end of the curve over the last year to now the majority of our exposure is to the long end of the curve. So, we have a view over time that long end of the curve will rise and we've executed our hedging activities with that in mind, and with a general sense that we should take some asset sensitivity off the table. And that's just on the net interest income line. And as you know, our mortgage provides a very nice overall revenue lift when and if rates were declined by a lot which is what happened in the third quarter. So, it's not just our derivatives and not just our sensitivity on net interest income, we look at how we try to preserve revenues overall and you saw the power of that diversification in the third quarter. Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And next in queue we've got Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. I wonder if just conceptually on net interest margin, once the Fed stops, I guess we're ought to decide when that is, but let's say it's mid-2020, the Fed stops easing. There's one school of thought that the banks could actually get a little bit of a bounce back at margin because of the deposit repricing lag you mentioned and that will catch up. And then, there's another worry that, well, the assets don't all reprice immediately and you're still going to have that kind of rollover of fixed rate assets to lower rates. I guess as you think about it not getting into the basis points of what the actual margin is going to be but just conceptually when the Fed stops, is your bias kind of a roughly stable margin or up on the deposit repricing or still some pressure on the asset yield to roll over? Yeah. I mean, I'd say a couple of things. I mean, I think you mentioned the deposit lag and I think that provides a tailwind once you get three to six months out, that's helpful. I think it matters where long rates are. As I mentioned earlier, if the Fed gets to the end of its easing cycle and we end up with a positive sloped yield curve, I think you could see some positive impacts in net interest margin over the, call it, two, three, four, five quarters out into 2020. And so, that's an important aspect. And I think that front-book back-book dynamic given the fact that we are roughly split 50/50 with a fixed loan portfolio and a floating loan portfolio. You're right that when rates fall we could see immediate impact on the floating part of the portfolio. But the fixed part provides that buffer. And if we – we can see some lift on the long end, we could see stabilizing to rising NIMs as you get three to six months beyond a Fed easing cycle. So, I think you'll see some stabilization here over the next quarter or two. And with those dynamics I mentioned, possibly even some lift when we get towards the end of 2020. The other thing I would add also is that if we get a little more loan growth, which we expect in the fourth quarter and to be able to sustain that in 2020, that facilitates more BSO actions in terms of kind of the loan side of the balance sheet. And so, hopefully that would kick in and then be accretive to our NIM as we go through 2020. Thank you. One small one, I don't mean to jump into the weeds, but on page 20 of the supplement, I had a few people ask about this negative $48 million in the provision for unfunded lending commitments. Can you just talk through, was that a release or was it more like a transfer because of loan drawdown. What drove that negative $48 million provision for unfunded lending? Yeah. Thanks for the question and looking at our supplement  (00:35:29). I didn't look at it. Someone else pointed it out to me. So, yeah, it is exactly as you mentioned. It was a – we had an unfunded loan where over time we've built the reserves on the unfunded part of the reserve in the ACL, if you will. But all of it is the provisioning of reserves happened while it was unfunded. And then once it is fully reserved, it's funded and then got transferred and needed to get transferred over to the ALLL. So overall, really the driver was a transfer of an unfunded, fully reserved loan that... It actually was a backup letter of credit... Yeah. Yeah, not... (00:36:09) Exactly. Yeah. It ultimately drew down and we moved it over. Yes. So. Yes, I think we released some reserve because they moved it to held for sale as well, so. That's right. Great. Thank you. Okay. Okay. And we go to next question in the queue that will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Fees were obviously strong this quarter and you gave some pretty good granularity in your thoughts on the fourth quarter. But just looking out more medium term, can you talk about the magnitude of fee growth you think you can generate and some of the drivers? I mean, obviously, it's incrementally important from here given the pressures on net interest income. And I guess I'm trying to maybe quantify the growth that you expect and again some of the drivers? Thanks. Well, Matt, I'll start, it's Bruce, John can pick up. But when I think about where we've been and how we've grown through time, we've pretty much been growing Commercial fees probably high-single digits, keeping pace with recently robust loan growth over that period. And that's reflective of the investments that we've made in building out the platform, hiring some great bankers, standing up our own global markets FX and interest rate business, investments in the cash management business, acquisitions of M&A shops. And I think we're really just gaining traction and reaping the benefits of those investments. So, I would expect to see continued good growth on the Commercial side. Q3 was a little bit of an air pocket. We think Q4 is going to be a bounce back quarter. On the Consumer side, we've had a harder time growing. I think we addressed some of those issues. We've been investing organically and building out the sales force and coverage folks in wealth and in mortgage. But I think the acquisitions that we've done particularly mortgage looks very timely in light of being able to catch the refi wave. But I think there's a lot we can really do with that business. So, it's really scratching the surface of its potential in terms of building out more tools for the correspondent and wholesale customers that we have. So I think we can grow our market share there very nicely, and then get better penetration into our branch channels which we continue to add LOs. So even though we came off a high with the refi wave, I think that will continue some through Q4 and early into the first half of 2020. But there's other levers to continue to, I think, gain market share in the mortgage business. And then wealth, we've now addressed the high end of the pyramid with Clarfeld and we're looking frankly to do more in terms of acquisitions to further that growth on the wealth side. So, if we average the Commercial and then the slower growth on Consumer I think with the rearview mirror, we probably were in the mid-single digits range and certainly we'd think that, that's a goal we could set going forward when we think out a number of years to at least be able to continue to do that. That was helpful. Can you just elaborate on the type or just maybe size of wealth deals that you'd be open to? I think you did a relatively modest one... Yeah. I think all these deals we've described as bolt-ons and I think what we really need to make sure of is it has a good strategic fit that the company has a great culture that's going to mesh well with us and that we can get attractive financial terms. And I think if you buy smaller, you can get a little better handle on all of those things. If you buy bigger, it's a little harder to achieve those three objectives. So, I would think we'll still consider these deals smart but more in the bolt-on category. So we probably need to do several to continue to scale up our business. Okay. Thank you. And we can go to the next line queue, it will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning. Hi. So, I wanted to – I know you've addressed this to a certain degree and I know there's a lot of volatility and then probably some seasonality in this, but can you just give a little bit more color on how we should think about what a more normalized run rate is for mortgage income assuming the long end of the curve stays where it's at? You had, I think, $80 million of production revenue, which is very strong, the MSR valuation gain. As we think about that going forward, how should we think about the sort of the moving parts there and what it could trend to not only in the fourth quarter but just beyond that? Yeah. Thanks for the questions. It's John here. I'd say, well, you could break that down into three P&Ls, right, and you talk about production and servicing and then the MSR valuation, net of the economic hedge, right? And when you go across each of those three, going forward, I think you could see production being – production P&L basically coming down a bit, right, in the fourth quarter, but I would call it higher than where it was in the second quarter, we had a good quarter in the second quarter, we had a phenomenal quarter in the third quarter. So I think maybe coming off those highs, but kind of stabilizing at higher levels than what we've seen in the past in production. We're really excited about that. Very strong production, really strong margins which is important to how we generate those revenues, and just a growing integration of the Franklin platform. So, that's how I see that part of the P&L. I'd say a similar comment on the operating servicing part of the P&L where we're having – we're retaining all the UPB that was previously being sold by this platform before we acquired it. So, our servicing UPB is growing nicely, as well as the servicing fees and ancillaries that we're recognizing on that P&L. So, with that, that P&L is stabilizing and rising and we're completing the full integration and insourcing of the servicing platform from what Franklin was using which was an outsourced platform to bring it in-house which will give us more control over data and direct access to the customers, so we're excited about that. And then, the last one, of course, is the MSR valuation, net of economic hedge. During the quarter, when we see large swings – this past quarter – these are positioned to benefit if mortgage spreads were to widen out, when we get to extremes we tend to moderate positions and assume that they will revert over time and they did. That's something that I think you could see more of in the future. And that will jump around a lot, but I think we've demonstrated a really solid job of managing the – what was otherwise a volatile asset for the last four quarters that we've added this platform, going into the fifth, we've managed that really well with the flat to upward bias on the MSR, net of economic hedge on. And, Brad, you might just want to add a little bit some of the innovation and new technologies that we're delivering in the mortgage business because I think it's quite exciting, what's actually... I was actually just going to do that. Just one thing I'll also chime in with John is, I think you hit it spot on. And one thing to keep in mind, the industry is quite full of capacity right now. And that gives us this great optimism around margin maintaining for a period of time. So the signs are good from a margin perspective. But the point, Bruce, that you made, we've invested heavily in our digital capabilities in the mortgage business. And so, we put a new digital front-end on to our origination platform. This past quarter alone, we saw more than a third of our applications come through the front-end digital platform, which gives us efficiency opportunities for one, but also gives us more opportunity to build direct to Consumer – the direct to Consumer side of the business. We also invested in digital capabilities on the back-end of the business with digital and mobile servicing application. We're seeing a lot of our customers transition over to using that digital platform on the back-end. So, a lot of good things happening other than just the rate environment. I mean, I think the integration, as you said, has gone extremely well and we're starting to reap the rewards of investments that we made in the digital capabilities and the service capabilities. That's great. No, thank you. That's great color. If I could switch gears and also ask a question on reserving and on CECL specifically. I mean, the day-1 impact's not a big deal from a capital standpoint. How do we think, John, about the day-2 impact of the CECL because a lot of your growth, if you look at the balance growth over the last year, relatively large portion of it is coming from education, it's coming from other retail lending that tends to either have longer tenors or higher loss content than others. And obviously has a higher provisioning load as you originate those loans. How do we think about the loan loss provisioning outlook in light of that loan growth and mix shift into 2020? Yeah. I think – so, we've just kind of come out with our first real quantitative outlook for – where this adopting the standard will affect us in early January. So, I mean I would say a couple of things, but also caveat that we have more work to do, and we're continuing our parallel runs and completing all the validation of our models. And so, with all of that said, I think there are two big forces that you have to think about. One is with all of those portfolios that are longer duration, we have a very big back book, and there the dynamic that we're dealing with is the fact that we're being asked to reserve over the entire life of the entire back book for those longer duration loans in early January. And so, going forward if our models are reasonably accurate and reflect the future, which is a big question for all banks, then really the provisioning for that entire back book is really behind us. And it's really already up on the balance sheet. And so what you're left with is the other side of that ledger which is the front book, and the front book originations that you have to basically put through P&L, all of the reserves over the life of the loan. So, I think for portfolio by portfolio, the gearing of ratios, if you will, the benefit of the fact that the back book is no longer being provisioned, which would otherwise have been provisioned in the incurred loss model under the existing standards is now going to be already handled and probably be closer to zero against the magnitude of the front book. And I think the answer with respect to whether that's positive, negative or neutral is varies by portfolio and that's going to play itself out. Yeah. And what I would say just to add to that is that we're working through our kind of three-year strat plan that we finished in July so you kind of overlay portfolio by portfolio, what's the interplay between those dynamics that John described, back book/front book, and then how does that play out from an accounting standpoint over, say, the next three years. There may be certain products twists that we're offering a longer duration version of a loan and they may not make as much sense. We might tweak something, but I would say that at the end of the day, the economics are the economics and the accounting is something we have to contend with. But we'll get on top of it and then obviously when we do our guidance in January, in the next call, we'll be able to take you through that in some more detail. But we're working at it, we're analyzing it, and I think we feel broadly fine about it. Got it. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Yeah. And next in the queue, we go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, Bruce and John. Hi, Gerard. Good morning. Bruce, you touched on growing the fee revenue and I wanted to zero in on the capital markets business since you guys have had good success in expanding that business. And I understand the second quarter, if I read the press release correctly, was a record level, third quarter came down a bit. So two questions, one, you mentioned the pipeline is very strong going into the fourth quarter. Can you compare that pipeline to prior quarters? Is it higher or lower? And then second, what will it take for you guys to bring this business up to maybe $70 million a quarter run rate? Is it hiring more people or expanding geographies? How can you grow it to that level? I'll let Don take it. Yeah. So, I think about – I'll talk about a combination of fee lines for the Commercial Bank activity. So, we saw FX and interest rates and commodity hedging activities for clients mostly running at incredibly strong levels over the last couple of quarters. So, maybe it was a little volatile this quarter, it hurt us on the capital markets day side and benefited us on the interest rate and currency side, and we're seeing that continue. On the capital markets side, we generally play in the middle market and middle market leveraged finance space. And what happened this quarter was that market was way down year-on-year and effectively the markets overall closed for about six weeks in the middle of the summer, as the Fed changed its interest rate posture. You saw a great lift in September on the back of it opening up for the bond market, and you've seen high yield activities grew exponentially. That all being said, I think that we've got the pieces in place to allow us to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves for really great growth area over the next quarter or two is going to be M&A as the acquisitions begin to kick in. So, we've been wanting to cover  (00:50:45) in terms of M&A fees, those should go up significantly this quarter, and the pipelines look very, very strong. So, our strategy is to get that fee line even higher or a couple fold, one is, in our high-yield business we start a high yield sales and trading activity this quarter which should allow us to take larger positions in high yield underwrites and our splits on transactions would double or triple, so that is on the high yield side of the business. We've been building credibility in our loan syndication leverage financing capability over four years and we're seeing larger transaction and even more transactions as we build comparables and a reputation for execution with our clients and with our investor base. And we're seeing this general activity growing into fourth quarter. Whether that continues in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter it's a little too early to say, but I think there's upside on all of those key elements. The other thing we try to do is grow our client base. So as Bruce said, at the time of the IPO, we moved into the mid-corporate, industry vertical sectors, we've built very strong corporate finance industry advisory teams. So, the way we're engaging with our clients, I would argue, maybe four or five years ago was very much around provisioning credit and now it's about advice and basically ownership transition and complex financing. And it's only been the last couple of years where we've had all of the pieces in place, and they're really gelling well, I think they're gelling well as I've seen anytime in my career and we're just in a lot of very interesting conversations with our client base. That just gives a good momentum... I would just add to that, Gerard. We have knocked on the door of a $60 million quarter before, I hate to put my neck on the line. But I think this fourth quarter shapes up potentially to be a record – a new record quarter for us in capital markets. So, we're not that far away on that $70 million a quarter. I don't think we really need to hire more people or acquire another M&A boutique to get to that kind of a level it would require. I think that markets are healthy and open over the next year and then some of those investments that we've made and the approach to how we cover, all that would have to continue to progress and come to fruition. But there's not a lot of incremental investment that we need to make in order to continue to drive higher revenues in this business. And further to that point, Gerard, just the question earlier about pipelines, our pipelines in early October are up across the board, whether you're looking at the combination of syndications and bond underwriting or FX, IRP and M&A in particular, they're all up since early July, when we look in early October just to close that up. Great. Thank you for the color. Bruce, since the BB&T/SunTrust merger, many investors and myself all thought more deals were going to be announced. Obviously, nothing's happened. But when you look at the BB&T stock, it's outperformed the general bank indexes, so it looks like the market is supporting that type of transaction. Is that something that Citizens could ever consider in the future? Well, I think the stock answer to that is we're going to always consider anything that benefits our shareholders. But I would say whether that deal proves to be a good one depends on the quality of the execution. And so you've had – and I've been part of a big MOE in Bank of New York Mellon. And the spreadsheets, when you announce the deals, always look great and then it comes down to you make the right personnel decision, do you get the cultures to mesh and do you fundamentally execute well. So we'll see if that happens. I think for us right now, we're very focused on continuing to run the bank better. And we're in a period of very rapid change in terms of customer expectations, new technologies, and we're very focused on being on the front foot with our TOP 6 program, some of our strategic investments. I think we can carve a path that's very exciting and fulfilling for our stakeholders by really staying focused on our own current agenda. One of the risks of getting involved in larger transactions is it can be distracting and take your eye off the ball in a period where you really have to be all over the current agenda. So, anyway those are few thoughts, Gerard. No, I appreciate your candor. Thank you. And our next question queue comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. It's really what sort of Brian Foran was asking earlier. So as I think about what's unique to Citizens as we look out over the next few quarters, obviously you've done a lot of work in terms of driving your business momentum upward and accelerating it, and, second, you do have high deposit costs. So as we think about beyond the fourth quarter, right, and you're still feeling good about loan growth, you're still feeling good about the economy. And based on the forward curves should we think that the worst case scenario for NII next year could be stable? I'm trying, Ellen. (00:56:34) Erika, it's John. I mean I think if you tune in for January, right, we'll come out with relatively specific expectations for what 2020 will be on NII. But I think – yeah, I think, yeah, the broad contours, the direction correct. I mean we expect – when you think about where our loan growth has been year-over-year, we're in the neighborhood of that 4% range, which is a percent or two above GDP. So, next year, we want to aspire to continue to grow the platform at levels that are similar to that or better. And that plus all of the work that we're doing on the net interest margin side of things, I mean, we did have, as you know, maybe some betas that we're in a tightening cycle, we had some deposit cost rises that were higher, but that's starting to retrace itself here and we'll see our deposit betas rising in the fourth quarter and continuing to reflect the fact that we've done an amazing amount of work on our deposit betas... And frankly, we've been outperforming now through the cut cycle on the deposit side. Yeah. So, in the second quarter, we did; and we outperformed. During the third quarter, we did. And I think you can almost consider a trajectory there that we expect – I'm sorry, in the third quarter, we did. In the fourth quarter, we're going to have a meaningful improvement in the interest-bearing deposit cost decline. So, we're excited about that. So, I think our key levers will cause that kind of stabilization that you're talking about, but stay tuned, we tend to try to... (00:58:18) Guidance now for January so. Yeah. Good try there... Yeah. ...yeah, trying to open up a little bit. Kind of. Yeah. I understand the timing is odd, but it just sounds like if you're relatively stable next quarter with pressure from October and not the underlying pressure from what's happened so far, so quickly with only taking your deposit costs down the way you did, it seems like – stable seems like a potential floor – just, I guess, I'm not asking you to confirm that, but that's just how I was looking at that, so. But I appreciate the color. That wasn't actually a question. I'm going to take myself off the queue now. We want to hear another question. Or do you have a question? All right. Thanks for that. Okay. Sure. And next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Hey, just a follow up on the overall balance sheet. You guys have shown really good deposit growth in the money market accounts and then the non-interest-bearing and obviously, we're starting to see the term deposits come down against that and Citizens Access kind of flattening out. Can you just talk us through just that mix and how you expect just overall balance sheet to traject from here, especially as loans look to be still growing and securities, you've kind of flattened out just given where that rate dynamic is. So, I guess just talk about the earning asset base and the mix within and how you'd expect that to go forward? Thanks, guys. Yeah. I mean, I think – so overall, you're seeing the fact that we continue to – year-over-year we're growing deposits of 6% and loans a bit less than that. So you look at the LDR ratio around 94.5% in the third quarter. That's down, reasonably – significantly less, so we are going to do the 98% or so, in probably, a year-and-a-half ago, a year or a year-and-a-half ago. So, I think that the balance sheet strength is quite good, really solid liquidity position as we head into the end of the year. Deposit growth has remained a bit greater than loan growth. That gives us optionality in terms of how we execute our playbook in terms of deposit pricing. And that's part of how we've been able to drive deposit costs down  (01:00:45) is all of the good works that we've been doing in terms of generating deposits. On the loan side, we gave you that color about the fact that year-over-year our trends were in that 4% range or so. That's something we'll aspire to accomplish over time, but deposit costs will continue to wholly fund loan growth. And I think that's our main... I think one piece of color I would add, Ken, is that we're quite pleased that we've been able to grow our demand accounts and outperform relative to peers. Brad, you might want to add some color on that. But really, the focus on the mass affluent customer and some of the investments we've made in customer experience and customer journey, we're gathering them, targeting them, getting them in the door using data analytics and then they stay. And so, retention is up there and that's really fueling that growth in demand accounts. Yeah. I think, you nailed it, Bruce. I think, we've talked for quarter-on-quarter about our investment in analytics and that has given us the ability to really target the right customers, improve the value proposition, which we've done that with a focus on the mass affluent client, which is deepening our relationship with them and we're getting them active quicker than we were in the past. And we're improving our attrition and our Net Promoter Scores are showing that they are much more satisfied customers. And we really think that's what's fueling the growth in noninterest bearing deposits. Yeah. Understood. Thanks for that. And one follow-up on the securities book, so the securities book, you mentioned that the premium amortization was a 3-basis point hit to the net interest margin. I'm just wondering, at this point, were you able to reinvest cash flows out versus the back book if we try to isolate for what's happening aside from the premium-am? Thank you. Yeah. I mean, I think on the front book, back book trends here, I mean, you've got reinvestments in the third quarter are around, call it, 250 or thereabouts, and you still have a positive front book, back book and securities with runoff between the neighborhood of 220 – 223, or so. So, I mean, I think, we're feeling, it's like against this backdrop, we've done a reasonably good job of holding our cash and investing and deploying that cash at points during the quarter where rates were a little higher. That's foresight. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to do that all the time, but we have a couple of quarters, we've been holding our powder a bit until some of the big declines in rates moderate and then we put all the cash to work. So like I said, we still got a positive, call it, 25 basis points or so of front book, back book on the securities portfolio. And one quick one just on the premium-am, if rates stay flat, does that 3-basis point headwind just go away, meaning does it – it goes to zero as an increment? If you expect – if you realize it on like a realized basis and is there any lag to the premium-am that will continue to roll forward just because of where rates have gone to? Thanks. Yeah, I think – there's a couple of factors. I mean, I think, our outlook is that it's going to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, such that the drag of 3 basis points this quarter was because there was an increase from 2Q to 3Q. Our current outlook was just – outlook for rates, et cetera, is that that will be flattish from 3Q to 4Q, so therefore no longer a rise. And then, over time, maybe that can moderate, but again back to 2020, I'll get back to you on that later, but yeah, that'll be flattish from 3Q to 4Q. Understood. Thank you. Okay. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Thanks. As you guys get ready to implement the TOP 6 initiative, are there any thoughts maybe that you'd be willing to delay investments, or maybe accelerate some of the planned cost saves just to insure you generate positive operating leverage going forward? Well, first off, we're trying to get this thing off the ground and we had a number of work steams basically, seven or eight work streams with individual leaders. And as soon as they're good to go and launched, we were already moving ahead. So, we've given the green light on two of those work streams are all ready and we'll have more of that launch in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the TOP program is accretive right away. So we want to get those things going quickly. But places where we would be in turn reinvesting, the next-gen tech is one of the big work streams. That has probably the most value of any work stream for the bank, in terms of how we're running the bank and how we can deliver for our customers. But it is somewhat reliant, it doesn't generate immediate savings, it requires some investment and then the saving come later. But as long as the rest of the streams are moving ahead, then our disposition is we got to move on that. It's really, really, critical. When we announced the TOP 6 program, we also talked about some strategic investments that we were assessing and prepared to make and those include further expansion of Citizens Access, our digital bank, or our point-of-sale merchant finance platform, or new ways to cover business, small business customers and low or middle market customers with more digital and data applied. And so, we're working through those. I think we have an ability to gate those based on how fast the savings comes through on the other streams and then also, the overall macro environment next year. And so, we do have this commitment that we've held fast to since the IPO of trying to deliver positive operating leverage and that's probably the lever that we have, would be to gate some of those investments. But our objective, our hope is that we can move on those, because I think they're really exciting and I think they really will drive medium term revenue growth for us. Great. That's really helpful. And because – I guess when I look at the medium-term profitability targets that you laid out, obviously the rate environment is much different than when you originally gave that. And so... Yes. I'm assuming you're still expecting to see then continued improvement in the profitability in terms of the efficiency and ROTCE. Yes, I mean that's the only way to really get it, is you're going to have to drive the operating leverage. One of the things to keep your eye on is if some of these trade tensions and concerns that are holding back the economy a little bit, abate, that obviously is going to be a tailwind into next year. And that could also result in the long end of the curve moving back higher. That's actually been a bit of a crusher when you look at ROTCE, because year-on-year growth in OCI related to the growth in the value of the securities portfolio actually is, what, 75 basis points of ROTCE. So, if you had the long end move back, you could actually throw that right back on to the equation. So, there is a number of factors there, but yes, commitment to operating leverage, key in terms of continuing to drive forward and reach those ROTCE goals. That's great. Thanks, Bruce. Yeah. And we'll go to our next question in queue, it comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Thanks. And this is a good question to follow that last question. When you look at banks, there are so many intricate details that we've spend all this time talking about, but really investing in it comes down to three different metrics. One is, return on tangible common equity, the other is the dividend yield, and third is basically how fast can you grow tangible value. So while your ROTCE has been under pressure, one statistic that hadn't really been talked about was your growth in tangible book value was 14% over the last year, which is the counter of that. So, when you look at those three metrics, let's say, assuming we don't have a credit event or credit downturn, how do you see those three metrics moving forward over the next, let's say call it, 12 to 24 months, given the environment that we have? Do you see progress in those metrics? Or where we're at right now is very positive, I think the valuation reflects some deterioration in those metrics, so just want to get your take on that. Yeah. I mean, obviously, the objective is to be driving the ROTCE and driving that tangible book value per share higher. And if we execute well and the environment stays okay or improves, I think we'll certainly be able to do that. If we do that the stock should reflect positively, so our dividend yield would go down, which wouldn't be a bad thing. Ultimately, we're still committed to raising our payout ratio and getting to a 35% to 40% dividend payout ratio. But the yield obviously is a function of the stock price. And then, John, I want to dive into a very – so from a big picture to a really minutia type of question. Given that what we're seeing as Consumer, allowances are going up precipitously on the CECL and Commercials are going down, while that day one impact is negative for those who have more Consumer – what I'm trying to get at is, as we go into day 2 through 200, if the Consumer because it is less lumpy and the Commercial is getting impacted because of how low we are in the cycle right now and their losses tend to come in in big pieces, is the Consumer possibly going to be less volatile over a cycle versus Commercial when you have big pieces coming in and out having to adjust those factors when you go through those economic cycles? Yeah. If we're still, I would say, developing our intuition about this new standard and how the models will work, I think, there are a series of factors that impact both sides. I think, just the prevailing market conditions and expectations of how your reasonable and supportable projections will revert over time. I think that has meaningful impact on both portfolios, to tell you the truth. It's one of the reasons why we've all been scratching our heads about why this standard was necessary. It's going to be very difficult to compare across institutions for a period of time and it's going to be a lot more difficult to, frankly, anticipate where P&L impact will go over time. All of that said, as you heard earlier from Bruce, economics are still something that we have to keep our eye on that ball and we'll deal with the capital impact as necessary. But I don't know that I'm ready to say that one of the two portfolios is going to be less volatile, I think, it's possible that either portfolio could contribute to significant volatility in any given period. And stay tuned for the continuing disclosures that we'll do on this in January as we finish our, frankly, our parallel run in our model validations which are happening here as we speak in the fourth quarter. Thanks, okay. All right. Ellen? Yeah, I think. Operator? Yes. No further question at this time. All righty. Very good. Well, thanks everyone for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you. And that does conclude the call for today. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the Ameris Bancorp Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Stokes, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Thank you, Ilie, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. During the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. I'm joined today by Palmer Proctor, our CEO, and Jon Edwards, our Chief Credit Officer. Palmer will begin with some opening general comments, and then I will discuss the details of our financial results before we open up for Q&A. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results could vary materially. We list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law. Also during the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in reference to the company's performance. You can see our reconciliation of these measures and GAAP financial measures in the appendix to our presentation. And with that, I will turn it over to Palmer for opening comments. Thank you, Nicole, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call today. I wanted to share a few highlights about the quarter and why we're excited about the rest of 2019 and then the opportunities we see coming into 2020. For the quarter, we earned $68.5 million or $0.98 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, which is up over 8% compared to the third quarter of last year. This represents a 1.57% return on average assets and 18.95% return on tangible equity. Our efficiency ratio increased to just over 57% which was expected as the cost saves from the Fidelity acquisition aren't fully realized yet and we're still running two core systems until November this year with the conversion. For the year-to-date period, we earned $156.3 million or $2.85 per diluted share on an adjusted basis which is actually up 19% over 2018 results, and this represents a year-to-date return on assets of 1.55% and a 7% improvement from the same period last year. We've been very pleased with our organic growth on both the loan and the deposit side. Our loan to deposit ratio has been very stable at 94%. And if you exclude the Fidelity acquisition, our loans actually grew over $283 million or almost 13% annualized during the third quarter alone. So that leaves our year-to-date annualized loan growth at 13.75% for the year and our annualized non-interest bearing deposit growth at 13.58% for the year which is pretty impressive. Our loan production in the banking segment was up 151% this quarter over the third quarter of last year. Yields, of course, were down on the new production as we would all expect with the recent Fed cuts, but the pipelines are encouraging, they're strong as we look into the fourth quarter. So, we feel very encouraged about that. As expected, we did see some dilution in tangible book value this quarter compared to last quarter, and that's really due to the Fidelity acquisition. But we anticipate that consistent growth in tangible book that you will see going forward as we're still having a pause on the M&A activity. But even with the dilution from the acquisition, we have tangible book growth of over 14% growth since September of last year, which is certainly noteworthy. Nicole is going to get into the financial details in a few minutes, but I did want to hit on a few things first. And looking back, it – and we'd like to do look-backs, what do we say versus what we did and looking back, what we said we were going to do last December when the Ameris-Fidelity merger was announced and where we are today, I'm really proud of our team's accomplishments. When we announced the deal, we had pro forma branches at about 199 branches combined. By the end of the third quarter, we're down to 172, which is a net reduction of 27 branches since the announcement of the merger. And we've done this very strategically and with very little attrition in terms of our core funding. And then also at announcement of the deal, we said there'd be $0.18 dilution on the EPS during 2019, but would then bring single-digit accretion in 2020 with the built-in cost saves. And we've actually had better than expected results so far based on our execution and accelerated execution of some of the cost save strategies earlier than we had initially expected. We projected our pro forma TCE to tangible asset ratio to be at 8.37% post-acquisition and we're reporting 8.43% TCE ratio today, which is slightly above our projections. And I mentioned all these things really to reinforce how serious we are about executing strategy and ensuring that we're on track with the plans that we have outlined. So far we've hit all the targets we're looking for and we've delivered on the goals we've established, and we're confident that hitting our targets is what's going to continue to create franchise value for our company and our investors, and it's going to position us exceptionally well for any economic environment that we operate in. One other noteworthy milestone that I'll mention in our company's history is that we have officially moved the bank charter and the holding company offices to Atlanta, and we'll become the largest bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia after the  through these (00:06:31) deal closes. We initiated the formal launch of our rebranding. Hopefully, some of you have seen that in terms of our strategy there this month. It's been very well received and we remain deliberate in terms of our efforts to drive that brand in all of our markets. One big point to mention is the integration. It's in full swing, it's going well. We've already – the SBA group has already been through conversion. The mortgage integration is about 75% complete as I sit here today, and it'll be fully completed by the time we do our core system conversion, that first week in November. But the way our operations and technology colleagues have worked through this integration has been amazing and we're right on track. And as I said in our press release, being able to deliver these kind of financial results that we did this quarter while also working through one of the largest integrations that our company has done is really a true direct reflection of the team and how hard all our bankers are working. And I look forward to having integration behind us in the fourth quarter so that we can get back to business and spend a 100% of our time on the organic growth opportunities, and continuing to execute the strategies that we have in front of us. But I'll stop there now and then turn it over to Nicole and let her discuss the financial results in more detail. Great. Thank you, Palmer. As you mentioned, Palmer, today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $68.5 million or $0.98 per share for the third quarter, and that's compared to $43.3 million or $0.91 for the third quarter of last year. These adjusted results primarily exclude about $65 million of merger charges, a $4 million gain on BOLI proceeds, about a $1 million recovery of MSR impairment from prior quarters and $889,000 of loss on the sale of branch building. Including these items, we're reporting total GAAP earnings of about $21.4 million or $0.31 per share. The $0.98 per share adjusted EPS represents an 8.5% increase over the $0.91 we earned in the third quarter last year. And the income, the $68 million of income represents a 58% increase over the third quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings. Our adjusted return on assets in the second quarter was 1.57%, which was an increase from the 1.56% reported last quarter and the 1.53% reported in the third quarter of last year. For the year-to-date period, our adjusted ROA is 1.55% compared to 1.46% last year-to-date, and as previously stated, we continue to aim for an ROA between 1.55% and 1.65% going forward. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 18.95% in the third quarter compared to 18.79% last quarter and 20.50% in the third quarter of last year. For the year-to-date period, our 2019 adjusted return on tangible common equity is 18.87% compared to 18.47% last year. As expected we saw a decline in tangible book value this quarter due to the Fidelity acquisition. We ended the quarter with tangible book value per share at $20.29 down $0.52 from the $20.81 at the end of June. While this dilution in tangible book value was larger than anticipated and is a result of additional contract termination fees from certain vendor contracts, tangible book value is still up over 14% from this time last year. All of our additional merger expenses that are related to the contract terminations will result in future cost savings as we work to improve processes going forward. We believe that all significant merger and conversion charges have been recorded in the third quarter, and no material additional expenses are anticipated going forward related to the Fidelity integration. Our tangible common equity ratio decreased 25 basis points to 8.43% from 8.68% at the end of the second quarter which was also in line with our projections. We expect that our capital build will continue and we still plan on finishing 2019 with double-digit growth in tangible book value per share. Our GAAP net interest margin declined by 7 basis points from 3.91% to 3.84% during the quarter. There was a lot of moving parts, so I'm going to try to take this slow. And I apologize, some of this is going to be a repeat from last quarter, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear on the margin. So, if you go back to last quarter, we anticipated the Fidelity acquisition was going to negatively impact our margin by 11 basis points. We anticipated that every 25 basis point cut would reduce our margin by another 5 to 6 basis points, except for that first cut in July because we had enough tailwinds to absorb that. Well, we did a litter better than expected. The Fidelity merger impacted our margin by approximately 9 basis points and the first cut in July impacted our margin by approximately 3 basis points. We notice on the balance sheet we had extra loans held for sale and we also use FHLB borrowings to fund that held for sale activity because of the mortgage and we're going to talk about that a little bit later. But the impact of having those extra held for sale loans, holding those loans longer at a smaller spread, that impacted our margin by about 4 basis points, and then we had tailwinds including purchase accounting in the quarter that offset about 9 basis points of margin compression. So we ended up with really only 7 basis points of margin compression rather than the 11 that we had anticipated. During the third quarter, our yield on earning assets declined by 9 basis points while our funding costs only decreased 4 basis points. However, our total interest-bearing deposit cost decreased 11 basis points as we continue to stay focused on our deposit costs. And we continue to believe that every 25 basis point cut by the Fed will squeeze our margin by 5 to 6 basis points, so we plan or hope to manage the 4 to 5 basis points. Our core bank production yields declined to 5.08% for the quarter against 5.49% in the second quarter. On the deposit side, we continued the momentum on noninterest bearing deposits and improved our mix such that noninterest bearing now represent 29.85% of our total deposits compared to 28.9% at the end of the second quarter and 25.4% this time last year. Noninterest bearing deposit production was over 13% of our total deposit production. Growth in noninterest income was exceptional during the third quarter. As we talked about just a second ago, in addition to the increase in service charges because of the additional deposit account from Fidelity, that was partially offset by the Durbin impact this quarter. But our combined mortgage group had record production and earnings due to the interest rate environment. During the third quarter, mortgage revenue grew over 186% compared to the second quarter of this year and over 276% from the same period last year, and a large portion of that is with the addition of the new Fidelity team. Mortgage production continued to hit record levels although we saw a decline in the gain on sale to 2.67% down from 3.11% last quarter, and that gain on sales spread was impacted by a shift in product mix as well as a transition of the Fidelity pricing model and the Ameris pricing model. Loan production in the retail mortgage segment was 278% higher than the third quarter because of the addition of the Fidelity bankers to the team, as well as the increased productivity from the low interest rate environment. We do not anticipate mortgage activity to stay at this high level, and we believe it will return to a more normal historical volume in the fourth quarter. Historically, Ameris did about $2 billion of production a year and Fidelity did about $3 billion a year for a combined production of $5 billion. They did $1.8 billion just in the third quarter, which is about a 48% combined increase in production over historical third quarter levels. And they did this production while being distracted with the integration. Because of this volume and operational strain of the integration, we ended the quarter with higher than anticipated mortgage loans held for sale which we funded with short-term FHLB advances. We believe these loans will be packaged and sold as quickly as possible in the fourth quarter, and our held for sale numbers as well as wholesale borrowings to fund those will come back down during the fourth quarter, and as already discussed, that will help with the margin in the fourth quarter. As Palmer already mentioned, the mortgage integration is approximately 75% complete. Our adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 57.25% this quarter because we do not have the full system integration complete and we still have administrative cost overhang from the Fidelity acquisition. We previously guided that we plan to maintain an efficiency ratio below 60% for the remainder of 2019 and we're well in line with that expectation. We actually did a little better than expected because of earlier execution of some of the cost saves. Total noninterest expense were $192.7 million for the quarter. However, when you remove the merger and conversion charges and the loss on sale of branches, our adjusted noninterest expense was about $127 million, which is up $51.5 million from the second quarter. Approximately $26 million or half of that increase was in the core bank and administrative functions due to the Fidelity acquisition. Income in this area also increased by about $42 million equating to a 62% efficiency ratio on that growth, without a fully realized cost base that will realize after data conversion in the fourth quarter. Most of the remaining $25 million increase in noninterest expense was in the retail mortgage division, mostly in salaries and commissions. This increase is attributable to increased production both because of the Fidelity acquisition, as well as the low interest rate cycle this quarter. As I already stated, production increased by over 200% in that division and revenue increased to over $39 million, which is more than enough to cover this increased expense. On the balance sheet side, organic loan growth was about $283 million or just over 12% annualized. The details of this production have been included in the investor presentation, but it was split among our bank segment and our lines of business with approximately 35% of the growth in the core bank and the remaining growth split evenly between mortgage and warehouse, premium finance and specialty lines. I sound like a broken record on credit quality, but it remains strong. I'm sitting next to Jon Edwards, our Chief Credit Officer, who's available to take any questions during the Q&A, but I will hit just a few high points. Our annualized net charge-off ratio was 7 basis points of total loans and 19 basis points of non-purchased loans. Our non-performing assets as a percent of total assets increased to 73 basis points compared to 51 basis points last quarter, and this was due to the Fidelity acquisition. The quarter-end NPA number was 19 basis points less than the projected number from our original due diligence, and also the diversification across loan type and geography can be seen in the loan slides as well. And then the final thing I'd like to touch on before I turn it back over to Palmer is the integration, but not just the data conversion but the actual team integration. And I have to tell you that things are going very well. As Palmer mentioned earlier, we moved the holding company headquarters to Atlanta earlier in this month. The majority of the executive team members are living in Atlanta with several of us relocating ourselves and our families there recently. I personally closed on my home last week in Atlanta, not to have more stress on quarter end by buying a new home, and I'm learning all about what real traffic really – what traffic really means. But honestly and seriously, we're all committed to Ameris and what the future holds for us. The relationships we have as a team and the leadership we've received from Palmer has really made the team dynamics and this transition easier than any of us anticipated. With that, I'll turn it back over to Palmer for closing comments. Thank you, Nicole. I'd like to conclude with this comment. As you know, so much of life and opportunities about timing and I can tell you that our timing for bringing everything together here at Ameris whether it be our teammates, our board, our systems or the overall integration, it couldn't be better as we position the bank to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us in the markets in which we operate. And we're definitely in the right place at the right time and, more importantly, we have the right teammates to make it happen. So with that, I'd like to thank everyone again for listening in for our third quarter earnings results. As we look forward to the rest of 2019 and to what 2020 holds for us. I'll turn it back over now to Ilie for any questions from the group. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question comes from Casey Whitman with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning. Good morning, Casey. Great quarter. Just a few questions with regards to loan growth. Just more broadly I was wondering if you would just talk to us about the organic loan growth at the bank segment and production this quarter, is a lot of that being driven by the Atlanta market, or are you seeing good growth throughout your markets? I guess my question would just be what markets are growing more than others, or are there more opportunities in particular markets for you guys. Yeah, Casey, good morning. Right now, where we're seeing most of the loan growth, the predominant loan growth this last quarter and the activity in terms of production is coming out of Atlanta and then parts of our Florida market, in that order. Okay. All right. And then also you referenced the sale of I think a corporate finance group portfolio in the quarter. Can you just give us an idea of the timing of that sale and kind of the decision there? Sure, Casey. That was the corporate finance division that we got with the Hamilton acquisition last year, and from a credit and a risk, we really were not big fans of that portfolio. So that had been planned for a while to dispose of that, and to sell those loans, they had been moved to held for sale during the second quarter and then we closed on that during the third quarter – September of the third quarter. September, all right, helpful, thank you. And lastly on the loan growth would just be the indirect auto, I guess how has the runoff been trending in that and can you just remind us of what we can expect the runoff to be per quarter in that book? Sure. So, when we did the acquisition of Fidelity, it was about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Today, or at the end of September, it was down to $1.05 billion and the runoff on that is about $130 million to $150 million a quarter. And it's paying off just as we had – as it always has. Just one thing about that line of business is very predictable in terms of cash flow and it continues to perform that way, and asset quality remains pristine. Great. Thank you. I'll just ask one more and let somebody else jump on. Just with regard to expenses, you mentioned some accelerated cost saves in your prepared remarks. Can you just sort of remind us or walk us through how much more on cost savings you have to come out of line between the fourth and first quarter, between the bank and the mortgage groups and just to sort of help us out with how we should think about the timing of all those cost saves hitting? Sure. So we had anticipated about 20% of those coming into the third quarter – coming out of the third quarter I should say and then about 30% coming out in the – another 30% coming out in the fourth quarter and then the rest of it coming out in 2020. So we have our data conversion set for the first weekend of November. And so we still have what I call kind of some of that overhang of expenses from running two systems, and so that's really the pickup in the fourth quarter over the third quarter is that we'll have a lot of those administrative costs gone and the  duplicate of systems (00:22:56) by the end of November. So we were a little bit ahead of our cost saves. We had projected 20% and we're closer to 25% to 30%, and then we anticipate another 20% to 25% in the fourth quarter which is similar to what we had said before. It's just we picked up 5% more in the third quarter, and then the rest still coming out in the first quarter. Very helpful. Thank you guys for the questions but – go ahead, Nicole. Perfect. Thank you, Casey. All right. Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Thank you. Good morning. Good Morning. Question, will any of this mortgage production activity bleed into fourth quarter? Jennifer, the piece that might bleed, so we have – it's the bundling and the selling of that, but we have those market fair value, so we don't anticipate. Now there could still be, I mean I don't think all of the volume just shut off September 30. So there will be some overhang, like a little bit, but we really think the fourth quarter is going to come back to more normal volume. The biggest impact in the fourth quarter is going to be the bundling and selling of those loans. But there shouldn't be an income statement impact for that. But as Nicole said too, Jennifer, the momentum is certainly there and so that will carry us into the fourth quarter but it will be on a much more normalized rate than what we experienced this quarter. Okay. Nicole, do you guys have a preliminary estimate for your loan loss reserve adjustment for CECL? That's a great question, Jennifer. And what – we have not given out guidance in the past with a specific number. With the Fidelity acquisition coming on, we have run that third quarter run and we're still analyzing that. I think there will be some additional guidance in the 10-Q about that. What we have said and we'll continue to say even with this – knowing that it's only October 18 and to get all of the Fidelity data from two systems into the CECL model is that we still are not surprised and then what the model is showing is still in line with our projections. So we're certainly not surprised with the results. And I think there'll be more guidance in our third quarter Q that we filed with the SEC. Okay. One last question, any hiring done during the third quarter? You mentioned disruption opportunities, just get some more color there. Well, for us, fortunately, just given our position in the market, the disruption we're able to take advantage of with our existing teammates without having to really bring in a lot of new folks. But that being said, we are constantly in front of a lot of folks right now. I think we'll start seeing more movement there as we move into the fourth quarter. We have made a few new hires, couple down in Florida in particular but that – we've got a very active pipeline to answer your question. Thanks so much. Thank you, Jennifer. Our next question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Tyler. Hey. I wanted to start on the mortgage business and you mentioned a couple of times expecting fourth quarter to return to more normalized levels. So just to be clear, are you kind of saying go forward is roughly $5 billion but with the normal kind of bell curve seasonality in the summer months, so then we should see $5 billion roughly annually with fourth quarter kind of dropping off seasonally? That's right. And so the third quarter results were about 43% elevated over – if you look at the historical third quarter of Ameris and the third quarter of Fidelity, you put those together were elevated – I'm sorry, were elevated about 60% and we think about 43% of that is related to the kind of the low rate environment. We saw a little bump in our – I mean our refinance as opposed to purchase. And so fourth quarter, we're expecting to go back down. So if you took the Fidelity fourth quarter run rate and the Ameris fourth quarter run rate, historically kind of go back to that plus maybe a 10% to 15% bump, just because of the year-over-year growth. Okay. Got it. And then, Nicole, do you have what the purchase versus refi mix was in the third quarter? I do. So, we typically both run about 85%. Well, actually Fidelity was a little bit higher. Ameris ran about 85% purchase and 15% refi, and Fidelity ran about 89% purchase. And this quarter, it dropped to 70% – about 71%, 72% purchase. On a combined basis? On a combined basis, that's right. Yeah. Got it. And is this kind of 2.67% gain on sale margin that you saw in the third quarter, is that what you'd expect going forward as a normalized level? I think it will normalize over time, so that in 2020, it will get closer – back to a normal, a little bit higher closer to the Ameris gain on sale number. But I don't think that'll be instantaneous in the fourth quarter. Okay. Got it. And then I – the mortgage business had, I think, a $1.3 million servicing right recovery. I guess how much servicing income did you realize this quarter, and then any thoughts on what you plan to do with that servicing portfolio? The servicing portfolio at this point, we've looked at several different functions as opportunities to do that. And as of right now, the plan is to retain that and to continue to service that through today and Tyler,  (00:28:44) I don't have that number right in front of me. I'll have to  (00:28:46). That's fine. (00:28:48). That's fine. And I guess lastly just on kind of mortgage related, you mentioned the held for sale balance is coming back down. Is there a normalized level of HFS that you'd plan to keep now with Fidelity in the fold? Yeah. We think that that normalized level is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million would be a normalized number combined. And just a kind of – it's a great – it's really not necessarily your question, but I mean it's a great time for me to talk about that. One of the things with our mortgage companies coming together going through the integration, one thing that they really focused on was continuing to service the customer, so they didn't slow production. They were able to continue and the piece that did get kind of slowed down was that back room of packaging and getting them sold. So that's really why that number grew, but again, we expect that to go down, probably a more normalized number is between $400 million and $450 million. Perfect. Okay. I'll hop out. Thanks. Thank you, Tyler. Our next question comes from David Feaster with Raymond James. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning, David. David. So I'd like to just start on the margins. So I guess looking at the fourth quarter with the held for sale wind-down that you talked about being about 4 basis points help and then the indirect runoff offset by a September cut, it sounds like you think you can hold your core NIM barely steady here? So, when you think about that September cut, that really was – even though it was a third quarter event, we don't have the really impact of that in the third quarter because it was so late in the third quarter and then if we had another cut, so no, we're still guiding that we could have 4 to 5 basis points of margin compression in the fourth quarter. And then there could potentially be another cut. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you just give us some thoughts on your accretion expectations going forward? Sure. So the only guidance that we've given is for 2019 because we're being cautious because of seasonal impact for next year. And you'll see that our accretion income went up this quarter by about $1 million, $1.1 million, and so that that's about the normal run rate for the fourth quarter as well. Okay. And then just following up on the loan origination strength that you're seeing in Atlanta, obviously, there is a lot of disruption there as you mentioned. Could you just talk about – we've talked before about you wanting to get more in that middle market there which is a huge opportunity, how's that going, what success have you seen in the middle market in Atlanta? Yeah, Tyler (sic) [David] (00:31:33), we're starting to see success. So obviously, there is a lead time on those relationships and a lot of them been locked down for years. But what we're starting to see is some movement there and it's on the lower middle market end, and that's where we're really focused. And so I think as we move especially into 2020, that's where we'll start seeing more of that lift. But the migration of those relationships certainly is – there's a lead time with that. But we're encouraged by not just the opportunities but the execution on that especially in the Atlanta market. Okay. And then I guess just high level, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the markets? Anecdotally, we've heard that pricing competitions increase in that, underwriting standards are loosening with less recourse and lower levels of leverage. Are you seeing a similar phenomenon and are there any segments or markets where you're seeing that more? No, I will tell you competition is fierce in terms of pricing. But I will tell you that all the banks that we run into in terms of competition, nobody is compromising on the asset quality itself. Structures are getting a little bit looser in terms of duration and pricing, but there aren't any deals out there that we're seeing and other banks do that just don't make sense, which is encouraging for us as an industry. That being said, there's still a lot of movement out there. And in terms of the different sectors, we have certainly pulled back a little bit, just through a discipline and a caution on a lot of our commercial construction. But that's more just us positioning ourselves in terms of capital as a percentage of some of these construction loans not because we're seeing any cracks or inherent cracks in any sectors out there. And if you look at absorption especially on the multi-family side and on the single family side, it's all still very strong. There's actually a lack of inventory in a lot of our metro markets. So we still feel very encouraged by what we're seeing, and right now do not see any or anticipate any cracks in the near future. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Our next question comes from Woody Lay with KBW. Morning, guys. Good morning, Woody. So it's good to see the interest-bearing deposit costs come down. I was just wondering what impact Fidelity had on that number and sort of what impact was just legacy Ameris cost of deposits? That's a great question. So the Fidelity impact was included in that their deposit costs were about 25 basis points less than ours. And then also we dropped deposits across the board. So it's a little bit hard to give an exact number because Fidelity, we dropped their rate with the July cut and the Ameris rate with the July cut as well. So it was absolutely a blended of both items. Got it. And I think last quarter, you said you were assuming a 50% deposit data in your margin guidance, is that still holding true? Yes. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Hey. Good morning. Palmer and Nicole, I wanted to drill back down on the competition comment a few minutes ago. How often do you have price concessions either on deposits or loans. And as you move relationships in the future, is that going to be part of the equation or something that you can avoid? Well, it's something we certainly try to avoid. And I would say we have less concessions on the deposit side and more concessions on the loan side, so as a result – because we look at it from a relationship standpoint, Chris. And so we are – we do feel the pressure more on the loan side than people trying to beat us down on the deposit side, so we look at holistically. But that being said, I think the important thing is to make sure we aren't looking at just transactions and looking at the entire relationship which is how the bankers are. We're getting floors in some of our deals wherever we can which I find hard to believe, I didn't think we'd be saying that again, but we are getting floors, and people now borrowers in particular are more sensitive to that and aware of that. But we have been successful in implementing some of the floors especially if we're being competitive on the rate. Over time, is there a percentage of the portfolio that you think will have floors, I know it's kind of an evolution as you reset? Well, I would love for a higher percentage to have floors. But right now, I think we're able or we're more successful in obtaining the floors is obviously on the residential construction lending, on the commercial side as we're trying to take business and take more market share and having to be more competitive, that's where we're having less success in terms of the floors but we're having more success and where you'll see it is on the liability side in terms of bringing over that core funding. So, if you look at the balance there in terms of the NIM pressure while we may be given a little bit of yield up on the loan side, we're hopefully garnering more on the low cost funding side to offset that. Got it. That's helpful. Okay great. And the last question just has to do with the systems conversion. Once that's behind you, to what extent are there new products and sales that you can implement other things kind of in the wings that you'll see next year? Well, the exciting part of that is more looking at the efficiency. We're a big user of Salesforce and nCino, and fortunately both companies, legacy Fidelity and Ameris utilize that technology, and you'll see us leveraging more and more of that not only in specific areas but throughout the bank. Obviously, a new online account opening, we're focused on streamlining that process. But a lot of what we're going to be focused on is tweaking the current technology we have and just making it more efficient, the process more efficient. Banks today still have way too much bureaucracy in terms of execution. And the fun thing about being a $17 billion, $18 billion bank is being able to make small tweaks here and there that can be meaningful in the overall scheme of things, where there's just reduction of paper or just efficiency through less printer use, just a lot of simple technologies there that we're zeroing in now. And so our Chief Innovation Officer, which is our CIO obviously is – that's his sole mission right now. Great. Thanks again, guys. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our third quarter accomplishments on slide 3. We continued to deliver strong results this quarter. Earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.60 per share, included a reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart consumer portfolio, which positively impacted results by $0.38 in the third quarter. Loan receivables were down 5%. However, on a core basis, excluding the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables grew 6%. Net interest income grew 4%, purchase volume was up 5%, and average active accounts increased 2%. Our efficiency ratio of 30.8% was down from 31% in the prior year, and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we grew deposits $3.7 billion, or 6%, over last year, and much of this growth has come through direct deposits. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth, and we are making ongoing investments to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers. Brian will detail some of our efforts here shortly. We are pleased to share our recent partnership renewals and extensions. In our Retail Card sales platform, we announced the expansion and extension of our strategic consumer credit relationship with PayPal. We will become the exclusive issuer of Venmo's co-branded consumer credit card, which will launch in the second half of 2020. The new Venmo credit card program will combine Venmo's expertise in mobile design and social user experience with Synchrony's industry leading technology and data analytics to create personalized shopping and payment experiences for Venmo customers. We also extended our existing relationship with PayPal. This is a new milestone in our 15-year strategic partnership with PayPal, in which we continue to leverage our digital technology and expertise to help our partner grow their business through new, innovative consumer experiences. We also renewed our partnership with DICK'S Sporting Goods, a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer that offers an extensive assortment of sports equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories. Building on a nearly two decade partnership, this agreement will continue to provide customers with special financing promotions and accelerated rewards program and digital account management through the ScoreRewards branded credit card and co-branded Mastercard credit programs. These cards can be used on DSG.com and across their 700-plus retail stores, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Golf Galaxy, and Field & Stream. This strategic partnership strengthens the intersection of digital and in-store customer experiences for DICK'S cardholders. In Payment Solutions, we had another active quarter for renewals, recently signing renewals with Polaris, La-Z-Boy, and Conn's. Growing our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards is a key priority. We have had many recent successes on that front in our CareCredit network. We continue to expand CareCredit's network of more than 230,000 healthcare providers and retailers nationwide that accept the CareCredit card, including 8,500-plus Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. We also added Loyale, wherein CareCredit will be offered as a payment option on Loyale Patient Financial Manager, an end-to-end patient financial engagement platform. This provides consumers more locations where they can use the CareCredit card for their health and wellness needs. We also signed a new partnership with St. Luke's University Health Network. We're also focused on innovative digital technology, data analytics, and seamless customer experiences, all of which are fundamental to the success of our existing programs and to winning new ones as we have proven. We continue to invest in digital innovations to ensure our cardholders have access to their cards, rewards, and account information across whatever channel they choose to use. The digital sales penetration across all of our Retail Card consumers have been growing. Digital sales penetration was 35% in the third quarter. Overall, 50% of our applications are happening online, with the mobile channel alone growing 22% over the same quarter of last year. Our capital allocation strategy drives strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and the ability to return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of Synchrony Financial common stock and paid $145 million in dividends. Overall, it was a strong quarter. We made progress on our strategic initiatives. We continued to develop our digital and data capabilities, which is helping us to win in the marketplace, and we are making investments in our direct-to-consumer business. We maintained broad based growth, growing both organically and via new programs, and we continued to expand our network. All of this is happening as we maintain focus on the future and the dynamics that are reshaping the consumer experience. Earlier this month, we successfully completed the sale and conversion of the Walmart portfolio and program. I would like to thank our team for working hard to deliver excellent service, ensuring the customer was a top priority throughout the process and executing a seamless transition. Before I turn the call over to Brian to discuss our progress in our direct-to-consumer business, I will highlight our platform results on slide 4. In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our digital partners, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Walmart portfolio. Loans were down 11%, but excluding the Walmart portfolio, they were up 5%. Interest and fees on loans increased 6% over last year, and purchase volume grew 5%. Average active accounts were up 1%. We're happy to expand and extend our relationship with PayPal through the addition of a Venmo co-branded consumer credit card. We are also happy to renew our relationship with DICK'S Sporting Goods, which includes their Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream brands. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. We generated broad-based growth across the sales platform, with particular strength in home furnishings and power that resulted in loan receivables growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 5% and average active accounts increased 3%. We renewed key partnerships this quarter, continuing to drive growth organically through our partnerships, and also through our Payment Solutions card networks, the Synchrony HOME and Synchrony Car Care credit cards. These networks, along with other initiatives, such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 29% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas, have helped to drive results and further build the Payment Solutions platform for future growth. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts increased 4%. We continued to expand our network and the utility of our cards, helping to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the third quarter. We drove strong growth across our sales platforms. We extended and expanded relationships, grew our Payment Solutions and CareCredit network, and increased cards utility, all providing a strong base for continued future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Thanks, Margaret. Good morning, everyone. My comments today will center on our efforts to diversify through our direct-to-consumer channel, starting on slide 5. Among our top strategic priorities is evolving and growing our business through the development of new Synchrony-branded products and services. More specifically, our objective is to become a leading digital bank with competitive products and capabilities that drive deeper customer relationships and provide an attractive source of funding, while also launching innovative lending products. While we've been introducing Synchrony-branded consumer products over the past few years through our Synchrony Car Care and Synchrony HOME offerings, we have also recently been focused on a Synchrony-branded general purpose card. Today I will spend a few minutes outlining how we are progressing on both our banking platform and the general purpose card. First, on our deposit products, we have made significant progress over the last several years in building our consumer banking platform. Our deposits are growing faster than the US direct banking industry and we have expanded market share over the last several years. Deposits currently comprise 76% of our funding profile, with consumer deposits becoming an increasingly larger portion of our mix of total funding. The investments we've made over the past few years have enabled us to rely less on rate to attract new deposit accounts. Our strategic investments have been focused on enhancing our digital advertising, developing the right content and message to the right audiences, as well as enhancing our digital experience. For example, we launched our new native app earlier this year, as well as redesigned our marketing site with a better user interface and overall customer experience. On slide 6 you can see the results of our efforts. Over the past several years, we have grown deposits 20% per year versus an industry growth rate of 5%. During that time period, we have also been less reliant on rate and have successfully reduced our savings product rate below the competition, as shown on the slide. We have also reduced our acquisition costs by 20% in the last three years. We remain focused on making investments to reduce rate sensitivity and acquisition costs. As we look ahead, we plan to invest in additional capabilities, products, and features. We will also continue to improve customer service and launch differentiated rewards and loyalty programs, all of which not only will drive a better customer experience, but also allow us to continue to grow efficiently and effectively. Importantly, we are focused on all aspects of the customer experience, starting with a quick, seamless account opening process, all the way through self-servicing features once the account is opened. We are confident that we have built a solid foundation from which to build for our future objectives in the deposit platform. Similarly on the lending side, we have made significant progress with our general purpose card. As you'll recall, we successfully rebranded Toys\"R\"Us accounts that qualified for our Synchrony Mastercard, which was a substantial portion of the portfolio. This was a cost effective way to expand into the general purpose card market, while also providing continuous and improved utility for our former cardholders. Slide 7 highlights our initial results with this product. We had a strong activation rate and repeat usage. In fact, we have also increased sales per account by 40% and balances per account by 50%. At the same time, we are  (00:14:32) as we no longer pay the RSA and use our savings to fund the value prop on the card. Approaching a general purpose credit card in this manner has allowed us to utilize an iterative test and learn approach to growth. We're leveraging customer insights and data to test general purpose card value propositions and features with consumers. At launch, we offered an attractive 2% cash back value proposition, as well as spend incentives, which delivered a strong card and spend activation rate. We are currently testing different combinations of APRs, promotional offers, and incentives. We are taking a very disciplined approach to future product offerings, value propositions, and features. Looking ahead, we will target our marketing efforts to customer segments where we believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. While our growth expectations are modest in the short-term, given the disciplined nature of our approach, we are excited about the opportunity and early results we've been able to achieve so far. As we seek to diversify our offerings in the direct-to-consumer space, we will leverage the foundations we have built. We are evaluating opportunities across a large and diverse market, and we're very excited about our prospects in this space. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 8 of the presentation. This morning we reported second quarter earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.60 per diluted share. This included the reduction in the reserve related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October. As Margaret noted earlier, the reduction totaled $326 million, or $248 million after-tax, and provided an EPS benefit of $0.38 to the quarter. Now that the portfolio sale and program conversion is complete, I will provide some details in how this and other factors impact our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. We generate strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas, as noted on slide 9. Excluding the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables were up 6%. Interest and fees on loan receivables were also up 6% over last year, driven by the growth in receivables. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth. Purchase volume growth was 5% and average active accounts increased 2% over last year. Excluding the impact of the Walmart program, purchase volume growth was 7% and average active account growth was 3%. RSAs increased $145 million, or 17%, from last year. Improved program performance and growth drove the increase. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.5% for the quarter. The provision for loan losses decreased $432 million, or 30%, from last year, mainly driven by the reduction in reserve related to the Walmart portfolio. The core reserve build was $124 million in the quarter. Other expenses increased $10 million, 1% over last year, driven by growth that was partially offset by the cost savings executed in advance of the Walmart portfolio sale and program conversion. Holding expenses essentially flat enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage for the quarter, reflected in the improvement in the efficiency ratio from 31% last year to 30.8% this quarter. So overall, the company continued to generate strong results in the third quarter. I'll move to slide 10 to cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 4%, driven primarily by the growth in loan receivables. The net interest margin was 16.29% compared to last year's margin at 16.41%, down 12 basis points. The main factors driving the margin performance were – factors lowering our net interest margin include a slightly lower mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets compared to last year, and an increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost of 35 basis points to 2.71% primarily due to higher benchmark rates. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in loan receivables yield of 31 basis points to 21.42%, which included the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal Credit program in the prior year. Later in the call, I will provide more insight on the direction of net interest margin for the fourth quarter, including the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Next I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47% compared to 4.59% last year, and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.07% versus 2.09% last year. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency was flat to last year, and the 90-plus delinquency rate improved approximately 5 basis points compared to last year, reflecting continued stabilizing credit trends. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.35% compared to 4.97% last year and 6.01% last quarter, and was somewhat lower than our expectation of 40 to 50 basis point decline from the second quarter. While credit trends continued to improve, this was partially offset by the purchase accounting impact in 2018 related to the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio, the net charge-off rate was approximately 20 basis points lower than last year. The allowance for the loan losses as a percent of loan receivables was 6.74% and the core reserve build in the third quarter was $124 million excluding the impact from the reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart portfolio. The reduction related to the Walmart portfolio was $326 million, which was higher than the expected $250 million due to the timing of the portfolio of sale occurring earlier in October. As a result, the remaining reduction in loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter will be in the $35 million to $40 million range. We expect the core reserve build for the fourth quarter will be in the $100 million to $150 million range, driven mainly by growth. Consistent with the outlook we provided, we did see stronger core loan receivable growth in the third quarter of 6% and believe this will continue into the fourth quarter. The acceleration in growth reflects the opportunities we have in the fast-growing digital space, and the expansion of our network and acceptance in CareCredit and the auto and home networks in Payment Solutions. Regarding net charge-offs. We expect the net charge-offs for 2019 will be towards the lower end of the 5.7% to 5.9% range, with a slight increase compared to 2018 driven mainly by the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in October. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate for 2019 is expected to be similar to 2018. Finally, regarding the implementation of CECL, which is effective in 2020, we believe the initial impact is consistent with what we disclosed last quarter. We will incorporate the estimated impact of CECL's transition adjustment and impact in next year's outlook when we provide our guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. In summary, credit trends have stabilized and are showing improvement. We expect the trends to continue to show stability as we move forward, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Moving to slide 12, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, an increase of $10 million, or 1%, compared to last year. The increase was driven by growth, but was partially offset by cost savings executed in advance of the Walmart portfolio sale and program conversion. Holding expenses basically flat enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage for the quarter, reflecting the improvement in the efficiency ratio from 31% last year to 30.8% this quarter, in line with our expectations. Now that the sale of the Walmart portfolio and the program conversion has been completed, we do expect the final portion of the cost associated with the Walmart program to be eliminated in the fourth quarter and be fully reflected in the expense run rate for 2020. Moving to slide 13, over the last year we've grown our deposits $3.7 billion, or 6%, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 76% of our funding compared to 72% last year. In July, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured debt. The issuance has a three-year term with a fixed rate of 2.85% and had strong demand. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.2% on a fully phased-in basis last year. The CET1 level increased over the past year even as the company deployed a significant amount of capital through organic growth, program acquisitions, and continued execution of our capital plans, reflecting the company's strong capital generation capabilities. During the quarter, we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share and repurchased $550 million, or 15.6 million shares, of common stock during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we have approximately $2.7 billion of remaining share repurchase capacity of the $4 billion board authorized plan, which runs through June 30, 2020. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $22 billion, which equated to 20.5% of our total assets. This is down from over 22% last year reflected in the deployment of our some of our liquidity to support growth. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. We expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I want to recap our current view for the fourth quarter and the year, as well as the impact from the Walmart program going forward now that the portfolio sale and conversion has been completed. Starting with the net interest margin, the margin is seasonally lower in the fourth quarter, declining as much as 50 basis points from the third to the fourth quarter in the past two years. In addition to seasonality, the decline will be somewhat more pronounced this quarter due to the excess liquidity from the sale of the Walmart portfolio. We expect the net interest margin to trend towards 15.5% for the fourth quarter. We still expect the net interest margin will be in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year. Focusing on RSAs. There are several factors impacting the RSA percent for the fourth quarter in the year. First, growth and improved program performance will impact RSAs. Also impacting RSAs is the sale of the Walmart portfolio, specifically both the timing of the portfolio sale, as well as the fact that the Walmart program operated an RSA percent below the company average will have an upward impact on the RSA percentage. Considering all these factors, we expect the RSA percent will be approximately 4.5% for the fourth quarter and for the full year it'll be slightly above the 4.0% to 4.2% range we had expected. Moving to credit. We expect the core reserve build for the fourth quarter to be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. As a result of the Walmart portfolio being sold in October, the remaining reduction in the loan loss reserve held against this portfolio will occur in the fourth quarter and will be in the $35 million to $40 million range. Regarding net charge-offs. We expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be towards the lower end of the 5.7% to 5.9%. The slight increase in net charge-offs for 2019 as compared to 2018 is mainly driven by the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in October. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate is expected to be similar to 2018. Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for 2019. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive risk-adjusted returns. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session.  We have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I have first question for Brian Wenzel. Just portfolio yield, it's obviously done really well despite the Fed rate cuts this quarter. And I know you indicated there was some purchase impact potentially. Could we just discuss about how the trend going forward relative to all these different dynamics occurring with the rates and, obviously, the mix changes? Great. Good morning, Sanjay. As you think about net interest margin for the quarter, a lot of our book – 45% of our book is floating. When you think about transactors, it's more like 25%. So we're not necessarily as exposed to interest rates. When you also think about the margin, we have a positive benefit from the purchase accounting last year for PayPal that's not reoccurring again this year, as well as the CIT that we put in place before we purchased the portfolio that's beginning to bleed in. So those are positive impacts on the portfolio as we move forward. Obviously, with Walmart coming out of the portfolio, there'll be a little bit of headwind to net interest margin, because that portfolio operated at a higher net interest margin than the overall book. So, again, being our assets and liabilities are fairly well matched, we don't see a lot of pressure from the interest rate environment as we move forward. Okay. And I guess my second question is for Margaret and Brian Doubles on the Synchrony Mastercard. I appreciate the disclosures there. Just wanted to make sure I understood sort of what the plan was going forward with that product. Going forward, is that product just going to be used for bankruptcy transitions for retailers, or are you expecting to grow that portfolio independently? And then, when we think about the success of that portfolio up until now, has it been consumers basically transitioning to that card as their primary card or have they been transferring balances over? Thank you. Yeah, sure, Sanjay. This is Brian. So, look, I'd say, overall we've been pleased with the trends and the performance that we're seeing on that Mastercard portfolio. It's still early, but we're seeing good activation, good usage. We're seeing nice retention of balances, good spend on the accounts. As you know, we put a very strong 2% cash back value proposition on the card. Given we're not paying the RSA, we're able to offer an attractive value prop and still earn a very attractive return. So, look, we're pleased with what we're seeing. In terms of a broader strategy, we're certainly evaluating that. We've got a great team in place. They've got a lot of general purpose card experience. Look, we're monitoring the usage, the performance on the portfolio. We also started to do some new account originations, so we're testing into different segments. But, look, I think the thing that's important to note is we're going to be very disciplined around profitability and returns on this. So, we have some modest growth expectations here in the short-term. Thank you. Yeah. And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Hi. Good morning. I had a question on the recent Venmo credit deal with PayPal. So, one of the elements of the Venmo modernization strategy for PayPal has been to enable Pay with Venmo checkout button for merchants that already accept PayPal and would like to accept Venmo. Is it reasonable to conclude that the Venmo credit product won't just act like a standalone credit card, but it will also be available digitally to Venmo customers who click on the Pay with Venmo checkout button? So basically, Venmo credit is going to be integrated across the Venmo platform? I would say that's probably a better question for the Venmo/PayPal team. But what I can tell you is that as we work with that organization, they're really looking at how do they expand customer choice and ability for their customers. So I would expect them to look at all avenues for growth for the use of the Venmo credit card. And we're going to work closely with them in terms of how we build out the capabilities, the digital experience, really trying to understand what are the customer frictions that are out there that we want to try to solve to really have what we're describing as a exclusive in-app great customer credit experience across various channels. So we're going to work closely with them as we continue to develop both the PayPal program that we have with them, as well as Venmo. Got it. Margaret, thanks. And are there any internal studies that you guys have done that give you any kind of sense of what the demand for the product would be like? It just seems like there are a lot of competing alternatives out there on the credit card side and so just wondering if it's reasonable for us to expect that the value prop will include rewards. And then just looking for a sense of what gives you guys confidence that the demand for the product will be there. Sure. Well, first, they have 40 million Venmo customers, so we think that's a great target market and it's growing. Secondly, it has a great brand and we know that, in particular, millennials really love Venmo. And so I think as we look to build out that value proposition, we're going to be looking at what are the type of rewards that those customers are looking for. So, it could include cash back, but I wouldn't say it's only going to be cash back. I think we really want to get into some deep research with that customer base. And then, the other piece of this is really, as we all know, these particular – or this particular segment of customers really look at experiences as a really important element of how they live and choose to live. And so, we're going to be looking at that both from a value prop perspective, as well as the experience they have themselves on using the app. That's great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. And thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Good morning. So, one question is on credit, it sounds like the guide for Q4 on the reserve build's fine. But if you look at the delinquencies year-over-year, ex PayPal, they're sort of flattish from down year-over-year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectation in the near term. And then, under the hood, what's going on with PayPal Credit in general. I guess, losses are going up just on growth and normalization. Can you just talk about those two factors? Great. Thanks, Don. First of all, we don't provide necessarily forward-looking guidance relative to delinquencies. They've been consistent and stable throughout 2019. With regard to PayPal, again, we don't provide specific information on one portfolio, but when you look at the guidance, we guided our net charge-off basis to the low-end of the 5.7% to 5.9% range. So as we move through the quarter, clearly we've seen stabilization to improving credit trends, which was why our reserve rate in the third quarter was below the guidance that we provided back in our second quarter call back in July. So, as we look at the net charge-off environment and credit environment, we're optimistic. We don't see any pressure on the consumer and all the measures that we look at in our collections really have performed. So, again, we view credit to be stabilizing the better and expect the net charge-off rate for the year to be at the low-end of 5.7% to 5.9% range, Don. And then the buybacks, they were a little bit light versus our model, but they kind of bounce around. I was just curious, do you still feel like you can buy back a significant amount in the open market? Are you still considering maybe a tender, or do you feel like you can just kind of work through that? And I would assume Q4 would be potentially heavier. Yeah. Obviously, as we move through the capital plan and the repurchase cadence for the year, there's a base capital plan or base repurchase plan that happens over the four or five quarters that we go out, and then we had the Walmart that kind of laid in. Obviously, we have to have certainty relative to that transaction. You have to record the reserves getting into earnings. We've purchased $1.3 billion approximately for the first two quarters under the plan. We have $2.7 billion remaining under the $4 billion authorized repurchase plan. We feel confident that we will be able to execute that plan. If you go back in our past history, we were able to execute twice, both the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year, repurchased in the open market of $966 million. So, we feel we have the execution to get to $2.7 billion done over the next three quarters. Certainly, we evaluate lots of different options to get the best execution on price and we'll continue to do that, but we feel confident we can execute on the plan that we outlined. Thank you. And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Couple of questions. One, just on the healthcare credit channel, I know you called out dental and veterinary, but I just wanted to understand a little bit more in some of the other verticals there, as well as plans to continue your dominance in that field. I see a lot of interest from other either FinTechies or financials coming after the area. So, if you could give us a sense of how you're pushing back against that competition. Thanks. Sure. So, we said since the beginning of the year, one of our strategies was really to grow the CareCredit platform. So, in the core business itself, we continue to see really good growth, and that's really the dental and vet businesses that we highlighted this quarter. But as we look to expand into more of what we're calling a health and wellness card, we've expanded the utility of the card over the year, the latest being the Walgreens acceptance, and we'll continue to look at those. But our other strategy is really in two areas. One is really shifting from what we're calling vets to pet. So, the acquisition of Pets Best this year is a function of that, and really looking at ways to leverage both the insurance side of settlement in our card product to really ensure that the consumers are getting a really efficient process going forward as they pay their vet bills. The other part of this is really going after what I call payment management systems, where we can integrate into those systems and have CareCredit as an option in that system. So, the Loyale example is one of those. And then lastly is really expanding into what we're calling health network, so hospital network. So, I think in the past we've described, we've gone out and sold dentist office by dentist office, vet office by vet office. We continue to look at various verticals where we think our card can be used and are now working with hospital networks to integrate CareCredit as a payment option in the hospital network. So, our view is we have a lot of expertise and experience in the space. We've been at it for over 30 years. And we think this is a great growth opportunity for us . While FinTechs are there, we see them. We're still very confident in our capabilities and what we've built out and where we want to go. Betsy, do you have anything further? Oh, yeah, sorry about that. Thanks so much. On RSAs, just separate question. I know you gave us a sense of 4Q and what the outlook is for that. Could you just give us a sense of how we should anticipate it projecting a little bit longer term. I'm just basically looking for ex-Walmart should the 4Q run rate be something that – seasonally it differs, obviously, but should that be a good run rate that we should take for the 2020 outlook or is there anything else that we should be considering in that? Great. Thanks, Betsy. We'll provide guidance on RSAs in our call in January encompassing full guidance for the year when we think about all the other elements. As you think about Walmart, Walmart did operate at a lower RSA percentage than the company average, which is why we see it slightly up in the fourth quarter versus past seasonal trends. Obviously that will impact us as we move forward into 2020, but we'll provide that guidance in January. Okay. Thanks. And thank you. Our next question... Thank you. We have our next question from Bill Ryan with Compass Point. Thank you and good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Also just in relation to the RSA, I know you're not providing 2020 guidance. But just as you kind of think about it structurally and directionally going into next year, do you expect it to be driven – you mentioned how Walmart's going to impact it. But looking at your contract renewals earlier this year, will they have any impact directionally in 2020 or given the economics of the renewals, is it pretty much the same and this has, call it, a nominal influence next year? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Bill, for the question. So you think about the RSA, when we renew transactions, the economic formula is kind of set at the store, so those formulas don't change as we move forward. So really what's going to drive the RSA as we move forward, absent the Walmart portfolio, is really going to be the underlying performance of the portfolio from growth from net interest margin, charge-offs, etcetera, that's going to be the bigger driver as we move forward. To the extent that we have improved performance on those lines, there will be more RSAs. To the extent it's going to be less, then the RSAs will decrease. So that's the benefit to us as a company, having that RSA buffer, but they participate in both sides. So, again, the contracts are generally set and won't change. It's really just the performance and growth of the underlying portfolios. Thank you. And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to talk about the general purpose a little bit. Historically, part of the value proposition on private label to the retailers is that you're providing their customers with spending money that they can use exclusively in their stores, and I assume that that's part of the sort of pitch to retailers. I'm curious as you sort of dip your toe into – and I don't want to overstate the general purpose proposition, but as you dip your toe in there, how you think that will resonate with your existing retail partners? Yeah, thanks, Rick. Look, we don't see it as a competing product. If you think about who we're in there competing against, they all have general purpose card portfolios that are much more substantial than what we have here. While we like this as a product and it does give us a nice diversification, it's pretty small today. We're in the very early innings here. There's a lot of positives. I think in terms of what we've rolled out, we like the trends that we're seeing on the new account originations that we've done so far. But, look, this is still a small piece of the overall portfolio. We're still a partner-led business. That'll remain the case for the foreseeable future. Okay, great. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. And thank you. We have our next question from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you're not providing any 2020 guidance yet, but I was hoping you could potentially give us a little bit more insights around the planning ahead of the CECL implementation. So  I know we know that's (00:44:48) 50% to 60% initial build, but maybe just kind of the knock-on effects or any following impacts as far as the ongoing provisioning needs and/or sort of capital level/buyback capability once we get through the remaining $2.7 billion on the current authorization. Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks. Yeah, great. First, with regard to CECL, again, we indicated on the call earlier that our expectation now is consistent with the second quarter and the range we provided back then. As we think about the ultimate amount that will get posted at the end of the year, that's really going to depend upon the asset composition, the economy, and our kind of view of that economy as it moves forward. So there are some moving pieces and as well as we're finalizing some of the assumptions. So it's a little bit premature to talk about the CECL impact. As well, there's going to be an RSA offset, not for the day one, transition adjustment for day two, we're still working through that with our partners. So, as we finalize that here in the fourth quarter, we'll provide comprehensive guidance with regard to that in January. With regard to second part of your question with how CECL will impact capital, first, I'd say, again, it does not impact our capital plan that runs through June 30, 2020. We incorporated our view of that with our submission to the regulators back in the first quarter. So from the  first plan (00:46:16) perspective, it's already addressed. As we think about CECL and the post-up of the incremental reserves, we obviously have been in contact and discussing with the regulators and stakeholders the fact that we should be getting capital credit for the post-up of those reserves as we move forward. And we're in ongoing dialogues on how that should occur. So it's a little bit premature to talk about that relative to future capital plans, but we plan to incorporate it as we move forward and we'll give guidance when we have greater clarity. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks. And you kind of front ran my follow-up, which was going to be around the discrete contracts and the RSA structure. With respect to CECL, it sounds like that will require kind of a discussion at least with some, if not all, of the main partners. Is that safe to say? Yeah. Obviously, we're in discussions with them; first of all, educating them on the CECL standard, make sure they understand it, and as we finalize our adjustment how that impacts and flows through the RSA structures. Again, I think we've said in the past the day one transition adjustment, there'll be no impact from an RSA perspective, being it does not go through the P&L. But as we move to day two, we're going through and really working with the partners, explaining the implications to them, and then we'll come back with – again, in January with the complete guidance with how it impacts RSA as well as the provision line. All right, great. Thanks. We'll wait till then. Thank you. And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. When we just think about the general purpose card initiatives, and given your efficiency has been pretty stable for quite some time, should we expect some of the initiatives for general purpose build out, if there is any, to pressure the efficiency ratio as we look forward in any way, or is this so small and part of your kind of normal investment build when you think about it moving forward anyway that it shouldn't have any material impact on your efficiency ratio moving forward? Yeah, I don't think in the short term certainly you're going to see this pressure the efficiency ratio at all. I think, just going back to one important thing I said earlier, we're testing into new account originations. We're testing into different customer segments, different APRs, et cetera. But it's very important to note that we're going to be very disciplined around profitability and returns. So we're being very disciplined here in the short term. As we run new tests, we're trying to find those cells where we can – one, where we can compete. It's obviously a very competitive market. We're trying to find those areas where we can compete, but still  earn a (49:15) very attractive return. So that's our primary focus here. Yeah, sounds like a great runway for expansion. And then just separately, can you talk about the Retail Card segment exposure to home improvement outside of Lowe's when you think about the total Retail Card NII and fees? And then we've seen a spike in mortgage applications. Can you talk about what you've seen in the past, even pre-IPO of your spending trends, as mortgage applications ramp? It seems like there's a really good opportunity that's unique to Synchrony right now unfolding, where you may see some accelerated NII growth in the future due to some of this home improvement possible ramp from mortgage applications. Could you just talk about the pre-IPO trends you've seen and some  (00:50:01)... Sure. So I would say that, obviously, we have Lowe's, which is a big retail related to the home, but our Payment Solutions business is really where the verticals are really dedicated to a lot of the home, particularly furniture, home improvement, HVAC, all those types of things. And I think you've seen us talk about the fact that home has definitely helped us, I would say, over the last probably 18 months. And we're seeing people invest in their home, so we're seeing that on the Payment Solutions side, for sure, and in loans. I think the other thing we did this year is we launched the HOME network, which is a card that allows you to purchase in a number of our retail partners and others. It's a network card particularly dedicated to purchasing a home, which – the launch was very good. We're continuing to invest in that network. So, to your point, we see the home as a critical element of growth as we look forward in this business and feel that we have a number of merchants across the system that are particularly dedicated to that vertical. So, definitely a nice opportunity for us as we see home purchasing increase and home improvement being a big part of that. Excellent. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Thanks very much. Maybe just getting back to the PayPal/Venmo relationship. One phenomenon that I'm sure you guys have also noticed is the growing use of buy now, pay later functionality, which in many ways is similar to what you do on promotional finance. So I'm wondering if there's any discussion that you're having about maybe integrating those functionalities and capabilities into your relationship with PayPal. So we actually have a product out there already called SetPay  that we (00:52:09) tested and piloted in the market that is a product like that. What I would say is from our PayPal and Venmo perspective, first of all, they're obviously a very customer-focused, digitally focused organization, and I would say they look at all opportunities as a way to grow their business, which is a benefit to us growing our business. So, we're in talks with them on a bunch of different things, both on the PayPal side – I like to remind everyone, we only converted PayPal in June. So just on the pure PayPal side, we have a list of initiatives that we want to work on and execute on, particularly from a growth marketing, product design perspective going forward. And now we have the added opportunity of Venmo. So, I would say the teams are looking at all different types of ways to really leverage the opportunity that's out there in the marketplace and really make sure we have the right offer for the right product in front of the customer as they're making their purchases, and that would all be in-app and digital. Thanks. And if I can just follow-up, and I know there's been a series of questions already. But just respect to the general purpose product that you're experimenting with, maybe just at a high level, what is the thesis there that you're pursuing, given as, I think, others have pointed out, it's a reasonably crowded marketplace, particularly in cash back, where there has been an acceleration towards the 2% level and such, but as Apple Card and others kind of demonstrate, in and of itself that's not really driving consumers to adoption. Yeah, look, first I'd say, this is a very close adjacency to what we do today and our core business. We have very experienced underwriting credit teams, very experienced marketing teams. We have had a Dual Card product, which is a top of wallet general purpose card-like product, for years. So this is a space we actually know really well. We actually have a great team in place that has a lot of general purpose card expertise. And this is – part of strategy is merging kind of practical reality with future long-term objectives. And when we had the opportunity to convert the Toys\"R\"Us portfolio, that was a great way to kind of maintain utility for those cardholders, give them an attractive value proposition. And has, frankly, provided us with a great test bed now to kind of learn and see how we want to enter into the space. It's been on our strategic roadmap for years. I think the conversion allowed us to accelerate that and we're pretty excited, but we're also cautious. We're not confused that this is a very competitive market. We're very focused on targeting profitable accounts that have a good risk-adjusted return. And so I would say our growth expectations in the short term are modest, but we're excited about getting some nice diversification. But laser-like focused on maintaining our return profile as well. Thanks very much. And thank you. Our last question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But picking up on your comments, Margaret, on PayPal Credit, could you talk a little bit about maybe the priorities as you go forward? Because it is really – I mean, it's sort of greenfield in terms of allowing you kind of the ability to access retailers, either deeper penetrate retailers that are your partners or retailers that aren't. And maybe how we should think about the opportunities and how you're going to prioritize them> Yeah. I think the opportunities are in a couple of key areas. One is just pure marketing. In the past, we were kind of on the PayPal side competing, because they had their product, we had our product. So I think from a merge of how we're kind of targeting customers, I think that's a real opportunity. The second thing that I think has been – and has proven to be very beneficial is the sharing of data on both sides, meaning we have a lot of information, they have a lot of information. So how do we leverage that information both from a growth perspective, which I think is the most exciting part, but then also making sure from an underwriting perspective, we're making the right decision. And, more importantly is protecting on the fraud side. So we see lots of opportunity just be, what I would say, more efficient on the marketing side, and then more robust on the credit underwriting and protecting the consumer. I think we're still in early days as we've laid out the conversion, which was, as you know, a big one. We have a bunch of, what I would call, technological advances that we're going to make together that we're really driving. And that's really going to be more around the customer and merchant experience, really trying to make that as seamless as possible. And ensure that that customer never leaves the PayPal app, if you will, and it's all done within the app. And so, we have teams of people, and I mean team working on a bunch of initiatives to really drive all of that. And it's all around, what I would say, two key things, growth and experience, both on the consumer side and the merchant side, which is very important here, for PayPal. Great, thanks. And kind of in a similar vein, you talked a little bit about some of the healthcare and pet-type networks. Is there any thought given to kind of just – kind of talking about these in terms of the networks that you've kind of built yourself as a vertical that you would give disclosure on? Because I think one of the things that I heard during the call was this idea that there's some concern about incursion by FinTechs, and it sort of seems like the opposite that you have the ability to build those networks. And so whether that's something you think about kind of outlining in greater detail. Yeah, that's something we'll probably look at as we talk about the strategy for 2020 going forward. But generally speaking, we have – first of all, I would say the space itself is fairly fragmented, right? So, one of the advantages we have is just the fact that we've created a brand name for ourselves and are recognized by a lot of folks in that space. But we're still – again, honestly, I would say we're still learning particularly on the big hospital network side. Each of these networks operate very differently. And I think you know that we brought on our board an expert in this area, who's helping us think through how to target and where to go after. So we'll talk more about that as we go into 2020. Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q3 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please, go ahead. Thank you, Allen, and thank you, all, for joining today's call. As a reminder before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's slides and on our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior period we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to the Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Rosie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our release earlier today, our third quarter results are a continuation of the consistent steady performance we've been delivering over the last few years. We had strong FX-adjusted revenue growth of 9% in the quarter, and our EPS of $2.08 was 11% higher than last year. The consistently high levels of revenue growth we're delivering is the result of the focused approach we've taken in executing our strategy and the strength of our differentiated business model. This was the ninth straight quarter where FX-adjusted revenue growth was 8% or higher. I'm especially pleased that our revenue growth continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of spend, loans and fees. Card fee revenues were particularly strong, growing 19% and exceeding $1 billion this quarter for the first time. Nearly 70% of the cards we've acquired this year are fee-based products, providing us recurring subscription-like revenues. The trends we saw in the business remain consistent with an economy that continues to expand, albeit at a more modest pace than last year. Our FX-adjusted proprietary billings grew 7%, led by strong growth in our US and International Consumer businesses. We continued to deliver healthy loan growth and our credit performance remained at industry-leading levels; in fact, better than the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. So, as you can see, even with some uncertainty in the global economic and political environment, our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance is enabling us to deliver steady solid results. With that in mind, I'd like to discuss our progress on the three company-wide initiatives I laid out at Investor Day. As a reminder, these cut across all of our strategic imperatives. They are focusing on our customer as a platform for growth, expanding and leveraging our network of strategic partners, and prioritizing our investments in international to drive growth. Let's start with customers as a platform for growth. Our global diverse customer base has become a major source of growth for us. One of the ways we're deepening relationships with existing customers is through the disciplined strategic approach we've taken to continuously refresh our products. These refreshes are not just cosmetic changes. We're redefining membership by adding innovative, experiential and rational value that our customers respond well to, and we're pricing for that additional value. In the third quarter, we continued the refresh of our Platinum Card portfolio across several international markets, and we're following a similar playbook with our Gold Cards. Now, we're updating our iconic Green Card. A few weeks ago, we introduced a new Ocean Plastic design. And later this month, we will announce an array of changes to the product, including new benefits, broader payment flexibility and a digital focus. And just yesterday, we announced the major refresh of our Corporate Card program, which includes a number of new features, including newer enhanced benefits with Uber, Hilton and Clear, which is the biometric identification system that expedites the airport security process. As part of that announcement, we introduced an extension of our Corporate Card program designed to meet the needs of start-ups, with features that include corporate liability and dynamic spending capacity. As I've said on prior occasions, we typically see a significant increase in spending when our customers add an additional Amex product to their wallets, and our corporate Card Members represent a great opportunity here. For many of our customers, the Corporate Card is their first American Express product. To encourage them to add a personal card, we're creating ways to provide benefits for carrying both, such as a new product that offers an incentive for Corporate Card members to obtain one of our select consumer cards. These initiatives are proving to be a terrific platform for growth. We're seeing a lift in spending and engagement on our refresh products. Over 60% of our total loan growth is coming from existing Card Members. And we're earning a steady stream of revenues as more customers move to fee-based products, which are priced for the additional value we're delivering. Our customers have also become one of the best and most efficient ways to bring new Card Members into the franchise. Through our Member-Get-Member referral program, we've acquired over 250,000 new customers this year so far. In addition, successful referrals have increased 35% compared to last year's third quarter. Turning to partnerships, the third quarter continue to demonstrate the benefits of our powerful network of partners who help us deliver enhanced value across the enterprise. As I've said before, partnerships are essential to each of our strategic imperatives and they take many forms, from the over 50 co-brand relationships we have around the world, to our recent digital partnerships, to expanding our merchant network. When we talk about partnerships, we have to start with Delta, our largest, deepest and longest-running relationship. At the end of September, we announced seven refreshed Delta Sky Miles co-brand cards as part of our renewed 11-year agreement with the airline. The new cards, which will be available in January in the US, will feature a range of customized travel benefits for both consumers and small business Card Members. Also in the third quarter, we launched a new small business credit card in the UK with British Airways, and one in Singapore with Singapore Airlines. And we announced refreshed consumer cards in Canada with Air Miles and Scotiabank. In addition to co-brands, we've been expanding our digital partnerships. Earlier this week, we announced two new offerings with PayPal and Venmo for US consumer Card Members. First is the ability to pay for purchases made through PayPal with Membership Rewards points. And we're also introducing split the bill functionality within the Amex mobile app. On the merchant side, with the help of our OptBlue partnerships, we remain on track to achieve virtual parity coverage in the US by the end of the year. In International, our strategy of selectively increasing our investments to drive share, scale and relevance through a country-by-country approach is delivering strong results. Despite political and economic uncertainty in some regions, international remains the highest growth area of our business. Third quarter results showed continued strong growth across both consumer and small business segments, driven by results on our top strategic countries, where we've allocated incremental investments. Since the beginning of the year, we've launched 18 new refreshed proprietary cards, three co-brand cards, and 30 network cards across International. As a result, we're taking share and generating strong billings growth in most of our proprietary countries, with overall FX-adjusted consumer proprietary billings up 14% in the quarter and FX-adjusted SME billings up 18%. And finally, we're making good progress on expanding merchant coverage which is key to our overall International growth strategy. As you can see, we've made a lot of progress in each of our three priority areas since March, and there's more to come. In summary, I feel very good about our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. As we look ahead, I expect the consistent trends we've seen to continue into Q4, translating into revenue growth of 8% to 10% in the quarter. And we're reaffirming our full-year guidance of adjusted EPS between $7.85 and $8.35. Our performance reinforces my confidence in our ability in today's environment to sustain high levels of revenue growth and consistent double-digit EPS growth which creates value for our shareholders. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff. Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about yet another solid quarter of steady and consistent performance. Let's get right to our summary of financials on slide 3. Third quarter revenues of $11 billion grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, with this growth driven again by a well-balanced mix of spend, lend and fee revenues. You continue to see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and FX-adjusted adjusted revenue growth of 9%. Although the US dollar has strengthened recently, the spread between our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth has lessened slightly relative to Q2. As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the US dollar began in the third quarter of last year. Assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the fourth quarter 2019. Our strong top line revenue performance drove net income of $1.8 billion, up 6% from a year ago. And earnings per share was $2.08, representing EPS growth of 11% in the third quarter. This EPS growth was supported by the 4% reduction in our share count, enabled by our continued prudent management of the capital-generating capabilities of our business model as we returned $5.5 billion in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last four quarters. Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on slides 4 through 6. Starting on slide 4, our FX-adjusted total billings growth for the third quarter was 6%. We think it is important, though, to continue to break out the billings growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we exit our network business in Europe and Australia. We expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in 2020. Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings, which comes from our network business GNS, was down 2% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Turning to our proprietary billed business growth on slide 5, the trends this quarter continue to be consistent with the economic tone. The US Consumer continues to show solid growth with even some modest acceleration as we have gone through 2019. The International Consumer shows even higher levels of growth. And our Commercial customers are lapping a particularly strong 2018, with spending trends that have diverged a bit from the Consumer segment. You see this as you turn to slide 6. We first spoke last quarter about potential signs of caution in commercial spending trends relative to the strong and steady growth we see in Consumer. Over the last few months, the headlines and macro data would suggest that these trends continue, particularly among the larger corporations within our customer base. We see these dynamics in our large and global corporate card trends where we had a 1% decline in billed business on an FX-adjusted basis in the third quarter. So, adjusting for the reduction in spending from just two large customers where we saw some client-specific decreases, the growth rate would have been a bit above 1% this quarter. In contrast, spending from our US small and mid-sized enterprise Card Members, or SMEs, grew a solid 6% in the third quarter, with importantly relatively stable growth throughout the three months of the quarter. We continue to feel great about the long-term opportunities with both of these customer types. And as Steve highlighted a few minutes ago, we are making investments that leverage our strong leadership position and differentiated business models to take advantage of these opportunities. International SME remains our highest growing customer type, with 18% FX-adjusted billings growth in the third quarter. Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we believe we have a long runway to sustain this strong growth. Moving to US Consumer, which made up 33% of the company's billings in the third quarter, billings were up 8%. And taking the number out a decimal, actually a bit stronger than Q1 and Q2. This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers. These trends also highlight the continued strength of the consumer in the US. Moving to the right, International Consumer growth remained in the teens at 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key markets despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While growth in Australia and Mexico moderated to the high-single digits this quarter, we continued to see strong growth of 19% in both the UK and Japan, as well as double-digit growth in our top markets across the EU, all on an FX-adjusted basis. Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down on these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall then, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate. Turning next to loan performance on slide 7. Total loan growth was 9% in the third quarter, with over 60% of that growth again coming from our existing customers. We feel good about our lending strategy, which is focused on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers' borrowing. We believe we have a long runway to continue this strategy. Moving to the right-hand side of slide 7, net interest yield was 11.1% in the third quarter, up 30 basis points relative to the prior year, reflecting continued positive impacts from mix and pricing risk. We remain focused on optimizing our lending capabilities and pricing constructs, and we have seen lower loan balances on promotional offers as we have shifted towards more premium products. The combination of loan growth and yield increases are contributing to the 12% growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter. Slide 8 then shows the credit implications of our strategy. As you can see, the trends on both write-off rates and delinquencies continued to be stable and benign, reflecting in part the low unemployment rate and relatively stable economy. We see these trends across both our Consumer and Commercial segments. The GCP net loss ratio remains lower than last year. And as you see in the tables that accompany our earnings release, both consumer and small business credit trends also remain steady. These trends lead to the same conclusion we have reached in each quarter so far this year. We do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing much better than we expected at the beginning of the year. This brings us to provision expense. In the third quarter, provision expense growth was 8%, reflecting the greater stability in our credit trends that began in the second half 2018. Clearly, as we've gone through the year, credit performance for us as well as for others in the industry has been better than expected. That's what we saw again in the third quarter. And as a result, we now expect full-year provision growth of around 10%. While we are on the subject of provision, though, let me take a few minutes to talk about CECL. We are making good progress on our efforts to prepare for implementation on January 1 of 2020. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL today, our current total reserves of $2.8 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve given the extremely short life of a charge receivable. Stepping back, there are three important takeaways on CECL that I would like to leave you with. First, we believe that the capital impact of the onetime implementation increase in reserves will likely be very manageable given our strong balance sheet, 30%-plus ROE and spend-centric model. Second, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. Although the ultimate impact will be heavily dependent on many factors, we will likely have higher provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology as we continue to grow our loan book. Since we are currently finalizing our CECL models and working on our 2020 plan, we'll provide more color on the expected 2020 impact from CECL on next quarter's call. Finally, CECL is merely an accounting-driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk profile, or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios. Given this as well as our strategy of investing for growth, we do not intend to change our investment plans because of the impact CECL will have on provision expense growth in 2020. Now, let's get back to our results, and turn to the strong revenue growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis that you see on slide 10. The consistent execution of our strategies and our focus on investing in share, scale and relevance has driven top line revenue growth of 8% or more for over two years. This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019. And despite the modest sequential deceleration in volume growth we saw this quarter, our revenue growth of 9.4% in the third quarter was relatively flat to the 9.6% growth we delivered last quarter. This revenue growth was again driven by broad-based growth across spend, lend and fee revenues as you can see on slide 11. And importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from spend and fee revenues remained at 80% in the third quarter, in line with both recent history and a much longer view of our history. Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fee growth accelerated to 19%, and as Steve said, surpassed $1 billion in the third quarter for the first time. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment and our unique value propositions that Steve also talked about in his opening remarks. We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when they choose to pay these subscription-like fees. And as Steve mentioned earlier but I think it bears repeating, we continue to see that the majority of our new Card Members, around 70% so far this year, are choosing our fee-based products as well. Going forward, we feel good about our ability to maintain strong growth in these membership revenues given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and across customer segments. Net interest income grew at 12% in the third quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I just mentioned a few moments ago. So, let's come back now to the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue on slide 12. On the right, you see that discount revenue grew at 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with the last two quarters, making this the eighth consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue, not the average discount rate, is working. Moving on now to the things we are investing in to drive our strong revenue growth. Let's start with our customer engagement costs, which you can see on slide 13 were $5 billion in the third quarter, up 11% versus last year. Starting at the bottom, marketing and business development costs were up 11% in the third quarter and were in line with Q2. Remember that this line has two components: our traditional marketing and promotion expenses; and then, payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks, and co-brand partners. Also, remember that this is the second quarter where we are seeing the impact of our renewed agreement with Delta, which increased our marketing and business development costs by $200 million relative to our original outlook for the full-year. Continuing on to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year, a bit higher than our billing trends given our evolving value propositions. Moving then to the top of the slide, Card Member services costs were up 22% in the third quarter. We continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions , such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and helps support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products. Moving on then to operating expenses on slide 14, we saw a 5% increase in the third quarter, consistent with our long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. I would offer two comments here. First, as I mentioned last quarter, some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth – growth in sales force, premium servicing, digital capabilities – these will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years. Second, as a reminder, through our AMEX Ventures Group, we have a strategic investment portfolio of over 40 investments. This quarter's OpEx included a net benefit of roughly $0.05 related to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our strategic investment portfolio, which is somewhat higher than the benefit we saw last year. Altogether, I would just sum up by saying that we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to grow our operating expenses more slowly than our revenues. Turning to capital on slide 15, our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11%, at the top end of our 10% to 11% target range. And we returned $1.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we've said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plan. We've historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders, and we will continue with that philosophy going forward. So, that brings us to our outlook, and then we'll open the call for your question. With each quarter of this year, we've demonstrated consistent progress against our objectives of delivering high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. Now, looking ahead, given today's economic environment, we see a long runway to sustain this performance. In the near-term, to give you a bit more color on the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to continue at the strong levels we have seen and to be within our 8% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. And if FX rates stay where they are, the headwind from the strong dollar should lessen in the fourth quarter. We expect the stability we have seen in our credit trends to continue, with full-year provision growth of around 10%. And given the consistent operating performance trends we have seen throughout the first three quarters of the year, we expect our Q4 EPS results will be very much in line with our year-to-date results, excluding the $0.05 mark-to-market benefit on our investment portfolio that we saw in the third quarter and, of course any other contingencies that may occur in the fourth quarter. Which will bring us to reaffirm our adjusted earnings guidance of $7.85 to $8.35 for the full-year. In addition, we are working towards having a 2020 plan, showing high revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth off of the middle part of our 2019 EPS guidance range. Of course, this assumes we do not see a material deterioration in the economic environment versus where we are today; and given my earlier comments around CECL, it does not factor in any potential impacts from CECL in 2020. To close, our year-to-date performance and expectations for the full-year demonstrate consistent execution against our strategies, as well as the financial growth algorithm I shared with you at our last Investor Day. We remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth, and in today's environment, double-digit EPS growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rosie. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator? Our first question will come from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please. Yeah, good morning. Thanks. Hi. I had a question on net card fees that – basically, what I'm trying to get at is you showed some acceleration in net card fee growth. Cards in the US, basic cards-in-force has been largely range-bound throughout the year. So, can net card fees continue to accelerate if cards remains somewhat flattish? And should card growth in the US accelerate again, or how should we think about that? Craig, as you recall, we tend to discourage people a little bit from looking at that gross cards-in-force number. Because what's really important here is the quality of the cards you have and the quality of the cards you're bringing in. Both Steve and I talked about the fact that 70% of the new Card Members we're bringing in are on fee-based products. We've talked about for a couple quarters now about bringing in, in general, a more premium-oriented mix of Card Members. And that cards-in-force number is also influenced by our periodic efforts, frankly, to go back and cancel some inactive Card Members. So, we feel tremendously strong about the breadth of the products that are driving card fee growth and think there's a long runway to continue. Yeah. And I think, just to add one other point, I think the other thing that is really important is the recent strategy of consistently refreshing our products is critically important to not only growing card fees, but it's also what we've seen is we see an uptick in spending even from existing cardholders. So, again, I think the number is a little bit deceptive because you've got a clean-out and you also have a switch. You've got a lot of upgrades in there as well. So, we feel really confident about the strategy we're on. We'll next go to the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Go ahead, please. Thank you, and good morning. A question on your B2B payment strategy. You acquired acompay during the quarter. It does automated AP. You have a lot of different partnerships there. And it's an area that the massive market TAM, it could move the needle, I would think, for American Express. Can you update your thoughts on your investments in the B2B payment space and AP and AR automation? And if that can move the needle materially for Amex over the long-term? Yeah, I think, look, Bob, I think as we've and we've said this at Investor Day as well, our belief is this is a long-term opportunity. Having said that, we've entered into partnerships with people like bill.com at the real small end of the market, we've done MineralTree and WEX in sort of mid space. We've done Tradeshift. We've done Ariba. We have now an investment in  ACON (00:32:29) to help sort of automate those processes. But one thing I will point out is, while it is a long-term play, most of our spending in an SME segment today is B2B spending, and that continues to grow. So, we feel really confident about what we're doing. But as I've said before, the integration in sort of procurement process, it's a tough integration and it takes time. And that's why we do these partnerships, that's why we make these investments, and that's why we still believe it's a long-term play. But we are seeing value just from a B2B perspective, especially in SME where the majority of our spending is B2B, not T&E. Our next question we'll go to the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to sort of delve into the divergence between acceleration of billed business on an account basis at the consumer level and a deceleration on the Commercial business. Historically, has that provided any signal that we should be paying attention to? No, not necessarily. I think if you look at the last recession, you would have seen sort of the reverse. You would have seen Consumer coming down first, and then Commercial. So, I don't think that is a signal at all. As Jeff pointed out, our Consumer business has grown slightly in the US quarter-over-quarter. Really strong across all segments as it relates to International, whether it's SME or whether it's Consumer. Mid-teen, double-digit growth. Let me comment on where you may be seeing some softness as we look at the numbers. You're seeing a 1% decline as it relates to global. A couple of adjustments in there, with maybe some jet fuel or things like that. But you also have to realize we're coming off a high. It was almost 10% growth in the third quarter of last year. So, to me, that's almost stable. And when I think about large and global, having been involved with this for a really long time, I'm pretty comfortable about that. When you look at SME in the US and we're about 6% up year-over-year, again off of a double-digit high, you've got to delve into it. And when we look at it, we look at sort of three components of that billing. We look at are we continuing to acquire, and that is been steady for us; are we losing accounts either from a competitive perspective or from the perspective of losses, accounts that just go out of business, and that has been steady. Where we're seeing sort of a softening a little bit is in the organic spend. If you think about it from a retail perspective, you would think of same store sales. But even that, again, we came off a high in the third quarter of last year, and that's still a positive trend. So, what would concern me is that if that same account spending had gone down. It is not. It is still in positive territory, albeit not in the same sort of significant growth that we saw. And to be honest, that was growth that we had not seen before. So, the sustainability of that was questionable in our minds anyway. And so, we feel pretty good about it. And again, as Jeff mentioned the credit quality, credit quality is still pristine. We'll next go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead, please. Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on your fee-based products. Some innovative fintech players like Square are enjoying some success in targeting the unbanked and underbanked customer segment, for example, with their Cash App and goal of getting customers to use it as their primary bank account through direct deposit. You guys were well ahead of this trend years ago when you identified an opportunity to generate fee-based income in the segment with products like Bluebird and Serve. Can you give us some general color on how you guys are thinking about those products today? Do you still see the growth opportunity there as attractive? How focused are you on growing those products? Is continued innovation and enhancement of the underlying app something that you guys are investing in? And just in general, are you seeing some customers use Bluebird and Serve for direct deposit? Thanks. We're not focused on it at all. In fact, we sold that last year to InComm. That's not a segment that we see as an opportunity for us. We took a run at it. And the theory of the case was that you would be able to upgrade those customers into our product, into our traditional product set. The reality is, that was a bridge too far to cross. And so, we sold off that portfolio of Bluebird, of Serve, and the gift cards to InComm last year. And I think InComm is really happy with that transaction, and we're really happy with that transaction. We do not see that as a growth opportunity for us at all. Our next question will be from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Great. Thanks. Recognizing that credit, no sign of deterioration, in fact actually has probably improved over the course of the year. Any sense as to how to think about just the impact of CECL on ongoing provisions relative to that kind of 50-ish percent increase on the credit piece as we think about the growth of provisions into next year? Yeah. Obviously, Moshe, that's a very fair question. We're still not ready to quantify. I do think this range we've given for the onetime impact, you can sort of do some back of the envelope math off of that. But there are so many complex pieces to CECL. Obviously, CECL will also require us to incorporate into our accounting provision forward-looking economic forecasts amongst the over 100 other variables that will be part of the 150-plus customer segments and models that drive this. So, directionally, I am very comfortable saying there is some – given our levels of growth, some higher provision expense you would expect in a normal economic environment under CECL. I am just not ready to give an exact number. I really want to emphasize though what I said in my earlier remarks, which are that from our perspective, this is pure accounting-driven acceleration of losses that ultimately would have run through our financial statements anyway. It has zero impact on real economics. It has zero impact on our view of risk. And that is why, as we think about 2020, we think we are going to make a series of decisions about what we're willing and what we think is prudent to invest in continuing to drive the business for the long-ter. And then, we'll let the CECL changes to the provision fall where they will. We'll go now to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Hi, Betsy. Okay. So, I just wanted to dig in a little bit, Steve, to the comment that you were making earlier around the opportunity to penetrate your corporate card customers with personal card. And the reason I ask the question is I would have thought this was something that was well done and already was maxed out. But your comments suggest it's not. So, what I wanted to understand is this, is the go-to-market strategy different, and what kind of opportunity set you could get? And then, Jeff, if you could just reiterate the mark-to-market benefit that you had and where we're supposed to strip that out. I'm getting a couple questions in on exactly where we're supposed to strip that $0.05 out of. Thanks. Yeah, the reality is we really have not focused on penetrating our corporate card base with our personal cards for pretty much forever. We did some test last year. Part of it was a reluctance with our corporate card customers for us to access the base, but the tide has changed. We've had companies come to us and ask us as they look to bring more value to their employees, can we do that? And so, this is a welcome opportunity for us. So, I would say it is absolutely new territory for us. So, it's not been maxed out at all. That's not to say that our corporate cardholders do not have personal cards, but it is to say that we've never utilized our corporate card distribution opportunities within the corporate card companies that have our corporate card. So, we're excited about the opportunity, and think that it's going to provide another opportunity to lift our overall cards. And on the mark-to-market, Betsy, I'll make two points. Just to remind everyone, beginning last January, we and all companies began to have to mark-to-market various investments. For us, that really means the 40 or so investments we have through our AMEX Ventures fund. In general, those marks have not been material. This quarter, they were a little bit more material. They netted to about $0.05 positive. We see that as an ongoing part of our business. My only reference to the $0.05 in terms of, to use your phrase, Betsy, not mine, stripping out, was that when I talked about Q4, I made the observation that we feel really good about the consistent operating performance of the company. And we expect Q4 to look very similar to the first three quarters. So, as you think about the pure operating performance of the company in the first three quarters, in Q1, I'd take the merchant litigation charge out, so that puts you at $2 a share. In Q2, it's $2.07 a share. And again, going back to this operating performance concept in Q3, that takes it to the about $2.03 level. That's the only context in which I was trying to bring up the $0.05. Thank you for the question. We'll move on to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead. Yeah, thanks. I don't imagine you've gotten this question in a while, just given how strong your revenue growth has been, and it sounds like you're pretty confident in the outlook for 2020 as well around revenue growth. But I have been getting some questions from investors asking how much room you guys have to control and further growth of OpEx should revenue growth. So, Steve, I guess is the guy who is responsible for getting those OpEx under control when revenue was weak. I'd be interested in hearing your commentary and thoughts there. Yeah. I mean, look, I think if you look at sort of how we've controlled OpEx over the last eight years, I think it was an aggregate growth of probably about 6% or so. As we look at it, as we've sort of changed philosophy a little bit to look at high revenue growth, it made sense to not walk away from some of these OpEx opportunities that we had. As Jeff said, I don't think this is a consistent playbook that we're going to run. But I have all the confidence in the world in our ability to control OpEx. We're still providing operating leverage when you think about sort of  9% to 5% (00:44:20) here, which is what we've done. The problem is, when you're growing revenue at 4% and you're growing revenue at 5%, if you want that leverage, you've got to grow OpEx at about 1%. So, the delta is relatively similar to what we've been doing. And we'll be looking at good investment opportunities. But you're right. I was known as the OpEx guy here for a lot of years, and still am. I still drive people crazy about it, and I will continue to do that. But we're not going to make any foolish decisions, and I believe that we still have operating leverage opportunities as it relates to OpEx and revenue. We have a question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead. David, are you there? David? Please check your mute feature on your phone. All right. We will move on to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Hi. Good morning. I had a question about marketing spend, because if I think about this year and even last year, you had some elevated marketing spend with the brand refresh in 2018 that spilled into 2019, and then you had the Delta agreement which also led to the $200 million of elevated spending. And then you got all these product refreshes. I'm just wondering as we think about 2020, do you come up against some easier comps on spending, or are there things in the pipeline that will likely absorb marketing spend in 2020? Just thinking about how to compare 2020 to 2019. Yeah, in many ways, Chris, I think the examples you cite are a wonderful illustration of why a few years ago, we began to encourage people to focus on broadly what we call our customer engagement costs, right, because we pull different levers at different times in the rewards category or, to your point, in the traditional marketing category around brand spending or – in spending we do in the payments department – partner area with Delta and at other times we choose to put resources into card member services. So the trends in any one of those lines may vary a little bit from year-to-year or from quarter-to-quarter. The broad group of all of them, however, is what we're using to drive high levels of revenue growth, and we've been very consistent for some years now, Chris, in saying we do expect that collectively, those costs are going to grow a little bit faster than revenue, but that's what's going to enable us to drive in today's environment 8% to 10% revenue growth. It's why the OpEx leverage Steve just talked about is so important to help mitigate that margin compression you get from customer engagement because OpEx will grow more slowly than our revenues. You combine that with our strong balance sheet, and that's how we have a model that is consistently producing double-digit EPS. Our next question will be from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please. Hey. Thanks so much for taking my question. Look, the diversity of the revenue growth is really strong for sure, and I think one thing that is taking some investors by surprise is not only the fee for card or the NIM expanding this quarter, but to some extent, but really the discount rate has been on quite a nice trajectory. And I know that you talked about not managing to the discount rate, but your strategy has shown at least over the last number of quarters that the discount rate is moving up as well, and that's a nice benefit as well. Can you just talk about what you've lapped and what's going into the discount rate expanding just as a natural piece of the puzzle here? Thanks so much. Yes, and as you know, and I always say this, I really don't focus on the discount rate all that much. Yeah, it's been consistent. It's a little bit up. But I think you've got a couple things going on. I mean, you have got – there's some strategic renegotiations that we lapped, there was activity in Europe, there was activity in Australia. In any given quarter, there's a mix of business, and so all those things contribute. What I really focus in on is the consistent discount revenue growth. And if you want to project this out, the reality is, is that, as you expand into B2B, you're not going to have the same kind of discount rate in B2B, but again, there what I like to focus on is what the margin is, right? And so, if you look at a lower discount rate, you'll also look at lower rewards cost and things like that. And so, ultimately what we really focused in is the margin between the discount rate and the cost that go along with those billings. But we're really pleased with the way discount revenue has gone. And when all the numbers come in, the discount rate is flattish to up. And that's okay, too. We'll go to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna for your question. Go ahead, please. Hi. Congrats on the numbers, guys. I just wanted to ask, Jeff, with regard to the GNS, slide 6, up 3% adjusted, I think you made your – in your prepared remarks, you said that we were lapping that in 2020, might be – this might be over, meaning like the tough compares. Is 3% what we should be thinking about as kind of the new norm when we  get that business...(00:50:15)? Well, yeah. So, a couple of question – or a couple of comments, James. First, remember in many ways, the most important aspect of our GNS network these days is driving coverage in 170 or so countries around the globe. And we rely on a network of great partners to do that for us in many countries, and that's priority one. Second thing is that not all GNS billings are the same. In general, as you know, the financial contribution from GNS itself is more modest than its billing contribution. That contribution also varies a lot from country to country, and we have a few large countries that drive a whole lot of billings, much more modest economics, and those billings can be a little bit volatile quarter to quarter. So I wouldn't take the 3% as a mark of what you will consistently see once we finish lapping Europe and Australia. I think, you'll see it probably trend back up a little bit from there. But the most important thing to keep in mind is the GNS network around the globe is really about coverage. We have a question in queue from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff, just wanted to put a finer point on your EPS  metrics (00:51:39). Because I know you didn't formally narrow the full year EPS range, but it sounds like you're pointing us to around $2.03 or so for Q4 which I think would get us to around $8.19 or so for the full year. So, I just wanted to clarify that. And then do you think that we've troughed in terms of large enterprise volume growth, just the down 1% this quarter? I know there were some moving parts there, but... So, let me make a few comments on guidance maybe including philosophy, Jason. And then, Steve, you can comment on the large and global customers. Look, our philosophy which we have tried to be true to this year as we come out at the beginning of the year and we tell you here's our expectations for the full year and we give you some color around that, and then our expectation is as we report our results each quarter, we're going to tell you if something has happened so dramatically that it takes us out of that original range. But beyond that, we're just going to give you some color about how things are going. We also really want to emphasize that we are running the company for the long-term. We're certainly not running it to produce quarter-by-quarter results, but we will be true to our annual kinds of earnings commitments. So, that's just I think important background. As to the specific math, look, I think, Jason, you did your math. I'm not going to confirm or not confirm your specific math. But I think, I was trying to be very clear that our operating performance has been really consistent across the first three quarters. You can measure that at $2 a share, $2.07 a share, probably $2.03 for this quarter, and we'd expect the fourth quarter to look something like that. As far as global and large accounts, global and large accounts in 2018 had a really terrific year. And so going into this year, our expectations weren't the same expectations as they were last year. As we think about sort of planning forward, I would think about sort of the 0% range for the fourth quarter for global and large accounts, and then I think it gets back to historical levels for us, which is anywhere between 1% and 4%. It's just because a lot of that is T&E. As we start to penetrate more into the B2B space, then I think you'll see that go up. But as I've said, traditionally, as I have met with CFOs and so forth, they're not driving to move their T&E spend up. What you're looking for us to do is actually to help them manage their T&E spend down. And so, it's a very interesting business in that our value proposition is we help you manage your costs down. And we do that through benchmarking, we do that through helping them negotiate, and we do that by providing insights. And so it's an interesting business where to retain accounts, you actually help them shrink a little bit. And so then you need to go get some more accounts. So, we're very comfortable with sort of the traditional levels. I think what you saw last year was just people getting out a lot more, including ourselves actually, and just spending a little bit more on T&E. But I think it's fair to think about this in sort of the 0% to 3% range going forward. We'll go next to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please. Yes. Good morning. So, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the small business year-over-year spend growth rate. I mean, there's a couple factors. Obviously, you've got potentially like weaker or more caution on the core business front. But I assume you're still getting that secular penetration. I wanted to know if that's still happening at the same rate. And then also, your position in small business is remarkably higher than your peers. Is there any change in competition? Are you holding share? Or is this all just sort of normal caution in tougher comps? And then lastly around that same thing, when does B2B kick in as these small businesses automate accounts payable, accounts receivable? I think you had said you get a 42% uplift in spend as that happens. I mean, is it just so early in that process? Will we see it in 2020, 2021? Thank you. Yeah, so, Don, the last question first. I think it's still early in the process. Automating that spend and what you do with someone like ACOM or what you do with some of the other providers, these are interfaces to whatever sort of accounts receivable procurement systems that they have, and it's not always their priority to do that. So that takes a little bit of time. So, you'll see a little bit of uptick in 2020, 2021, so forth and so on. Look, I think that – let's just talk about sort of secular penetration. I think, we are still acquiring accounts, and we don't look at so much at accounts as we look at acquired billed business. We're acquiring billed business at pretty much the same rate we've been acquiring it. As I mentioned before, we're not losing accounts at any higher level or lower level than we've had probably for the last eight quarters. We're pretty consistent on that. As far as our overall position in the market, I think it's really consistent and hasn't really changed. I'll point you back to what I said before. I think the downturn that we've seen in our growth rate here is really around what we would call organic, and not that it's not growing, it's not just growing fast enough or it's not growing at the same rate it did last year when it had a lot of momentum, especially from the Tax Act. Having said all that, there is more competition in this space than we've seen in a long, long time because much like banks found after sort of the Great Recession that the consumer credit card business was an attractive area, banks have now found that this area is attractive as well. Having said that, if you added the next five largest issuers up in this small business space, I'll have the same refrain that I've had for the last two years. We're bigger than them all put together. So we're really comfortable where we are. We don't see anything from a competitive perspective that is any different other than it keeps the step up to the competition. But and we continue to add to our array of products whether it's working capital terms, whether it's merchant financing, cross border, and obviously, the continued enhancements to our small business product. So we still feel really good about where we are from a small business perspective. Our final question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please. Thanks. Maybe just to follow-up with some of the lines of questioning previously. When you guys think about your comfort in delivering the high levels of revenue growth next year, which I assume is within the range of what we saw in 2019, how possible is it to, say, hit those numbers with some more moderation in billed business volumes? Is your level of comfort because you feel like some of the investments you've made will sustain that type of billed business growth, or do you expect the high levels of fee income growth will persist given the Delta fees come on in 2020? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Yes. So, I know, I mean, look, I think when you make – here's the issue, right. So many investments that you make this year don't pay off this year. They pay off as it goes next year. And so you've hit the nail on the head. When you think about sort of what we've done from a Delta perspective, when you think about the cards that we've acquired, when you think about some of the investments that we've made in some of the digital properties, when you think about sort of the consistent high discount revenue that we've had, yeah, even with a tick down in billings, that still will be positive, and yet our fee revenue due to our continued maniacal focus on card refreshes. The other thing I would point out is that this is a growth story, globally. This is not a growth story just in the United States. And so when you think about 14% billings growth in consumer internationally, 18% SME growth, even a tick or two down there is not really going to hurt you all that much. And we've been pretty consistent from an SME and consumer perspective. So, I think when you think about the three-legged stool that we have from a revenue perspective of fees, net – interest income, and discount revenue, we feel really comfortable. And that's why as Jeff said in his sort of at the end of his remarks, in this same economic environment, we feel good about 8% to 10%. Look, the billings this year weren't exactly what we had projected, and look where we are from a revenue perspective. So, yes, our comfort level is there. With that, we'll bring the call to an end.

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thanks you for standing by and welcome to the Bank OZK Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Tim Hicks. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning. I'm Tim Hicks, Chief Administrative Officer and Executive Director of Investor Relations for Bank OZK. Thank you for joining our call this morning and participating in our question-and-answer session. In today's Q&A discussion we may make forward-looking statements about our expectations, estimates, and outlook for the future. Please refer to our earnings release, management comments, and other public filings for more information on the various factors and risks that may cause actual results or outcomes to vary from those projected in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Joining me on the call to take your questions are George Gleason, Chairman and CEO; and Greg McKinney, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. We will now open up the lines for your questions. Let me ask our operator, Jonathan, to remind our listeners how to queue in for questions. Jonathan? Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Excellent. Good morning. Was hoping we could just start off in terms of RESG. Very good originations. Can you just talk a little bit about what drove the higher origination volume in RESG and was it a lot of loans, was it a couple large loans? Thanks. Thank you, Ken. I'll address that. Yes, we did have our best origination quarter in RESG since 2017. We had loans of all sizes. We originated our largest loan ever in the quarter, we originated a lot of small loans I believe. The – I'm not sure of this number, but I think the number of closings in the quarter were 30-something I believe; don't hold me to that. But it was a good job that our team did. We're being very disciplined and our credit quality continuing to hold very diligently to our long-established and consistent credit quality standards. We have been very protective of our return on investment on most loans and are not doing transactions that are just so cheap that they're not generating a good return for us. So I'm very pleased with the job that our team did in originating a diversity of credit and a diversity of our market, holding to our credit standards and we're just going to have to continue to work hard and find those good opportunities that fit our credit and profitability profile. Okay. Great. And then in terms of the margin, obviously it came down about 19 basis points this quarter and that's on one rate hike, and I get LIBOR has been coming down too. But if we end up getting two rate cuts, one in September and then one on October, how should we think about margin? I mean, is there any reason to think it wouldn't be down twice as much as the 19 basis points or are there any offsets? Hey, Ken. This is Tim. Yeah, we had two rate cuts in Q3, so July and September. I believe one-month LIBOR was down 40 basis points during the quarter. So with 75% of our loans variable and 82% of those variably based on one-month or three-month LIBOR, we've got a chart in here that explains that, we're going to be really variable, very sensitive to that move in one and three-month LIBOR, specifically one-month LIBOR, until we have the chance for our floors to catch up, and we've got a chart here on floors as well. You can see that on figure 14, page 13 of management comments that we have total commitment, 27% of our current loans are at their floor; that was 15% a quarter ago. Another down 50 basis points, half of our loans, total commitment will be at a floor of 47% specifically. So that will help eventually alleviate some of the decline in loan yields which would help alleviate the decline in net interest margin. On the other hand, deposit cost should continue to benefit and continue to go down. We had a good decrease in deposit cost during the quarter, down 6 basis points during the quarter. We'd expect that to continue in the fourth quarter and the size and magnitude of that will depend on how many rate cuts we'd get and when. Ken, we add also – I might refer you to figure 13 on page 12 of the management comments. We added a box at the bottom of that that just showed our quarter-over-quarter change in core spread over the Fed increasing cycle in the last several quarters. And as you can see, they're going back to when the Fed started increasing rates because of our LIBOR-heavy book. Loan yields increased faster than deposit cost and then ultimately deposit cost caught up. So over the upcycle our change in yield on loans and change in yield on deposits, cost of deposits was fairly equal. And obviously with LIBOR plummeting really quickly with the Fed cutting rates 2 times in a quarter and the expectation of further Fed cuts, LIBOR is outrunning our ability to adjust our deposit cost. We think over the full downcycle and a couple quarters or three quarters or something after the Fed is through cutting rates that our deposit cost changes will largely catch up with our loan yield changes. But just as deposit cost lagged coming up, they're going to lag going down so we would've certainly preferred the Fed have not started cutting rates when they did, and giving us a few more quarters to cycle our floor rates out would've been helpful but... Of course. ...they didn't do that. Yeah. And if we do get an October cut, where do you envision NIM falling out in fourth quarter? We're not giving a specific guidance on that. As you can obviously imagine, if LIBOR drops our loan yields will drop. Tim mentioned we expect deposit cost to continue to come down and get better quarter-to-quarter. But there will be a lag effect in that probably. Got you, okay. And then just one last question if I may. You mentioned in the release that you expect expenses to continue to move higher. What pace of expense growth are you envisioning going forward? Hey, Ken. This is Greg. I think comments and responses to that question would be similar to how we responded a quarter ago. I think we are towards the end but still continuing to build some of the infrastructure. Specifically we had some expenditures over the last quarter or two related to our CECL model validations,  (00:08:13) validations for third parties, so those have continued to keep our expense increases a little bit on the elevated side. That probably continues for another quarter or two although we're certainly working towards trying to get that much more moderated. We'll still grow but much more moderated as we get into 2020. We do have the new headquarters coming on so that will begin – the depreciation of that building we'll get at some point during probably the second quarter of 2020. But that's – I think  our thoughts (00:08:48) around trends in non-interest expense are very similar to our comments last quarter. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor from KBW. Your question please. Thanks. Good morning. Hey. Good morning. Maybe one follow up on the deposit side. Is there any way to give us some color around what deposit cost did on a monthly basis so we can kind of see where deposit cost ended just for maybe the month of September as a gauge for what we may see in the fourth quarter? Yeah. I mean, I think Catherine, this is Tim, obviously September was below where our quarter number was a few basis points, so that's going to help us for the quarter, give us kind of a good head start. Obviously there's a lag effect obviously to the two moves that we had in Q3 on the Fed funds target rate. I would also mention our CD book. Our CD book in Q3 I would say was probably a headwind to the overall decrease. That should improve as time goes on and be less of a headwind to overall decrease. So we're not giving a specific range but we've got things moving in our direction that should help us for Q4. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on big picture growth we saw a little bit with the origination volume and we saw better kind of bottom line growth this past quarter. Any thoughts on just kind of as you look forward to the level of repayments that you may expect in the near-term, do you feel like next quarter or kind of into early 2020 you'll still be able to net grow the balance sheet or is your forecast for repayment still to where the balance sheet may be relatively, kind of stable to flat? Catherine, let me – this is George. Let me address that. I think we generally expect a moderate growth in the balance sheet next year, certainly not anything that's going to rise probably to the level of robust. We still will be contending with the pay downs from our purchased loan portfolio as everyone has known and seen for several years. We will still be contending with a high level of RESG loan payouts. We would hope that our RESG team would be able to do what they did this quarter and that is work hard, find good opportunities that fit our credit and profitability profile to continue to replace the payoffs and achieve some net growth in the RESG book. The other two big loans components, community banking, we think we will do better in growth in community banking next year. One of the reasons that salary cost have been going up is we've been adding staff and we'll continue to add staff in those community bank lending verticals. We feel like we're really getting well-positioned to achieve a bit of accelerated growth in the community banking area that I suspect will be offset by more modest growth in the indirect marine and RV business. Those of you who monitor that sector from a dealer point of view will know, and a manufacturer point of view will know that sales of marine and RV equipment is down, and that's resulting in less consumer paper which is where we are in the space, and yet the competition for that paper is pretty robust. So we are, just like we've done in RESG, as we faced a declining volume of opportunities and increased competition we're holding very rigidly to our very strong credit standards on that paper. We underwrite that in a very specific way so that we believe we'll achieve outcomes from that portfolio far better than the typical marine or RV portfolio outcome. We're going to hold those credit standards tight, we will not go below a certain pricing point. So I think we'll see a reduction in our growth in indirect marine and RV next year. I think we'll have nice growth but well off the pace of growth we've had there. I think you'll see that largely to some degree, plus or minus some degree offset by increased growth in the community banking side. So we're not giving any specific growth guidance for next year. We would expect overall loan growth to be moderate, and I'll leave it at that for now for next year. Great. That's really helpful color. Thank you, George. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timur Braziler from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question please. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Maybe just circling back to prior comments on the largest loan book to-date at RESG. Can you give us a little bit more color on credit? Well I will tell you it was a loan in the Tampa area in Florida. It meets all of our standards for a really large credit. It has outstanding sponsorship, it is an incredibly exciting and well thought-out and to be well-executed project based on what we've seen. So it meets our standards of being a high-quality project with truly great sponsorship and a great market and we're very excited about it. It's a very defensive structure. You can see the loan to value and loan to cost numbers in our tables. You'll notice that on the aggregate, most of the loans we originate or most of our volume in the quarter just ended was at even lower loan to value and loan to cost numbers than the portfolio. So we actually had a slight downtrend on our average loan to cost number for the portfolio last quarter because the things that paid off were slightly higher than the things that went on, so very conservative high-quality project with great sponsorship. Okay. And was it a condo or a hotel or...? It is actually a multiple of buildings that will include office, condo, apartment, retail, a parking facility and various other components. It's a very mixed-use multi-building project. Okay. That's helpful. And then appreciate all the color around margin on the deposit side. Maybe just looking at the asset mix, what type of origination yields are you getting on the indirect RV/marine paper, on the community paper, and on RESG? Well it varies quite a bit from loan to loan. On the RESG side, those are complex credits in some cases and straightforward and simple credits in others, and depending on the different credit type, the different market and the complexity, the value we bring with our expertise to it we get different pricing on different loans. But I'll tell you that really hasn't significantly changed this year. The pricing that we were getting early in the year is very similar to the pricing we're getting now there. Obviously the marine and RV pricing has come down over the course of the year that is heavily affected by 5-year and 10-year type yields, and the yield curve has flattened and dropped this year. That paper has come down. I think probably the typical paper we're getting is a mid 5s coupon. Of course we're paying a premium for that to the dealer or the correspondent on that. So we're looking at probably a low 5s, high 4s, very high 4s net yield on that paper. Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last one from me. It's now been a couple years since Dan's departure from the bank. Just wondering if you can provide an update on how that transition has gone? Any – or how has the clients reacted? Any kind of meaningful attrition there or anything else worth noting? I will tell you I think our RESG team today is the best, most capable RESG team working in the most collaborative, effective manner that we've ever had. So we're thrilled to death with our team there. And Dan's departure was long ago and that was an issue that was in the rearview mirror for us the day after he left. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose from Raymond James. Your question please. Hey. Good morning. In the management comments you guys talked about a four-pronged approach to turn around what has been I think three quarters in a row of net interest income decline. Can you elaborate on those a little bit more? And then as we move into 2020, you talked about some modest balance sheet growth. Do you actually think with the margin headwinds, and I know it depends on rates obviously, but do you actually think you can grow net interest income next year? Thanks. That's a good question, Michael, and time will tell on that obviously. How many LIBOR – how many Fed funds cuts we get, what the expectations reflected in forward LIBOR rates become as the rate scenario evolves will have a big impact on that. We are working hard to get our deposit cost down but we're doing that also in the context of really trying to achieve some qualitative shifts and adjustments in our deposit book as well, and we did that in the quarter just ended and we'll continue to do that and we think we'll get deposit cost down. I pretty much responded to the growth thing in response to Catherine's question. RESG is going to have to continue to stay disciplined and work really hard, and as I said earlier I'm super proud of our team for the job they did originating the volume they did in a very competitive environment where there are fewer loan opportunities out there that meet our high standards than there probably were two or three years ago. So they did a great job booking good quality business, a good yield in the quarter just ended. If we can continue to do that and offset or more than offset the pay downs that will come from the RESG portfolio and have a decent margin growth in RESG that will certainly be helpful. We expect less growth as I already detailed probably in the marine/RV space next year than this year. We expect more growth in the community bank space. So obviously there are a lot of variables, the future of interest rates being a big one there and then the rate of decline in interest rate. All those factors play in. If the Fed cuts rates one or two more times and stops and we have an environment in 2020 where our loan yields are not dropping because the Fed's not dropping rates and our deposit cost are declining and catching up with the decline in loan yields already, that would make for an improving picture. If the Fed continues to lower rates throughout next year or through much of next year and our deposit cost reductions are always  lies in (00:22:31) the Fed action after starting off in a liked position here this quarter, then that'll be a more difficult position. So we'll see how it plays out. Okay. And then maybe just one follow up for me. In the comments again, no share repurchase program at this point yet capital continues to build, probably will continue to build. As we think about it in a post-CECL world, I mean where do you kind of see optimal capital levels? I would assume that this is too high and that you think at some point in the future you'll deploy some of that capital. But I think consistently you guys have gotten the question about a buyback and return of capital and just how should we think about all that. Thanks. Hey, Michael. It's Tim. I would think about it as an active conversation that management and the board have each quarterly board meeting. Obviously, we've got very strong capital levels. We've never done a buyback for our 22-year history as a public company. We saw a lot of tremendous opportunities during the last downturn. We were able to capitalize on those because we had such strong earnings and capital levels. We want to position ourselves to be able to capitalize on those opportunities if another downturn occurs. But as you pointed out, our capital levels continue to grow and we'll continue to have conversation at the board level and we'll update you when we change, if we do change and they've come to the same answer every meeting. But as you said, we do have very strong capital levels and I think that's a great position to be in right now. It allows us to have a lot of flexibility in our strategic planning going forward and we're satisfied with our capital levels being at an elevated level right now. And Michael, I would add to that that there's a diversity of opinion probably everywhere on what the right strategy is there. And I'll – to give an example of that, one of our substantial shareholders who have been a very strong advocate for stock repurchases for several quarters called me after the last earnings call, and I was expecting him to once again articulate his belief we ought to quickly pursue a stock buyback. And I was very surprised when he said he wanted to tell me that he had been thinking about it, and in light of the growing geopolitical tensions and political tensions in the US and economic uncertainty he had decided that we were taking the right approach and that accumulating more excess capital he thought was prudent in light of the fact that we have a demonstrated ability in economic downturns from the past to capitalize on significant opportunities and he thought we would have that opportunity again. Nobody can be sure about that, but that was an interesting indicator to me from one of our shareholders who have been strongly in favor of it that he has now come around to the other side of the equation based on the geopolitical uncertainty around the economic environment. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Olney from Stephens. Your question please. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning and I guess I want to go back to the RESG discussion. A few years ago following the restructuring I thought there was a focus to look at some loans in newer markets, markets that maybe were not top five in the country. And at the time I thought this would result in the average loan size in RESG would be decreasing, but we're not seeing that; we're just seeing RESG do larger loans and of record size. So I'm curious what your expectations are as far as the average size of the RESG loans going forward? Yeah. That's a good question, Matt, and I would tell you both scenarios that you describe there are playing out. We are originating loans. For example, our market presence in Philadelphia has increased. Washington where three or four years ago we had zero presence has become an important market for us. Boston, we've gotten several significant transactions on the board there; we've only occasionally had one or two there in the past. We've got some nice transactions in Minneapolis. We've got a transaction we're actually looking at in Detroit which I've spent a day in Detroit not long ago and was quite impressed with the resurgence that's going on in certain parts of the city there. And there's a diversity of other markets that we are doing transactions in and those do tend on average, in the more secondary or smaller markets tend to be smaller transactions. On the other hand, in a market where competition is intense and pricing is aggressive on a lot of middle size transactions where we add a lot of value is on very complex transactions that our expertise and ability to execute really makes it worth our customer paying our rates and our pricing and putting up with our low leverage deal structure to have us in the transaction because we bring value with our expertise and ability to execute. So the other side of that is we are doing a lot of larger transactions and that's because we get great assets and really world-class sponsorship on those big transactions because only big companies with great track record and big balance sheets and so forth can do those, so you get great sponsorship on a great transaction, you get paid well for it because they're paying for your expertise and execution ability. So I think it continues to be a mixture of both of those things. We did a transaction that was our largest ever in the quarter just ended; at the same time we had a $15 million RESG transaction in a smaller market in loan committee just last week. So I think it really does reflect the fact that we are going into some markets doing transactions, smaller transactions in some secondary markets. At the same time we're continuing to harvest on good opportunities, really primo opportunities that we get because of our expertise and execution ability. Okay. That's great, George. Thank you. And then can you just give us an update on the South Carolina and North Carolina loans that we've discussed previously on these calls? Yes, of course. They're both in OREO as they were last quarter. We are working to liquidate those. We think we're making some good progress toward them. We don't have either one of them fully liquidated. We've got several pieces of the North Carolina property under contract to sell. We've got some very serious interest in the South Carolina property which we hope will result in the closing of the sale of that property. So we're working on them. Nothing adverse  (00:31:02) but we don't have them liquidated yet either. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Your question please. Thanks. I guess just getting back to the deposit discussion, I think in your management commentary there's a section where basically it kind of makes the point that over time these changes in loan pricing and deposit pricing will kind of even out. Do you think that as we head into the fourth quarter you have some of that benefit, right? Because you had your loan change in 3Q and you'll get a bit of a catch up in 4Q. Is it going to be a longer lag than that or – I'm just trying to understand the pace of how that catch up might work. Well Arren, I think that really depends on expectations and what the Fed does on rates. If the expectation is the Fed's going to cut rates then that's going to keep LIBOR trending down, and if the Fed actually does cut rates that's going to cement that decline in LIBOR and future expectations further down. So we could have a situation for a while, particularly if the Fed's cutting two quarters at a time, where the decline in our loan yields continues to be lagged by our decline in deposit cost. If on the other hand the Fed cuts one or two more times and stops then our deposit cost will catch up more quickly. We, I don't know, had a 13 or 15 or 17-quarter period where the Fed raised rates nine times and over that period of time I think there was a 4 basis point difference between our change in cost of interest-bearing deposits and our change in non-purchased loan yields. We would expect a similar, very close correlation between the change in our cost of interest-bearing deposits, non-purchased loan yields over the full gamut of a Fed loosening period, and including a couple of quarters or three quarters or so after the end to allow everything to catch up and normalize. So I don't know when the deposit cost catch up with the loan yields but that just kind of depends as I said earlier on the number of Fed cuts, the period for all of that, and how quickly they do that. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And we've heard that there's been a little bit more interest from smaller banks in terms of M&A, a little bit more discussion from some other banks. Are you seeing that? And I know you don't have much of a currency these days, but you are building capital and you might be able to do a little bit more cash with the M&A environment currently. Our focus really is internal and organic and really trying to improve and enhance, advance the quality of what we're doing as a company every day. That's not to say that we wouldn't look at an M&A opportunity, but I think it would have to be something extremely compelling. And I think the better M&A opportunities for us will be after the next downturn, when the quality of our loan portfolio is fully demonstrated and that's reflected – the quality of what we're doing is reflected in our stock price more significantly. And the aggressive lending that some of or other banks out there are doing is fully reflected in their results and their stock price is down and they're much more motivated sellers. So I don't see us engaging in M&A activity certainly the remainder of this year and probably not in next year and maybe not even the year following that; I think that's a longer-term proposition. We feel that the quality of our portfolio as it's reflected in our stock price today is greatly underappreciated, and the quality of some other banks that we see is greatly over-appreciated because they're not concentrated but we see what they're doing and we think that's not very sound; we would never do that. And we think in due time that dual realization of reality on both sides will make an opportunity for us to make acquisitions that make sense. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your question please. Hi. Good morning. I was – and most of my questions have been addressed, but in looking at your deposit composition we're still – you got the cost down which was great, but it's still kind of driven by the higher cost deposits. And I know you've hired a deposit czar or something similar, but wondering when you're going to be able to show more growth in kind of the lower cost categories? Brock, I would tell you that's a significant 2020 goal and there's a lot of effort being expended in that regard. And yes, we've not only hired a Chief Deposit Officer and built out a team of analysts and people in support of him, we've been significantly reevaluating how we greatly improve and position our community banking team and products and so forth for the future. So Cindy Wolfe who's our Chief Banking Officer and Carmen McClennon who has taken a significant role in our retail banking deposit side, operational side for the future, the way we do digital services, call center, our online banking products, our existing portfolio banking products, all of that is undergoing a significant revamping that you'll see in the first half of 2020, and we think that we've got a great plan there that will significantly improve the quality and quantity and cost of our deposit base in future years. Steps are being taken incrementally to make adjustments every, really probably every month and every quarter. But the real significant revamp and redesign of all of that is going to appear and be implemented in 2020 and then you'll start seeing, as 2020 rolls on, some benefits from that. In support of that, Cindy Wolfe, our Chief Banking Officer; and Alan Jessup, our Director of Community Banking, Cindy is on the deposit and operational side, Alan is on the loan side. And a number of other people, and I have visited every one of our 260 branch, 260 offices, loan operations, deposit operation centers, LPOs since between late November of last year and mid-September of this year. And we've asked our staff to recommend how we can improve our company. We've gotten hundreds and hundreds of recommendations on that. We've really implemented already hundreds of those recommendations. And we've got from that and from visiting all of our markets and really getting down in the deepest weeds and understanding that I think we've got a plan that's not just a quick fix effort to improve our deposit mix but really a fundamental long-term strategy to have – to really position ourselves for the next decade very well on the deposit side. So we're making some progress. We're going to make a lot more progress but we're going to do that in the context of a really strategic long-term plan for our retail banking operations, and that's all going forward at a very brisk clip. There's a lot of work being done on it but it's a big project. Excellent. Okay. Great, more than I've bargained for. In the meantime, are you opening any branches or really focusing on the network that you have? We opened a branch in South Fort Worth last quarter. We are opening a branch in South Dallas area this quarter I think. Already have opened it. Already have opened it this quarter. Thank you. We've got three branches we're opening in the Metro Atlanta area. I think there's one more some place, Tim. No, that's it. Okay. And then we've closed a few branches. We closed a redundant branch in Mobile, Alabama that was underperforming and similarly closed branches in Clarksville, Arkansas and... Magnolia. ...Magnolia, Arkansas. And so we're – as part of a review of all of our retail banking infrastructure, we've identified a few needs we have where we're opening branches. We've identified a few branches that we think are underperforming and not needed. I think we'll probably identify a few more along the way that we'll rationalize and get our structure where it will serve our customers. Excellent. Okay. That's impressive. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Martin from Janney Montgomery. Your question please. Good morning. None Can you hear me now? Yes. Yes. Okay. Sorry about that, George. So I wondered, George, can you just comment at all – I know you talked about you're opportunistic ability in the community bank, your optimism I should say in the community banking environment next year, just to kind of really see that ramp up. Can you just talk at all about some of the hires you've made or just any more I guess you're kind of looking to beef up on and how that may contribute to the growth outlook you have with the optimism, maybe just geographically or by division or segment that you're kind of focused on or where you've seen a ramp up in? Yeah. We're adding folks in a variety of space. We've added a couple folks on our business aviation group in the last six months or so. We're adding team members in our  GG&L (00:43:23), our government guaranteed SBA lending group. We're adding a person or two in affordable housing and charter school finance. We've reallocated some internal resources to get a little more horsepower in our – manpower in our subscription finance business. We're continuing to increasingly integrate our middle market CRE group, that is our community banking CRE group that handles CRE loans in an RESG like sort of fashion. But it's not a miniature RESG; it's really an arm that is intended to facilitate and make sure that the quality of CRE we originate in our community bank is similar to the quality of commercial real estate we do in our RESG group. We're adding a few generalist lenders around in different markets and a lot of the specialty lending vertical guys around in different markets. We've added a couple of guys in homebuilder finance, and that business continues to be good. We are trimming some customers whose leverage ratios and inventory numbers are not meeting our standards. We're adding customers that have strong balance sheets and really good business models and good margins and are doing a good job managing their inventory and in markets where there's good growth. So it's just a broad-based continuous adjustment of trying to add people where we see opportunity in different lines of business and curtail or reduce resources in areas where we see the opportunities waning. Okay. I appreciate the color, George. Thanks so much. Yeah. I would add, Brian, that after visiting all of our offices in the last 11 months, taking a full inventory and understanding of every market in the company and our ability to meet the needs and the opportunities in those markets has really helped us fine-tune our plan for allocating resources going forward where we think we'll get the maximum effect from that. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.  And we have a follow up from the line of Matt Olney from Stephens. Your question please. Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow up. I wanted to ask about your CECL disclosures, and it sounds like you gave it to us in two parts in the management commentary. The first part seems pretty straightforward with the general allowance. But the second part of the CECL disclosure I guess is the liability for the unfunded commitments that seems to be more unique to Bank OZK. Can you help us understand how is this going to work and will that allowance set – will that be separate from the overall allowance? Brian, I don't think that is – or Matt, I don't think that is unique to us. It's just more evident in our numbers because our construction and development portfolio have a much bigger number of unfunded commitments than a lot of banks. So Greg, you want to...? Yeah. So Matt, obviously with $11-plus billion of unfunded, under CECL we have to evaluate that. We have to over our projected period forecast of funding of that and then run that through our model for purposes that allow us. From a balance sheet standpoint that will reside in the liability section, not in the allowance section so we broke those closures out. In evaluating that, Matt, we really kind of ran multiple scenarios looking at a reasonable, optimistic  (00:47:44) pessimistic type scenario, weigh the scenarios, try to set bands around our expectations on where that lands on day one, and that's what we've provided. That should tighten up somewhat as we move throughout Q4 and get ready to go live come first quarter of 2020. But yes, that will reside in the liability section. From an income statement standpoint it all runs through provision. But dependent on whether you're talking about whether it's funded balances, own balance sheet or whether you're talking about unfunded it can land at a different spot on the balance sheet. And I would – Greg, let me clarify. As far as running through provision, the adoption of CECL day one adjustment is all a... It's a capital adjustment. It's a capital adjustment and the running through provision going forward is a go-forward. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to hand the program back to Mr. Gleason for any further remarks. All right. Thank you guys very much. We appreciate you joining the call today. Thank you. We look forward to talking with you in about three months. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

         "Good morning. Thank you for joining OFG Bancorp's Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I will be your conference operator today. Our speakers are José Rafael Fernández, President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman; and Maritza Arizmendi, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A presentation accompanies today's remarks. It can be found on the Investor Relations website on the home page in the What's New box, or on the Webcasts, Presentations & Other Files page.

We also direct you to the explanation of non-GAAP measurements that are included in our presentation and news release. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Fernández. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Please turn to slide 3, before the market open today, we reported third quarter results, which reflected the impact of several non-core strategic transactions. We generated a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity also improved, and reported net interest margin continued at a level similar to top performing peer banks in the mainland. We are extremely pleased with our core performance. Our levels of small business, auto and consumer loan production; core deposit growth, credit quality and capital; and the number of net new customers, all confirm the effectiveness of our differentiation strategies. Since we made our Scotiabank announcement, we have been engaged in extensive integration planning. We're extremely excited about how the acquisition will significantly enhance our position as a premier retail bank on the island and establish a strong foothold in another Caribbean market. As always, thanks to our OFG team and the new members, who will be joining us from Scotiabank for their commitment and dedication and to all our retail and commercial customers for their loyalty and support. Please turn to slide 4, during the third quarter, we took advantage of positive market conditions both in the US fixed income markets and here in Puerto Rico and decided to sell a good portion of our remaining NPLs, to sell some fully charged-off loans at a profit and to sell almost 40% of our investment securities. Here's how these and other items affected our results. First, provision was increased by a net $32 million. This reflected a $39 million increase primarily from deciding to sell $95 million of unpaid principal balance NPLs. This was partially offset by $2.4 million in proceeds from the sale of $26 million of fully charged-off auto and consumer loans. It was also partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses due to improving asset quality trends in Puerto Rico. Second, we had a $3.5 million gain from selling $322 million in low-yielding mortgage backed securities. I'd like to point out the tactical, as well as the strategic benefits of all these transactions. First, they further strengthen our already strong liquidity and balance sheet, as we continue to deploy our growth strategy. Originated non-performing loans are now 40% lower year-over-year. Selling them enables us to free up resources, reduce related expenses and increase operating flexibility. Combined with our MBS sales, we have close to $1 billion in cash to fund our growth plans, including prefunding our $560 million acquisition of Scotiabank's Puerto Rico and US Virgin Island operations. Second our MBS sale also resulted in another major reduction in higher cost brokered CDs and wholesale borrowings, which are now down a total of 42% year-over-year. From a management point of view, all of this gets rid of potential distractions, so we can focus all our attention on our integration plans with Scotiabank and our growth strategies. Please turn to slide 5 to review our financial performance. Net revenues total more than $99 million, while down slightly year-over-year, they remained up 3% year-to-date. A key factor in the third quarter was an 8.7% increase in originated loan income, which offset declines in income from the runoff of acquired loans and of investment securities due to the mortgage-backed securities sales. Core non-interest income continued at very steady levels. As a result, on an adjusted basis, earnings per share came in at $0.48, return on average asset was 1.65%, return on average tangible common equity was 11.18%, efficiency ratio was 52.10%, and reported tangible book value per common share was $17.11, up 5.4%. Please turn to slide 6 to review our operational highlights. Total net loans increased 1.2% to $4.4 billion. Growth of originated loans at 4.8% more than offset the continued paydown of acquired loans, and the sale of non-performing loans that we announced earlier. Loan production totaled $291 million compared to $347 million in the year-ago quarter. Auto and consumer lending remained strong at $142 million and $48 million, respectively. Commercial lending at $66 million reflected continued growth of small business customers. Core deposit average balances increased 3.4% to $4.6 billion approximately. This reflects growth in commercial loans, net new customers and our larger core retail funding base. Loan yield declined 7 basis points reflecting higher returns on originated loans and lower yields on acquired loans. Originated loan yield increased 11 basis points from the net effect of Federal Reserve rate hikes last year and a larger proportion of higher yielding originated commercial and auto loans in the portfolio. Core deposit costs continued to remain relatively low, up only 18 basis points year-over-year. The end result was a net interest margin of 5.35%. Please turn to slide 7 to review credit and capital. The net charge-off rate and provision, obviously, increased as a result of our non-performing loan sales. The sales, however, reduced the NPL rate 145 basis points year-over-year, as well as the total delinquency rate. And excluding items, provision of $11.7 million declined $2.8 million reflecting better asset quality and improving economic conditions. Capital continued to build. Once again, our ratios increased across the board to new multi-year high. Total stockholders' equity increased 8.2% to $1.05 billion. Our tangible common equity ratio climbed to 14.07%. In our news release, we provided a formal indication of how CECL implementation will affect us. We're estimating an increase in the current allowance in the range of 16% to 23% for the originated book and no effect on the acquired book. Please turn to slide 8 for outlook. To sum up, we're building excellent momentum as we prepare to close on our acquisition of Scotiabank's Puerto Rico and USVI operations. We expect to receive regulatory approval by the end of the year. We're excited for what our future holds as we will continue or as we will become the premier retail bank in Puerto Rico. With this, we end our formal presentation. Thanks to everyone for listening. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer session. Thank you  Our first question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Brett. I wanted to first ask, José Rafael, can you just talk about for a second, when you look at the macro picture in Puerto Rico, the stats tend to be flattish,  The GII Index (00:09:56) has been bumping along at 120, cruise ship visitors have been down a little bit, auto sales are okay. There was a report last week on Bloomberg, it referenced a few other things talking about the potential for Puerto Rico to only get $39 billion of the $69 billion of funds from FEMA and HUD. I was just curious if you could give us some color on what you're seeing economically in Puerto Rico and then what you've heard about the potential decline of funds coming to Puerto Rico? Sure. So, what I think we're living right now here in the island is transitioning, and the economy transitioning from not only the aftermath of Maria reconstruction and, but also for the last 12, 13 years of economic contraction. So, federal funds are coming in, they're coming in slower than anticipated. There's still a little bit there of a uncertainty regarding the magnitude of how many funds are going to come and  (00:11:10) to the island. But the truth is that there's very little knowledge in the ground in terms of the specifics, Brett, in terms of the dollars, and on when are those funds coming in. They are certainly trickling primarily for the roads and there's a lot of rebuilding on the roads and the bridges, there's still work in progress in terms of the Electric Power Authority and its restructure. There's still a lot of expectations on the housing funds coming in for rebuilding and actually, building new homes. But we are seeing some of our larger construction services clients being awarded projects to build and rebuild homes. And those  firms (00:12:09) have already been allocated, they've been awarded, and they have yet to be disbursed, because there's still some  hoops (00:12:17) to go through. So, my expectation would be that we will continue the end of the year as we have seen so far this year with lots of noise on when the monies will come in and how much will come in and how the  fiscal board (00:12:30) portrays in Washington, how much is the fiscal plan, including in terms of federal funds. But I do believe that there are lots of moving parts and there are lots of listeners out there that have a vested interest, particularly bondholders, on how these things come out. So, I think we'll continue to have quite a bit of noise and create somewhat the uncertainty that is keeping the economy relatively flat. My expectation would be the next year, funds will start flowing in a more consistent basis and the impact on the economy as most of the local non-political economists in the island are projecting and we'll see the results. So far, I am encouraged. I am encouraged with what we're seeing and our customers, commercial and consumer, are certainly in a much better financial position  than (00:13:37) they were a couple of years ago and their balance sheets show it. Okay. Appreciate all the color there. I was also curious with all the changes in the balance sheet here, can you give us an idea of how interest income might play out with the four pieces, originated loans, acquired, cash and securities, which is obviously lower this quarter, how that affects the 4Q run rate for net interest income? Yeah. So, first, let me just say a couple of things here. We were very opportunistic this quarter. Interest rates in fixed income securities are, again, I would say, record lows again or multi-decade lows. So, given the acquisition that we're pending to get approvals from on the Scotia and the fact that the value of that transaction is $3.8 billion  of our (00:14:34) core low-yielding, low-cost deposits, it make a heck of a lot of sense for us to just not have to rely on broker CDs and wholesale funding that are a lot more expensive. So, we don't need to have that expensive funding. So, that's the first thing. We took advantage of that and we know it's going to have a little bit of a short-term impact, but the transaction expected to close in the fourth quarter, we're really managing the bank for the longer term, Brett, and not necessarily for the fourth quarter. So, if  it has (00:15:13) a little bit of a reduction in interest income into the fourth quarter because of the sale of the securities, we take it and we move forward, because the added value comes in with the acquisition. Secondly, on the NPL sales, look, we are getting rid of capital that was not well used, and what we are seeing is interest from the US, capital coming into the island, interested in buying this, we're seeing a better bid. And again, we were pretty good in the quarter at getting this transactions firmed up. And we're excited to get rid of those assets. We'll be able to reduce our operating expenses on that sale alone at the tune of $1.5 million to $2 million, simply because we won't have to work out quite a few residential and small commercial loans. So, again, those were non – they didn't impact interest income, because they were basically not generating any interest income for us, but it clearly cleans up a lot of unnecessary work and dedicate our resources to what we're here for, and what we're here for is to grow. And this acquisition with – the acquisition of Scotiabank, Puerto Rico and USVI gives us tremendous potential and tremendous momentum for us to grow and take advantage of how the economy is transitioning to a new phase here in Puerto Rico. Okay. And if I could sneak in one last one just on Scotia, how that review process is going. I know you're looking for regulatory approval. Can you give us any update on the timing of the transaction? No, there's not much I can add. Regulators are engaged with us and we're engaged with them. And they'll have to go through their process. We are conscious that the level of information sharing is active and real-time, and we're confident that by the end of the year, we should have a positive response on the approvals. Okay. Appreciate all the color. Thank you, Brett. Have a good day. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Twerdahl of Sandler O'Neill. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Alex. Hey. Just to clarify on the last question there, you said that you're reasonably confident that you'll get regulatory approval by the end of the year. Are you also confident the deal will close by the end of the year? Both yes. Okay. Just clarifying there. And then, just wanted to ask a little bit more on the loan growth numbers that we saw this quarter. We saw loans go down a little bit. But I think they're probably impacted by the loan sales. So, maybe you can just give us sort of some color and help us  discern (00:18:23) a little bit more on sort of what the organic core... Yeah. ...loan growth looked like during the quarter and then also kind of how your pipelines are looking into the end of the year and into 2020? Yeah. So, you're absolutely correct. Even though you see loan balances going down, they're primarily impacted by two areas. One is the runoff of the acquired book, but more importantly, the sale of the NPLs. So, if you look at it ex the NPL sales, our loan – we had loan growth. So, what we're seeing into the fourth quarter, we're seeing a good pipeline still, we see on the commercial small and middle market commercial business, we see a good pipeline. We continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing on auto lending. We're seeing a slight improvement in mortgage lending also, consumer lending remains steady. We had a good quarter again this third quarter with $48 million in originations on the consumer side. So, what we're seeing is a good momentum into the fourth quarter. And again, we're working on many work streams right now as we are planning the closing and the integration of Scotiabank, so we have our hands full. But having said that, our teams continue to be very focused on generating the business and executing on our plan on the fourth quarter. Okay. Cool. And then, just talking about the provision a little bit going into next year, first off, I really appreciate the color you've given on CECL and sort of the day one impact to the reserve. How should we think about the reserve and the provisioning into 2020 with CECL, as well as you had this little adjustment due to some macro factors in Puerto Rico this quarter? How should we be kind of thinking about the like, one, a good starting point for the reserve or the provision for starting at the beginning of next year; and then, two, how that is actually going to be impacted by CECL? So, before I pass it Maritza, I just want to say a little bit big picture and I mentioned it earlier when Brett asked us the question, it's a little hard for us to be able to give you more color on the provisioning next year, simply because we're in the midst of closing an acquisition, so that will have its own intricacies. But from a macro perspective, our expectation is that credit trends will continue to move in the right direction and therefore, that should have a somewhat of an impact throughout the year. I don't know if Maritza has any additional color  (00:21:13). No, again, maybe to close this comment (00:21:15), we have been focusing in having the model ready for day one and we share with you the day one impact. And at this moment, it's too early for us to add some color on how they too will impact  the rerun (00:21:30) levels of provisioning. But as José mentioned, we will be working with that and soon as we have some information, we will share with you. Okay. And then, just a final question, can you just help me sort of  jive (00:21:45) the NPL sales kind of – what was the mark on the loans? I saw that there's $29 million of mortgages and $9 million of commercial NPLs that were sold. How can we get that back to the $95 million in unpaid principal balance? Good luck with that, Alex. Yeah. In general, Alex, at this time, we won't share any pricing for competitive reason, but the figures are there and we felt these levels of pricing that we get are far better than what we saw before  (00:22:19) Yeah. But again, as Maritza mentioned, we're happy with the pricing we've got and better than what we got pre Maria and better than we saw in the last 12 months for sure, but we really don't want to be sharing too much specifics there in terms of the pricing. Can you share with us kind of how you determined which NPLs, you sold off about a third of them, if there are any common characteristics between them that made them particularly worth selling and whether or not we should expect further loan sales in the subsequent quarters? Yeah, yeah. Two – okay, you asked two questions, I'll give you two answers. The way we looked at it was, let's focus on residential, because they are small  $120,000, $115,000 (00:23:11) per loan. Let's focus on small commercial, because, again, those are more costly to work out than the bigger ones in terms of the operating side. So that's how we looked at it and they're all non-performing, non-accrual loans that were in bankruptcy some of them and we just had to kind of spend a lot of time on them and that's kind of what was the first driving force behind it, many of them were non-accrual, many of them were having cash flow challenges in their own businesses, so that's kind of where we came from. Number two, should we expect more sales, well, I don't know if you realize, but the level of NPLs that we have is quite low. And so, we do not expect to have any additional sales. We do feel that we've cleansed all these legacy NPLs from residential and small commercial particularly and we're good to go. So, again, opportunistic in the quarter and happy to get it done with additional liquidity coming into the market. Thank you for taking my questions. Yeah. You're welcome. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Gladue of Alden Securities. Good morning. Good morning, Joe. Let me start with, I guess, you talked about a little bit about the balance sheet going forward, but with – typically, you've run with  level of securities that maybe, I don't know, sub 10% (00:24:53) to 20% of total assets, it's well below there now. Do you think you'll be sort of drifting back towards that level after the Scotia acquisition or do you plan on running with a lower level of securities going forward? We're planning on having a lower level of securities going forward. Joe, our expectation is to be able to first deploy the cash to close and finalize the transaction and make the payment, but also our planning forward is for deploying into loans and have the ability to focus on our most important markets, the small commercial and middle market, commercial, auto. With the acquisition of Scotiabank, we'll have a lot more scale on the residential side. So, we'll be able to do a little bit more there too. So, it won't happen immediately, as you can imagine, but in our planning, the intention is not to extend duration on the fixed income securities market and better deploy it on the higher yielding loan bucket. Okay. All right. And again, you did discuss some of the loan outlook and pipeline and everything, just wonder if you could give a little more color on the US originations, looks like this was the lowest quarter since you started that program for originations. Is that because you've kind of reached the level you're comfortable with or is there anything else going on there? No. I mean, we've mentioned in the past, the US loan program continues to be an important and part of our strategies going forward. It has its ebbs and flows. So, some quarters, we'll do $12 million like this quarter, other, we'll do $40 million or $50 million. It just depends on what we see and again, we're being very prudent, very conservative. So, lots of things can come up  our alley (00:27:10), but we're not necessarily going after it. So, we're being very methodical. Okay (00:27:18). And that's why you'll see that ups and downs on a quarter-to-quarter basis. All right. Fair enough. And I guess I'll just ask if you could give, yeah, some color on the deposit pricing trends in the island and where you're expecting them to go? Well, with Federal Reserve Bank bringing down Fed funds twice this year, the expectation of one or two more cuts, I think any potential pressure to increase cost of funds in the past is certainly subsided. We still have excess liquidity here in the market in Puerto Rico. So that has been very helpful throughout this –  the ending – till (00:28:02) the higher rate cycle, now that we're back into a lower rate cycle and, of course, with the acquisition of Scotiabank, it gives us tremendous strategic benefits, because we really have a solid, core low-cost funding base with almost 500,000 clients. So, again, we don't foresee significant or any pressure going forward in terms of the cost of funds. There might be some competitive pressures in the local market trying to focus on us, which we are seeing, but we know how to play defense too. So, we don't expect that to affect us going forward, Joe. All right. Well, thank you. That's it for me. Yeah. Thank you, Joe. Have a good day. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Manna of KBW. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Glen. Good morning. I'm – I just wanted to follow up on Alex's question. I'm trying to kind of get into what was the organic loan growth rate. And I know, José, you said that it was – loans were up, but when I look at loans held for investment at period end versus the second quarter – third quarter versus second quarter, looks like they were down $97 million. How much of that $97 million drop was due to moving the loans to held-for-sale? So, Glen, part of the reason why we're not giving that number is because we're being very cautious with pricing in terms of the sales. So, again, we're using unpaid principal balance as the metric to disclose the sales, which was $95 million between acquired and originated loans. But in the end, when you see we have organic loan growth primarily from the auto originations, which was $140 million, we have around $30 million of repayments every month. So, you have an idea there, and the same with consumer, we had a very good quarter. And then, residential mortgage has been trending down because of repayments all along. So, again, commercial, small business, auto and consumer are the drivers for us to remain growing our core loan book in the numbers for this quarter. Well, so that's a thing, and I think what's kind of masking all of this is when you look at originations, and you back out the US loan program, OFG USA, originated loans on the island were actually up like 3.3% ... Yeah. ...quarter-over-quarter, which is pretty good, because the third quarter is usually a seasonally soft quarter for you guys? Yeah. Yeah. So, those are good numbers for us, too, so we're seeing 2% to 3% annual average growth in the loan portfolio when you look at it, and the run rate for this quarter was – when you look at it from an organic perspective, excluding the sales of the NPLs, it remains around 2% to 3%. Okay. And maybe just a little bit of color on, you sold some lower yielding securities, right now, it's in cash,  maybe you paid out (00:31:40) some broker deposits. What's the NIM trajectory here? Do you hold this level? Do you increase and kind of the impact of what's going on in the mainland in terms of the rate environment? Yeah. What... Go ahead. Go ahead. So, what we're seeing, Glen, is something similar what happened to us this third quarter that the Fed moved rates during July, so we have only a reduction of 3 basis point in the NIM. What we're seeing for this next quarter will be something very similar, we will see probably a slight reduction in the  (00:32:16) loans, but  we'll (00:32:18) compensate through the reduction in the wholesale funding. So that's how we see the NIM going forward, probably stable or going down 3, 4 basis point as we did this quarter. Okay. And I – refresh my memory, when you announced the Scotiabank deal, you were going to sell $1 billion of securities post-closing. Are the securities that were sold this quarter, is that inclusive of that amount, or should we expect $700 million in sales post-closing or is it still a $1 billion in sales post-closing? No, no. We were opportunistic, Glen, in the quarter when we saw interest rates dropping. So, we kind of preempted that transaction that we announced when we announced the Scotia deal. So, we've done the sale. Once we do the closing, the investment securities that are carried from Scotia, we'll take a look at them, but they will carry in into our balance sheet. Okay. So, to answer your question, you know, we announced post-deal, but we did a pre-deal because of market conditions. Okay. But there's a pretty significant difference in the amount, right, $330 million this quarter and then it was $1 billion, I think, when you announced it, right, when you announced the deal? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, remember, last quarter, we also sold securities. Okay. So that adds a little bit more. So, there's not much of a difference, maybe $200 million difference and that we're building cash. So, if we don't need to sell, we don't need to sell. Okay. And just, I know, in a quarter, where you have these kinds of adjustments and things moving around, the tax rate can flip around a lot. I think, Maritza, you had said last quarter you expected a second half tax rate of around 32%, it was 26% this quarter. Where do you expect that to go? Well, the effective tax rate for the year is estimated at 30.15%, and it's basically the changes, the mix of this transaction, because we have higher proportion of  spend income (00:34:27) versus taxable income and that's why it gets reduced from the original expectations. So, 30% more or less going forward. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Glen. Have a good day. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray. Hey. I just want to follow up on two things. One, just want to make sure I understood the pro forma liquidity or the – when we close the deal, how much liquidity you're anticipating having on the balance sheet? So, given the transactions that we did this quarter and the past quarter, we expect to have the same level of liquidity that we announced, it's just that we preempted the sale of securities in this quarter and the previous quarter. So, no – there are no different expectations there. (00:35:45). Okay. I just want to be clear on that. And then, José Rafael, can you just talk about for a second when I look at the commercial loan production, I mean that's kind of trended – obviously, 2Q last year was kind of a different quarter, but the numbers have kind of moved down a little bit over the past year and I'm just curious if you can give any color if that's a function of activity or you're just seeing heightened competition from your peers. I know you want to become the lender of choice to the SME market in Puerto Rico. Can you give us any color on  kind of the production trends on (00:36:20) commercial? Yeah, actually, the production trends this year in the small commercial are a lot better than last year. Actually, we're very happy with the small business, commercial lending business this year. What's pushing the comparisons in somewhat of a negative way is the larger ticket items and there, you have more competition and that's kind of where we are. Having said that, we do have seen also the postponement of some transactions that are in the pipeline and we expected to close this quarter, maybe they close in the fourth quarter  or (00:37:11) maybe they're pushed into the first quarter of 2020, but they are still live transactions and significant ones. So, all in all, I think the way we have transformed the retail channel and the way we have focused on the small commercial client is starting to pay off in a more consistent basis and we're extremely happy with the performance on that sector and looking forward to build on it once we do the acquisition and into 2020. Okay, great. Appreciate the additional color. Yeah. Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fernández for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, operator. Thank you to all for listening in today and I wish you a good Monday and a great week. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

         "Good day and welcome to the ServisFirst Bancshares Incorporated Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Davis Mange, Investor Relations for ServisFirst Bank. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We will have Tom Broughton, our CEO; and Bud Foshee, our CFO, covering some highlights from the quarter, and we will then take your questions. I'll now cover our forward-looking statements disclosure and then we can get started. Some of the discussion in today's earnings call may include forward-looking statements, subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from any projections shared today due to factors described in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and ServisFirst assumes no duty to update them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thank you. Thank you, Davis, and good afternoon to everybody. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to mention we elected a new Director today, Chris Mettler. Chris Mettler has been on our Charleston board of directors. He has a technology background and we're thrilled to have Chris as a new Director of the company. So, we think he'll be a really a great asset for the bank and in the holding company as well. So well, welcome to Chris and thank you for joining us. In regards to the quarter, we were very pleased all in all, of knowing we didn't like, we had a little bit of margin slippage. It was unexpected. And Bud's going to talk about our plans to bring it back up to the 350-basis point range. So, that's something we're working on. And I'll mention that later, the flexibility we have given our strong deposit growth. The loan growth in the third quarter was modest. Our best growth was in Nashville and West Florida. The Birmingham region had some CRE paydowns that affected growth in the quarter, plus, we didn't have any large loan closings in the quarter. The loans are up 10% year-over-year. We do have – tend to have lumpiness. Last quarter, we had tremendous loan growth. This quarter, it's just lumpy, and that's all I can tell you, is if you ask about the economic outlook and somebody always ask every call, it does seem that clients are more cautious given the trade war with China and the media focus on the economy. And I thought about it, we really hadn't gotten many requests to finance new boats and airplanes lately. So that tends to be a sign that people are being a little bit on the cautious side. Our pipeline is up a good bit over the last quarter. Even then, we have a much higher projected pay-offs in the fourth quarter than normal and it is around several projects. They're not CRE projects. They're medical projects. They're going to bond financing. So, the flip side of lower interest rates is people can go to permanent market with some things that they can't do when rates are higher. So, good for our clients that some of those projects will be back – most of those projects will be back, build a new project, they'll start construction on. So, we typically have good closings in the fourth quarter and we expect that there's no reason we don't expect the same this year. We did add six new bankers in the third quarter. We had a great team in Charleston, three bankers and one each at three Florida cities. So, we hired 20 new bankers year-to-date, just an outstanding group of people, of new bankers. Excluding trainees, we have 139 bankers total today. We're really proud of the new people we've added this year. We've had substantial upgrades in staff this year but the numbers don't reflect the people that we've added this year. They certainly will in 2020 and 2021, and we've added significant new overhead for these new hires. I mentioned earlier, we do have a very strong deposit growth, is 17% annualized for the quarter and 19% year over year. The growth was very broad based this quarter, with 7 of our 10 regions having outstanding deposit growth. We do have a lot of flexibility to manage our margin, unlike many other banks. We've never accepted broker deposits or used a listing service and we have never had a Federal Home Loan Bank advances. So, we have substantial excess liquidity. We've been trying to manage it down, but it is a bit of a champagne problem and that's a good thing to have. One new initiative Bud is going to talk about for 2020, it'd be expense control is something we've never focused on, but we think it's a good time to do so. We will limit hiring to revenue production personnel in 2020. So, we're also going to look at expense control and vendor cost and look at it – at all of our fees and cost-providing services to our clients. So, I'll now turn it over to Bud to get into more detail on the numbers. Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon. Net interest margin did decrease in the third quarter. It went from 3.44% in the second quarter to 3.36% in the third quarter. Couple of factors. Average excess funds increased by $269 million in the third quarter. Also, LIBOR-based loans, 30-day LIBOR, we have $879 million in loans tied to that index. That rate is moving ahead of Fed rate cuts. It decreased 17 basis points from June 30 to August 1, decreased 19 basis points from August 2 to September 18 and has since decreased by 15 basis points. On a positive note, with lower deposit rates after the Fed cut rates in July and September, the cost of our interest-bearing DDAs is 1.71% in July, decreased to 1.57% in August, lowered again to 1.49% in September and our estimate for October is 1.32%. For October, we see an improvement in margin of $250,000 to $275,000. That will be a 3 to 4-basis-point increase at our margin. I have detail on the different components, if anyone who would like for me to email that to you. Also, just as we add $50 million in loans, that will add 2 basis points to our margin also. The ALCO committee will meet on October 23 and will develop a plan to cut deposit rates both with and without a Fed rate cut at end of the month. A reminder, we have no accretion income related to acquisitions. Non-interest income, our credit card income continues to grow, $1.2 million year-to-date increase, and quarter-over-quarter 2019 versus 2018, we increased $454,000. Earlier this year, the bank received an endorsement from American Bankers Association for our Correspondent Bank Agent Credit Card Program, and we've added 16 banks to this program in 2019. Our mortgage banking income grew $899,000 year-to-date, and quarter-over-quarter 2019 versus 2018, it increased $656,000. In early October, the bank purchased $75 million of bank-owned life insurance. The tax equivalent yield on that insurance is 4.77%. A reminder, we do not sell any government guaranteed loans to generate non-interest income. Non-interest expense – we increased our third quarter incentive accrual by $500,000 based on anticipated year-end payouts to new lending teams we've added in 2019. And Tom mentioned we would have a new budgeting plan for 2020, a zero-based budgeting plan. This is not a traditional cost cutting plan, first, to justify what expenses to keep versus what to remove; second, you consider activities that should be or shouldn't be performed and how they should be performed. One area that we see improved efficiencies in is our wire processing area; and last, budgeting is not connected to prior year spending. It's based on necessary activities. Loan loss provision, our third quarter net charge-offs were $8.8 million. $6.2 million we impaired. Unimpaired charge-offs were $2.6 million. We've been proactive on our larger problem credits. Our Chief Credit Officer, Henry Abbott, is on the call and he can answer any credit-related questions. The bank participated in a State of Alabama-operated loan guarantee program. This program was terminated in the third quarter. Alabama State Banking Department notified us that this was effective July 31. At that time, we had 76 loans enrolled in the program, consisting of roughly $53 million in total loans. ServisFirst is losing $22 million in loan guarantees in favor of a onetime payment of $7.4 million. Management decided to book this $7.4 million to loan loss reserve and this was based on potential credit downgrades over the life of this loan portfolio. In general, loans that had a collateral shortfall and other enhanced risk were enrolled in the program. It required a 1% fee on the commitment. These were loans that would have otherwise not met the bank's lending criteria. Thus, the credited enhancement enticed the bank to land in this situation. Taxes, year-to-date tax rate for 2019 is 20.2%, 21.04% without stock option credits of $1.2 million. The tax rate for 2018 was 18.9%, is 20.9% without stock option credits of $2.4 million. Third quarter rate 2019 was 20.2%, 20.7% without stock option credits of $231,000. Third quarter of 2018, the rate was 19%, 20.3% without stock option credits of $539,000. For the remainder of 2019, projected tax rate is 21.3%. Shareholder value, book value, excluding unrealized gain on AFS securities, is up 16% year-over-year, and book value, including the unrealized gain, is up 19% year-over-year. This concludes my comments. And I will turn the program back over to Tom. Thank you, Bud. We certainly, from an economic outlook standpoint, we don't see a recession on the rise, but obviously, that's all the focus is, it seems to be, from certainly, the media. I thought if there's a recession coming, we're well prepared for a recession. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have very strong profitability. I've always – I've argued with the regulators over the years. Regulators argued that capital is the best defense against losses, and I've always argued that's not true. The best defense against loss is to have a strong stream of income to offset any potential losses. Our non-performing assets, our balance sheet and our credit quality is pristine. Our non-performing assets are 0.5% to 1% of assets. So we like where we are, if we see a recession – there's a recession coming, we're as well prepared as any bank in the United States. So with that, we'll open it up for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today will come from Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Tyler. Hey, Tyler. How are you doing? Good. How are you, guys? Good. Thanks. Good. Hey, maybe Bud, let's start on the margin. So the 3-basis point to 4-basis point increase and you said the different components that you could e-mail us, could we just walk through that on the line here and how you expect to get that 3-basis point to 4-basis point increase in margin, particularly given fourth quarter that's usually a seasonally high liquidity build? And I appreciate the commentary on the deposit cost, but if you could just go over that, I think you said a 1.32% interest bearing cost for October is what you expect. So, a pretty sizable step down. Did I hear that correctly? Right – no, that's interest-bearing DDAs. It does not include CDs, but yeah, a big decrease. It was 1.49% September, then after all the rate cuts, we're estimating 1.32% in October. I mean, you've got – let's see, you got prime loans that rate price immediate. That's about $1.35 billion. Prime loans are reset once a month. That's $488 million. Our excess funds have decreased so far in October, so that definitely has a positive impact on earnings. Fed funds purchase, of course, we've lowered that rate when Fed cut rates in September. Don't know how much detail you guys want for each component, and so what current when the loans reset, because you have to really go through like on the prime loans that reset once a month or 30-day LIBOR kind of going through when those would reset in October and then calculating that impact on the margin. Right. But if we do get an October cut, you would still expect that basis point improvement for the fourth quarter? Yeah, because like when we have our ALCO meeting on Wednesday, we'll have a plan to cut rates even with or without a Fed rate cut. It's just something we've got to address. Like Tom said, we really didn't cut enough back in July and we did a much deeper cut in September after the Fed cut on the 18th. Okay. Do you have... It's really – I mean, the excess fund is really the key. I mean, it's – that is decreasing and that's kind of what's – when it goes up $269 million in the third quarter, we didn't forecast that and that has a big impact on your margin. Right. But isn't seasonally fourth quarter pretty high from a liquidity standpoint, if I go back the last several years? Would you expect something different for this year? Well, I guess what we would anticipate probably is higher loan growth. I mean, I think that's traditionally higher loan and that's – if you look at where we are from a budget standpoint, we're well behind on loans. So, I think we'll have a stronger fourth quarter from a loan growth standpoint. Okay. This is for – I mean, based on historical data, we... Yeah. ...we deem to loan growth. Just last for me on the margin, do you have what the 9/30 total or September 30 total deposit cost was? Yeah. Total was 1.12% for total cost. Okay. Got it. And then, maybe just shifting gears over to credit, a couple of questions there. So, the $14 million increase in the non-accruals, can you just talk about how many loans, what type of loans were included in that increase? And then, on the $22 million of loans that you lost the guarantee, what was the status of those loans from a credit rating standpoint at this point at 9/30? Yeah. Henry Abbott is our Chief Credit. He's going to talk about those components, if that's okay. Yeah. And I'll hit the loan loss guarantee program question first. The status of that pool was, as Bud mentioned, those were typically, I guess, I'd say collateral light loans, but to date, our loan loss on that pool have been very minimal and all of the loans were current at the end of – well, I guess all but one relationship was current at the end of the quarter, but other than that, all loans were current, except for one relationship. The primary driver and the increase in non-accruals, of the increase, roughly $10 million was associated with one credit that is a rural hospital system out of our national market and that was the primary driver of the jump in non-accrual. Okay. And then, just lastly for me, just on the FDIC credit, just to make sure I'm clear, so the $1.7 million credit you got this quarter, would you expect the run rate of that in the fourth quarter and go forward to flip back towards kind of your historical FDIC insurance expense? Right. It will. Yeah. From what we gather, that will be a normal expense, I guess you would say, in the fourth quarter  (00:19:54). Okay. Tyler, it's very confusing – this is Tom – we've gotten some – the indication we got from, look, really primarily from the American Bankers Association is that you could expect a credit for the fourth quarter equal to half of what you got in the third quarter. So that's – I don't understand why there can't be more specificity around this number, but nevertheless, that's – maybe you can find out. Well, we can't seem to find out a lot. It's a moving target. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks. Thanks, guys. That's it for me. And even if we do have excess liquidity build in the fourth quarter, you can assume that from a margin standpoint, it'll neither add to or take away from earnings, it'll be revenue neutral. So, hopefully. Our next question will come from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey. Good evening, guys. Hey, Brad. Hey, Brad. How are you doing? Good, good. Bud, appreciate all the color on the NIM. Maybe just want to talk about the other side of the balance sheet. Loan yields, I guess, were down 6 basis points or so linked quarter. Just kind of curious if that would be kind of what you might expect in the third quarter. And then, maybe if we also get an October cut and just kind of how that compares to kind of what new loan yields are as they come on the books. And then, to the extent you guys have loan floors, how might that protect you? Yeah. Let me talk about floors first. We have $1.4 billion – of the floating rate, we got $3.1 billion in floating rate loans, variable rate loans. $1.4 million (sic) [$1.4 billion] has floor ... Billion. Billion, sorry, billion, 46%. Rate floor – well, the loan rate equal to floor rate at end of September, that increased to $518 million. It was $265 million at end of June. So with two Fed rate cuts, that had a big impact. The – let's see – let me look at the loan yields went down a little bit in September. Some had to do with a couple of lower rate credits, just had a lower loan yield because it was 5.16% in July, 5.19% in August, 4.81% in September. But  I said (00:22:45) like 5.10% to 5.15% are our normal run rate on new loans. Not accrual affected – not accrual status on the rural healthcare credits are the primary reason for the drop in the loan yield. Yeah. We had a cut – we had some non-accrual reversals in the third quarter. Got it. Got it. And you said 46% of the loans that have floors are at the floor. Is that what I heard? No. 46% of our variable rate portfolio has a floor rate. Okay. Got it. And then, it was $500-some-odd million... Yeah. $518 million is at the floor rate at the end of September. Okay. All right. Great. And then, just to follow-up here on expenses, I know you guys are probably in the budget process right now. Last couple of years, you guys have kind of been up high-single digits, tracking maybe closer to double-digits this year. I know it's early but is this something that you think you can kind of hold to kind of mid-single digit growth in 2020 or you guys are really efficient. So is there much room to cut, so to speak, or pull back? Yeah. Brad, we're going to look hard at every expense and we're looking hard at our vendors. We're going to ask every vendor to partner with us and help us try to pay our expenses. So, we think it's an achievable, very capable goal, Brad. Certainly, we're – continue to look at adding revenue production personnel like we always have. We added a lot this year. We've added – again, the 20 people we've added is significant new overhead but we think they'll pay off for us next year 2020. So, we would like to draw the line on overhead and try to have a really good year, because if we're not satisfied with where we are this year, this is not our standard of performance. So, we're certainly not satisfied and we're sending the message throughout our company that this is not satisfactory performance. And typically, you guys have an adjustment in the fourth quarter, particularly on personnel. I mean, it sounds like you got a pretty full accrual in the third quarter. Does that take a step back into fourth as you kind of true things up? Well, we hope we pay out more than we've got accrued, Brad. That'll be good news if we do. But certainly, management bonus accruals are going to be down from last year, to tell you that, because we just haven't had that kind of the year that we want to have. Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Fitzsimmons with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Good evening. Hey, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Just a follow-up on Brad's question, I just wanted to make sure I heard it right. I thought when you were initially describing the cost cutting focus, was that you were going to hold off on new hires. You were going to – but then I thought I just heard you say you were going to continue with hiring of revenue producers. So just wanted to clarify that, number one. Yeah. I mean, we'll continue to hire revenue production people, Kevin. But certainly, they're going need to be – there going to need to be slam dunks. They're going to need to pay for themselves very quickly. How about that. And Tom, what is that focus, say, about your willingness to look at new markets? And is it make it less likely, you would be entering a new market by entering a – hiring a team or is it, it just depends what falls in your lap? Yeah. I mean we look – we talk to people all the time. I mean, we talk to people at least monthly to go to a group somewhere. So, we're certainly not going to rule-out expansion to a new market at all. They're not – there is a point they're not – they don't have a bigger bet on us in terms of – the most part, we open new market, our start-up losses are going to be, over an 18-month period, about $2 million. I don't think that's going to make us or break us. I don't mean to minimize $2 million, but certainly, we're open to new opportunities as we always have them. But we certainly have more of a laser focus on, we need immediate profitability more quickly and we want our managers to make – to rationalize their resources. So, they need to do with what they've got. If they want to bring on somebody new, then we need to rationalize the resources we have on hand today. Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then, just on the whole decision process of looking at cost cuts and with this increased focus, is it more due to the lower margin environment we're dealing or is it more looking ahead at potentially? I know you said you feel very good about credit, but is it more to be prepared if we have a downturn or is it a little of both? No, we're not getting ready for recession in that respect. It's just the – it's a reaction to the kind of year we've had, which is – this year has not been a double-digit earnings increase and that's the kind of year we expect and we're going – it broadly sends a pretty good message to everybody that this is not acceptable, this is not acceptable performance, and that's purely a reaction to that, Kevin. Got it. Great. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from William Wallace with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call, guys. I was hoping maybe we could dig in a little bit more on credit. So, first off, on the – you mentioned there was a $10 million hospital facility, I believe you said, in Nashville that drove the third quarter increase. Yes. It's out of our Nashville office, yes. That's the primary driver in non-accrual. It is the same credit we've been talking about for a while and it was the – it was going to be a liquidation sale of assets, and then, we've gotten in a scrape with unsecured creditors who hired a lawyer from New Jersey to represent them. So, we're fighting over the money. There's a pot of money. We just can't get to it until we have some final resolution through the bankruptcy judge. But go ahead, Wally... Was there a charge-off associated with this last year in the third quarter? Last year in the third quarter? Yeah. No. No. No. Yeah. Okay. We had a charge this quarter. Okay. So, what was the charge this quarter for that credit? Go ahead. Charge associated with that in this credit this quarter was roughly $2 million. And then, last year, in the fourth quarter, your non-accruals jumped up a little over $10 million, and then, they kind of sat. So, it just feels like they're kind of coming in and then sitting. Was that one credit last quarter or was that a couple of credits, and can you talk about why it feels like they're sitting or is it just that they've moved off and others have come on? I don't remember specifically the fourth quarter. I'll have to follow-up on that. I think it's a combination of both. I mean, we are being proactive and removing credit. I mean, for instance, one of the drivers of the increase in net charge-offs was we sold a loan that had been on non-accrual for quite some time and we did take up a loss on it but we had very impaired to almost what our loss was but we just felt like we needed to sell it, and that was roughly 30% of our net charge-offs for that quarter. So, I mean, I do think we're actively working on through the cycle, if that's what your question was. There is a C&I credit that is pretty good. The next largest one is a C&I credit that'll be – we should have some resolution on starting this week. But it's been going through bankruptcy process. We say –  (00:31:40) filing bankruptcy takes forever, Wally. Understood. I guess the reason I'm just digging in is because last year third quarter, your non-accrual loans were just over $9 million, and now, we're approaching $36 million. And I understand that your NPAs are still relatively low but that's a pretty big jump in four quarters. So, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether we're seeing any increase in inflows or anything outside of just a couple of one-offs or larger credits that are going bad. So, I know your commentary is always that you're not seeing any signs of stress in the system. So, I'm just trying to get a sense as why the big jump over four quarter. Yeah. I mean, like you said, roughly $10 million of that was one credit we moved this quarter. And Tom mentioned our second largest NPA is one we're hoping to get some additional resolution through bankruptcy that we get some paydowns on that credit... Okay. All right. And you mentioned, Tom, that there was one that moved off in the third quarter as well. This is Henry Abbott. And yeah, I did mention we sold the credit until it reduced non-accruals accordingly this – in the third quarter. By how much? It was assisted living facility, Wally. Roughly, it was a $5 million credit and we had it roughly impaired by half and that was close to what we sold the debt for. So, that reduced  not closed (00:33:22) by $2.5 million. Is that what you're saying? Net, yes. Okay. We had an impaired for half. Okay. All right. And then, you had, if I understand correctly, you received a $7.4 million payment to – in the guaranteed program and you applied that entire $7.4 million to the reserves balance due to provision expense? Yes, correct. Is that – okay. So... And actually, one of our non-accrual loans is in that pool with this – the one credit that has some pretty serious issue with it, but we will obviously identify that. I'm looking at – I've gone looking at the non-performing asset list at September 30 and I don't see anything on here that wasn't a non-accrual last year, Wally. Okay. If there is, they're small, is what I'm saying. There might be something for $250,000. But things aren't setting. No, there's not anything. We move – the good thing about seeing our credits, when they get in trouble fast, they get out of trouble. They resolve themselves fairly quickly. We found out during the recession that some of those real estate deals just take – they just are like a  TARP (00:34:39), they just stay forever on the books. Yeah. You can't get rid of them. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. So on the provision expense, had you not moved that payment into your reserve, you would've had a negative provision expense, so you would have been releasing reserves pretty substantially? Yeah. We would have. So, what would have been driving that release? Are you changing your – any assumptions in the past five model? Well, we got this payment. Payment was not completely a bad thing. It's $7.4 million that we received. Okay. So, there's no changes or anything on the assumptions in the underlying model? No. I mean, you had lower loan growth. Is that what you mean? Didn't have to provide that much for loan growth, stuff like that? Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense of... Yeah. (00:35:41) That would definitely have had an impact on what we put in the reserve for the quarter. Okay. Okay. And one last question on the FDIC reimbursement, do you – some banks have told us that they think there's going to be some reimbursement in the first quarter as well. Is that consistent with what you heard or know – or do you not know? We've heard different stories. We're going to  (00:36:08). Okay. (00:36:09) – I asked about what you gotten in the third quarter, you'll get in the fourth quarter, and that should be it, according to them, but I heard – yes, there's quite such a mystery. I don't know, Wally. Yeah. It's really confusing when the fund gets to a certain level, what they do. I just – we'll wait until to get it and then we'll book it. Yeah. Frankly, I don't want to have a credit. I'd rather just people keep paying it to reduce rate. If you think about it, the banks that – I don't want to have people not have make payments, but people do. The banks that get  (00:36:42), they need to be making the payment all the way up to when they fail. So, I'd rather solve this by paying it at reduced rate, but they didn't. Yeah. The FDIC did not ask my opinion. Fair enough. Fair enough. I've taken your time up. I appreciate it. Thanks for the commentary and color on some of the moving parts of the non-accrual bucket. I appreciate it. Thank you, Wally. At this time, there are no further questions in the question queue. And this will conclude today's question-and-answer session, as well as today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect."

         "Q3 2019 Earnings Call",
         "Good morning and thank you for joining Bank of Marin Bancorp's Earnings Call for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2019. I'm Andrea Henderson, Director of Marketing for Bank of Marin. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the call, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 21, 2019. Joining us on the call today are Russ Colombo, President and CEO and Tani Girton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings press release, which we issued this morning, can be found on our website at bankofmarin.com where this call is also being webcast. Before we get started, I want to emphasize that the discussion on this call is based on information we know as of today, October 21, 2019, and may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the forward-looking statements disclosure in our earnings press release, as well as our SEC filings. Following our prepared remarks, Russ and Tani will be available to answer your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Russ Colombo. Thank you, Andrea. Good morning and welcome to the call. By any measure, our third quarter performance was once again excellent. We produced strong deposits and loan growth while maintaining exceptional credit quality. These results demonstrate the success of our organic growth and initiatives and are disciplined in the way we operate. The investments we made in banking talent are driving consistent loan growth and enhancing our reputation across the footprint. Our business development activity is strong across our Bay Area markets, Marin, Sonoma, Napa, the East Bay and San Francisco, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities to fuel continued growth. Now I'll walk you through some of the highlights of the third quarter. Net income was $9.4 million, up from $8.2 million in the second quarter and $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2018. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $0.60 last quarter and $0.62 in the year ago quarter after adjusting for the two for one stock split last November. Loan originations increased to $77 million in the quarter from $53 million a year ago, this drove $33.8 million of loan growth for the quarter resulting in total loans of $1.8 billion at September 30. Deposits increased $122.5 million in the third quarter primarily due to normal cash fluctuations in some of our large business accounts, and total deposits were $2.22 billion at quarter-end. At September 30, non-interest bearing deposits accounted for 50% of total deposits, and our cost of deposits remained very low at only 21 basis points for the quarter. We have been at or near these levels since the beginning of 2018, making our deposit franchise one of the strongest among our peers. Our credit quality remains excellent. Non-accrual loans declined to only 0.02% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, which was down 1 basis point from the prior quarter. We recorded a $400,000 provision for loan losses in the quarter, which is in line with our loan growth. Recognizing the bank's continued solid performance, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share payable on November 8, 2019. This represents a 30% payout ratio and a 2% dividend yield based on our September 30, 2019 share price. Now, let me turn it over to Tani for additional insight on our financial results. Thank you, Russ. Good morning. As Russ mentioned Bank of Marin delivered another quarter of strong performance with earnings of $9.4 million. Earnings increased $1.2 million or 15% over the second quarter of 2019 and $768,000 over the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date earnings of $25.2 million translate into a return on assets of 1.33% and return on equity of 10.4%. In addition to solid loan and deposit growth there were two items that benefited net income in the third quarter. One a $562,000 bank-owned-life insurance or BOLI benefit and two, a $327,000 tax adjustment related to the true-up of our deferred tax liability. Taken together, these items accounted for $0.06 per share of net income and without them return on assets and return on equity for the quarter would have been 1.35% and 10.28% respectively. Net interest income of $24.2 million was up $362,000 from last quarter and up $612,000 from third quarter 2018. The increase from last quarter was largely due to interest recovery on our land development loan. This recovery combined with higher average loan balances and higher yields across interest earning categories account us for the year-over-year increase in net interest income and was only partially offset by higher rates on deposits. The tax equivalent net interest margin of 4.04% was unchanged from the second quarter and up 7 basis points from the year ago quarter. The 7 basis point increase over third quarter of last year, as well as the 12 basis point year-to-date increase over 2018 were both due to higher interest rates and loan growth. Non-interest income was $2.7 million, an increase of more than $400,000 from both the second quarter 2019 and the third quarter 2018. The increase was due to the BOLI benefit I mentioned earlier. Year-to-date non-interest income was up by a smaller amount due to the underwriting costs on new BOLI policies purchased earlier this year and lower deposit network income in 2019. Non-interest expense in the third quarter decreased by $716,000 to $14.2 million from the second quarter primarily due to severance paid in the second quarter and increased deferred costs associated with higher loan originations in the third quarter. Importantly, we completed our transition to an enhanced digital platform in the third quarter. As a result we're no longer absorbing the added costs that come from running two digital banking platforms in parallel. In addition last quarter's FDIC assessment was reversed in the third quarter since the insurance fund was above its required reserve ratio. For the first nine-months of the year non-interest expense was up less than $100,000 from last year, the modest increase coupled with revenue growth resulted in an efficiency ratio of 56.8%, which is a testament to our ongoing focus on expense control. In conclusion, our strong operating fundamentals, excellent credit quality, steady balance sheet growth and prudent expense management should continue to position Bank of Marin for long-term success. Now, Russ would like to share some closing comments. Thank you, Tani. We are optimistic about the balance of the year based on our strong performance in the third quarter, which is a direct reflection of our consistent business practices. We're gaining traction in all of our key markets and our team is successfully winning new business. We have an exceptionally strong base of low cost, non-interest-bearing deposits that should allow us to deliver consistent performance in any interest rate environment. We're disciplined in our underwriting and our focus will always be on building long-term customer relationships based on service and market expertise. Before I open up the call to questions, I want to comment on my plans to retire. As you may have seen, we recently announced that our board of directors has engaged Korn Ferry to conduct a search for my successor. No date has been set for my retirement and I plan to continue to serve as CEO until my successor is appointed and in place. It has been a privilege to lead Bank of Marin for more than 13 years and I'm committed to making sure that we have a smooth and successful transition. Thank you for your time this morning. And now, we'll open it up to answer your questions. Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed. Thanks. Good morning. Morning, Jeff. Question on the – just the expense line, it seems like you've got some moving pieces in there. I guess the first question would be, can we anticipate any further synergies or from the systems transition, I would assume also the FDIC reversal normalizes in the next quarter, but any thoughts on expense levels and ability to achieve any further synergies there? So, I think we've pretty much now gotten to steady state in terms of our conversion on the technology front and our core processing and digital platforms. And so, the third quarter expenses are indicative of the future on that line, of course there are lot of other expenses included in that data processing line besides the core processor and digital platform. But in general those synergies have all been recognized. With regards to the FDIC assessment, as long as the fund remains above the threshold we will not have to pay those assessments, but we have to wait for them to measure each quarter. Right. Right. Okay. So, a manageable level and modest growth from here is an okay estimate? I think I heard what – I think you said that growth just sort of normal growth from this point, is that what you said? Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that makes sense. We don't we don't typically have a spike in the fourth quarter in expenses for any particular reason. Yeah. There is no projects or otherwise that would indicate any increased expense levels. No new teams that we're hiring right now that will bump that. So, in the fourth quarter we expect it to be relatively normal in that respect. Okay. Thanks. And then on the margin, the interest recovery I was trying to get maybe to a core number if you had what  (00:12:35) reported, but what is the recovery add. And then I see the accretion tables have gone and maybe those have just been minimized, which is  the basis point or two (00:12:40) maybe immaterial but was there any significant change sequentially on due to accretion? No. Accretion actually we took the accretion table out of the release because both historically and currently there are not significant contributions from that. So, the comparisons are not meaningful and you saw I'm guessing that the amount of the interest recovery was $388,000 in the press release. Right.  (00:13:14) basis points I guess we could calculate that, but I just wanted to confirm the number? You know what let me get back to you offline on that one Jeff. I have that but... Okay. I'll step back. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. The next question comes from the line of Jacque Bohlen with KBW. Please proceed. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Good morning, Jacque. All right. Just looking to the deposit fluctuations and I know that this can be volatile given the customers that you have at the bank. But where there any temporary balances in there or is it all just normal seasonal fluctuations? Where they any what? Temporary balances. Oh I guess operating accounts are always temporary right because we have  (00:14:07) a number of large client – large deposit clients who – they're normal business. They have inflows of cash and outflows of cash, and you know I'll give an example of the type of business. We have a number of large you know contractors that do a lot of municipal state kind of work, building roads. And so, they'll bid on projects. If they win the project they get funded. The money comes in, sits there and as they – as they can do the construction it kind of filters out. And so, you have kind of money coming in and out at the same time from new projects. But you really can't project or predict the reliability of those deposits when they come in. That's just one example. And we have a lot of them like that. So, sometimes you have these big upswings, sometimes you have downswings, but if you look over history the deposit levels continue to grow pretty consistently over time. Okay. So, nothing – it's all very usual course of business. Nothing that you would anticipate a specific outflow going forward, just business as it goes. Nothing unusual. It will be outflows, but there also will be inflows as we go. Yes. Yes. Understood. And in terms of pricing now that we've had some of the rate cuts, I know that your deposit prices have been stable and have obviously performed very, very well as rates have increased. But just wondering if you've seen any sort of a change with the rate cuts and what you would anticipate going forward in terms of pricing on those? On the deposit side? Yeah. Are you talking about the deposit side or the loan side. Deposit side? The deposit side. Okay. I assume  (00:16:01) deposit side. Actually we still see certain banks who maybe don't have strong of a deposit base as us offering pretty high interest rates, kind of counter to the drop in rates because they're still having to fund their portfolio. So, we haven't seen that much of kind of backing off it's just kind of the usual suspects who are providing the high interest rates. We're pretty flushed though, so we don't have to compete, we try to – we – like we always say we try to be fair to our good clients, and we'll pay competitive interest rates to good clients, but we don't chase deposits with rates. On the other side of the ledger if you are going to follow (00:16:50), on the loan side there is incredible pressure from all sides on the interest rates on particularly in longer term financings, you've seen rates under 4% for 10 years, pretty consistently across the board from many, many banks. So, it's hard you have to pick and choose your balance so to speak. Okay. And that yes, I was asking about the deposits and was going to follow up on  (00:17:15) I apologize, I think my headset was having some issues. So... Hello? Can you hear me? Is anyone speaking? We can't hear anyone on the call. We don't hear anything. Yes.  (00:17:30) This is the operator. Jacque Bohlen, is speaking... Yeah. Jacque, I can hear you now. Okay. Sorry. I must be having technical difficulties. I'll step back and figure that out. Thank you guys. Thanks, Jacque. The next question comes from the line of Tim O'Brien with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed. Good morning Russ and Tani. Can you hear me? We can hear you fine, Tim. Thank you. Good morning, Tim. Oh, that's great. Glad. Just to follow-up a little bit more on the color you provided on loan pricing. Did you guys make accommodations on the pricing front in order to help support loan growth this quarter and if so could you give a little bit of color on what you might have done there and – that would be great. No, we haven't, if you're asking did we do very low interest rates to try and drive loan growth, the answer is, no. Do we compete with on good customers from time-to-time on more aggressive rate, sure from time-to-time, but we didn't do anything new, nothing different than we've done historically, Tim. So, you're not going to see this great swing of the net interest margin downwards because of it – it's a – it's pretty competitive out there, but we pick and choose what we're going to do, when we're going to do it. Yeah. And then in the first in your opening remarks Russ you just mentioned that your pipeline remains strong, so you're in that kind of bleeds into your optimism for the full year, so you're feeling pretty good about production opportunities in the fourth quarter I guess is that another way to translate that. Yes, we have a very strong pipeline. I would say that we are significantly higher pipeline today than we were this time last year. And how about at the end of – how about at the start of the third quarter, how does the pipeline compare sequentially? It's definitely up. We had you know the interesting thing about this quarter was that when I look at the – where the fundings came, it was across the board and I'll throw a couple of names out San Francisco, Napa, our Marin commercial banking office here in Novato, our office in Oakland, all of them did – had really good quarters, and they all have very good strong pipelines. We feel – one thing I would say I feel really good about the staffing that we have across our commercial banking offices. We have leadership in all the offices. We have you know as any bank does, we have a couple of openings for commercial bankers. But when you have good people in place and you have it staffed properly, you will see loan growth because these are – we have really good team. So, I'm very optimistic for the future because of the people we have in place. And then, I would imagine last question, you were coming into the planning season for banks for updated strategic planning and such. Can you give some general thoughts about I guess kind of how you are initially looking at 2020 relative to 2019? Do you – a more optimistic do you think you feel like it at this time this year relative to a year ago or you know what are your thoughts there? I'm still very optimistic. I think we're pretty disciplined about the way we operate. And we don't – as I've said many times before we don't stretch to do deals on structure, we maintain our discipline in how we do transactions and that shows up in our credit quality and that also shows up in our loan volume because of the disciplined approach we have and really building our pipelines and executing on that we've done really well. From the economy standpoint I feel okay, but it's always hard to judge what's going to happen, but in the Bay Area  (00:22:12) very strong economy as you know and I haven't seen big signs that we're going to have a big turn down in the next year. So, I'm very – I guess I would say I'm cautiously optimistic about the year ahead, kind of the same place I was a year ago. Okay, great. Well, thanks for answering my questions and congratulations on the quarter. Thank you, Tim. The next question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Hi, good morning. Good morning, Matthew. Morning. Do you happen to have the amount of interest recoveries in 2Q as well. I'm just trying to hone-in on the core NIM trend, ex-purchase accounting accretion and the recoveries? Yeah. Recovery on – recovery on interest item, no  (00:23:08) any interest recoveries in the second quarter. Yeah, Matthew, I think the number is zero  (00:23:17). (00:23:18) very small. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. And then can you speak to your plans for the excess cash liquidity. How should we think about the timing  (00:23:29) redeploying those proceeds? So, we take a liquidity into account as well as where the market is and since we've have had a little bit of a backup in the yield curve we're at a good point for purchasing right now. But it's really we have to – our primary objective in the investment portfolio is to make sure that we've got appropriate liquidity to account for the fluctuations in the deposit portfolio and to make sure that we have good buying opportunities. So, we continue to purchase investments. You know again, the same types of investments that we've always been purchasing, but we want to make sure that we do it at the right time given liquidity constraints and where the markets are. Okay. And then shifting gears to new business on the loan front, in terms of given what rates have done, can you give us a sense for the – where the weighted average rate is on new production. Just wondering if it's still above the portfolio yield or not? I don't think we share that typically. With the new volume, as I mentioned there's a lot of price pressure coming in on longer term transactions, but a good – good you know we're still – we're still gaining decent returns on our portfolio, but as you can imagine when you have – you have the environment we have, the interest rate environment  and that (00:25:04) we have longer term financings are being driven, rates have been driven down. And so, we are – in some of the longer deals we are seeing rates as I said we've seen rates in the three – in the high 3s, it's a little unnerving because it's tough to get a 4% NIM if you are  (00:25:29). So, we're holding a line. We do this for – we'll make exceptions for really good clients. But it's – every transaction is different and we evaluate not only the rate, but what else that customer has. Because if a customer comes in and they're asking for rates and  375 (00:25:53) range let's just say. But they have a lot of deposits and they have other business that we – then we make those adjustments. But if it's a kind of a one shot deal it's pretty hard to do that at that price. Just to add to what Russ... Okay, okay. ...I think and the margin shows that we are holding our own in terms of the new originations when we look at the rates that they came in over the last quarter. They were coming in on average pretty much at the portfolio rate. Okay. And then just last one from me on kind of reserving and provisioning the $4,000 of provisioning for growth on $34 million of net loan growth that implies the coverage ratio  (00:26:40) relative to your reserve in 90 basis points. Should we assume that reserve – reserve, your coverage ratios have largely bottomed from here I know it depends on mix in given quarter but... It depends, yeah. I guess you're probably right when you say it depends on mix. I can't say that it's bottomed. Our credit quality has been so good. And 90 basis points of total portfolio and we do have – we do have – we've made acquisitions, so obviously if you took the number – we have that number, but against the portfolio that is actually reserving for that number is higher, right. Because we have acquired portfolios were closer to 1% if you just supply the reserve  (00:27:34) against the portfolio that is reserved again and excluded the acquired portfolio it's from the acquisitions. So, it's – those numbers, I always question the calculation of reserve when it's actually against a different portion of the portfolio than the entire portfolio. So, I can't make a comment that it's the bottom because of the way that the calculation is done. Understood thanks. There appear to be no further questions on the telephone lines. Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone again for joining us this morning. And we look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. Thank you for calling in. Thank you. Thank you. Bye."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Cross First Q3 2019 earnings call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Director of Investor Relations, Matt Needham. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Welcome, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarterly earnings call as a publicly-traded company. On the call today are George Jones, President and CEO of CrossFirst Bankshares; Dave O'Toole, Chief Financial Officer of CrossFirst Bankshares; and Mike Maddox, President and CEO of CrossFirst Bank. As a reminder, a telephonic replay of this call and our earnings release will be available on our website for an extended period of time. Before we began, let me remind everyone on this call may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We caution investors that actual results may differ materially from the expectations indicated or implied in our forward-looking information. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I highly encourage you to review. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by applicable securities laws. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures have been included in the release and all earnings per share metrics discussed today are provided on a diluted earnings per share basis. I'd now like to turn the call over to George Jones. Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking everyone for their time this afternoon while we discuss our third quarter results. I'll take just a moment before we do that and tell you that in Dallas, we have a pretty significant tornado last night. And a lot of North Dallas was affected and a lot of damage fortunately as far as we can tell, there was no injuries and no deaths but there was some fairly severe damage in terms of structure. Fortunately, our location was quite a long way from that and we had absolutely no damage or no effect here at CrossFirst Bank in Dallas. We'll pray for the people that had a lot of damage in North Dallas. Thanks a lot. Again, we were excited to have such strong shareholders investing in our company despite the difficult market conditions we experienced during the initial public offering. I'm going to start this afternoon by covering a few key highlights for the quarter. Then Dave will provide additional detail on our financial results. And Mike will then go into more depth regarding our loan portfolio and credit to wrap up our prepared remarks prior to our Q&A session. As you've seen in our earnings release, our teams produced record results for the third quarter of 2019 and we are on track for the best year in the company's history. For the third quarter, we delivered net income of $10.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share and year-to-date net income of $29.2 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Year-to-date, we have achieved three times more net income from the same period in 2018. We continue to deliver strong, annualized, double-digit balance sheet growth and our year-to-date loan and deposit growth is already 19% and 14% respectively. Our financial results reflect again increased efficiencies, strengthened quarter-over-quarter earnings and continued validation of our management team and a business model that delivers actual performance. We achieved an efficiency ratio below 55% during the third quarter as our company continues to grow operating leverage. The efficiency ratio was impacted positively by couple of one-time events. Dave will get into those specifics for you. Our non-interest expense to average assets was 1.82% and we achieved an assets to employ ratio of $13 million per employ. Our teams are executing on the strategy to control hiring and focusing on key areas where we need resources to build our organization with great bankers. This allows us to continue to grow into our fixed infrastructure and allocate our resources to the highest and best return on investment. The loan portfolio remains diversified and we have seen some improvement in overall asset quality. Our credit metrics are better than the second quarter of 2019 as our non-performing assets and classified assets are trending lower. We'll try to answer all your questions regarding our previously disclosed one-off non-performing assets but may not be able to give you all the details you'd like because we're still reviewing and restructuring the credit. We are taking a measured and conservative approach in our management of this particular loan. Lastly, our capital position remains strong after our IPO and our management team is very focused on growing and leveraging our capital in an efficient manner. Our company crossed over $600 million of equity in the third quarter with leverage and risk base ratios of 12.6% and 13.9% respectively. With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Chief Financial Officer, Dave O'Toole, for a more detailed discussion of the financial results. Dave. Thank you, George, and good afternoon to everyone. For the third quarter of 2019, our financial results were positive. We reported 0.89% return on average assets and a 7.58% return on equity. Year-over-year results were also favorable. During the quarter, we increased tangible book value per share by $0.61 from earnings and increase in the unrealized gains of our bond portfolio and the tangible book value accretion from the stock sold in our initial public offering. We experienced some net interest margin compression during the quarter but our company continues to have strong growth in earning assets that helped mitigate some of the impact from the declining rate environment. Net interest income continued to grow, reaching almost $36 million, representing a 2.6% increase on a linked-quarter basis, but a 24% increase from the same quarter in 2018. During the third quarter, our tax equivalent net interest margin declined from 3.35% to 3.24%; however, our year-to-date margin of 3.35% remains within a 3.25% or 3.50% band that we have maintained over the last five years. Much of the margin compression is a result of short-term timing differences in our asset liability rate movements. Loan yields declined 13 basis points and interest-bearing deposit costs decreased just 7 basis points on a linked-quarter basis mostly due to the timing of the adjustments. Loan yields move downward from LIBOR adjusting with the market ahead of the FOMC rate cuts while our deposit adjustments were timed with the FOMC decisions. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion in loans indexed to LIBOR and $1.2 billion in loans indexed to Prime rate. We continued to shorten the duration of our deposits to take advantage of declining rates and the majority of our deposit growth came from variable rate money market accounts. Additionally, we anticipate a significant number of time deposits will reprice downward in the next two quarters creating a positive impact to margins. Average deposits for the third quarter of 2019 grew 5% from the second quarter of 2019 and 32% since the third quarter of 2018. The company also chose to not renew $67 million of brokered deposits that matured during the quarter. During the quarter, our available for sale securities portfolio increased $28 million on a linked-quarter basis. The securities purchased were $49 million at an average tax equivalent yield of 3.06% and included approximately $20 million to replace principal payments on mortgage-backed CMOs and call securities. The investment portfolio yield declines were from a combination of lower reinvestment yields and higher prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities. Non-interest income increased $2 million in the third quarter of 2019 or 171% compared to the same quarter of 2018, and $1.5 million or 92% compared to the second quarter of 2019. As we review our non-interest income, you will notice a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in swap fees. The back-to-back swap program started in 2018 and has grown to become a material piece of our non-interest income. Historically, when we recorded swap fee income, the recognized income was partially offset by a credit valuation adjustment to account for counter-party credit risk. Due to increased materiality and stronger historical information with the types of loans wanting to hedge rates, we took a closer look with our credit personnel into the credit valuation assumptions and process. We concluded that the credit exposure was partially mitigated in underwriting so the full CVA was unnecessary. This change in methodology resulted in a one-time reversal in the quarter totalling approximately $800,000 before tax. The $1.1 million of swap fees recorded in the third quarter used the new methodology. Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2019 increased $1.3 million or 7% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and decreased $800,000 or 4% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Non-interest expense for the quarter was well managed. As George indicated, our efficiency ratio was lower for the third consecutive quarter. We've continued to manage our pace of hiring and the measurement of incentive compensation relative to performance for the year. Consequently, salary and benefits expense was down slightly from the second quarter in 2019 and on a comparable year-to-date basis with 2018. We expect to continue gaining operating efficiency and harvesting the well-recognized benefits of a branch-light strategy. During the quarter, we received an approximate $650,000 regulatory assessment credit from the FDIC, lowering regulatory fees for the quarter and year. Some of our volume-based expenses will continue to rise as we grow, but we will continue to manage our costs with the objective of enhancing profitability and efficiency. I would like to turn over the call now to CEO of CrossFirst Bank, Mike Maddox for a more detailed discussion regarding our loan portfolio and asset quality. Mike? Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, our goal is to continue generating positive operating leverage, at the same time, we intend you to continue to invest in our people and grow the company in a profitable way. Talented people are how we have been successful over the years and we want to continue hiring the best people in our industry. Our management team is extremely focused on retaining the talent we have and bringing in high-caliber bankers to our organization. I'd like to move on to discuss our loan portfolio and asset quality. We believe our underwriting standards and processes remain strong. During the quarter, we increased average loans 4% versus the second quarter of 2019 and 40% compared to the same quarter and in 2018 despite having $204 million in payoffs in the third quarter. In Q3, we funded $367 million in loans to replace and grow the overall portfolio by $163 million. Many of the payoffs that occurred in the quarter were larger credits. We had a number of customers that sold their companies and completely paid down their borrowings. Our portfolios and our more developed markets typically experienced the largest amount of churn in the portfolio and our teams have done a fantastic job of finding new opportunities to mitigate the payoffs. We have continued to see customers in the real estate market look for a long-term fixed rate opportunities, which has contributed to the increase in the back-to-back swap activity that they have talked about. The largest contributors to our third-quarter growth was a balanced combination of commercial and industrial loans and real estate projects. Moving on to asset quality, as George mentioned, our classifieds and non-performing assets are trending down and we finished the quarter with a classified to capital ratio of 13%. We provision $4.9 million to support the continued loan growth and increase the specific reserve to our previously identified non-performing credit. Again, it is really an attribute to the strong team that we have built here to achieve record levels of net income this quarter and be able to increase our provisioning. Our past dues increased for the quarter mainly from administrative rollovers and the larger one-off non-performing credit that we are in the process of monitoring and working through. At the end of the quarter, the overall loan loss reserve was 1.18% of the loans compared to 1.24% in the second quarter of 2019. Lastly, we charged-off two previously identified and disclosed non-performing credits. One of the credits was a legacy energy credit, we have been working through since early 2015 and the other credit was a problem commercial and industrial credit. Thank you again for joining our call today. And as we mentioned earlier, our full results and financial metrics are included in the earnings release. This wraps up our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Hi Brady. So, maybe we could start with net interest margin. It's nice to see deposit costs come down a little bit this quarter. Loan yields came down more, so we did see some NIM compression. How do you think the net interest margin trends from here? Brady, this is Dave. We didn't get to see the full benefit of the second Fed adjustment during the quarter, kind of, occurred at the end of September. With that adjustment, we were pretty aggressive in adjusting our deposit rates actually more than the amount of the Fed adjustment. So, we think the fourth quarter, NIM will stabilize somewhat until we get to that large pool of CDs that are out there that need to roll over in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. We could see some additional compression but I don't think it'll be all that much and depending upon loan growth during the quarter. But, I'm optimistic that we will be able to hold pretty close to the band that we have continued to try to shoot for. All right. And then it was nice to see swap income be so strong at a little over $1 million. Would you consider that the new run rate, or was that just a really nice quarter in 3Q and going forward it should fall off that $1.1 million run rate? That could be a high quarter for us, but I think we will continue with a very strong run rate. We've got some transactions that are currently in the process for the fourth quarter. I haven't really determined what the swap fee will be on those. So, I would expect swap fees to run close to that number, maybe not quite at $1 million a quarter. All right. And then last for me, the assessment credit that you got from the FDIC. I think you said it was $650,000? Right. Is that all of it or will you have any of that assessment that could be realized going forward as well? Our best estimate is we should get a little over a million dollars of total credit out of that change in the assessment calculation. So, there could be as much as another $500,000 that will come going forward. Okay. But the timing of that is on – or will it be in 4Q? I don't think it will all be in fourth quarter. I believe it will be – I think it will come out over the next two quarters, Brady. All right. Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Michael. Hey, Michael. Maybe we could just go back to the margin. It looks like you guys had some accelerated premium amortization this quarter on the muni book. What was the – do you have a sense for what the impact was this quarter from the premium in basis points? Michael, I don't have an exact number but clearly we did have some accelerated premium amortization on our mortgage-backed portfolio and probably on some of the munis. The impact was probably the change in the yield of the portfolio during that period. But I don't have a dollar amount for you. Okay. ...but I'll certainly get it for you. Yeah. No problem. And then, maybe just as a follow up, LIBOR is down again this quarter, and the odds of a rate cut in October are pretty high. So in reference to Brady's question about the kind of stabilizing within the band that you referenced earlier, does that include a potential rate cut either in October or December? Yeah. We do anticipate another rate cut this year, two rate cuts is probably outside of what we're expecting at this point. We're continuing to look at our deposits in trying to determine the pools that we can bring down. Should the Fed move here in the next couple of weeks, it is our intent to move our higher yielding money market accounts down with those adjustments kind of on a one-for-one basis or possibly even greater than that. As you know, as deposits were going up, we were moving pretty quickly with in rate increases so we're trying to stay on track on the way down. Yeah. And just to be clear, the assumption for a rate cut, is that in October you're assuming, are you assuming December? In our modeling, it was in December, but just in the last quarter as circumstances have changed obviously, it looks like there is a high likelihood, it could occur this month. So there could be some difference in our numbers based on that 60-day difference in timeframe. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the loan growth this quarter, it looks like the originations were pretty strong, but you had obviously pretty high level of paydowns. As we move forward, I mean, would you expect paydowns to be at elevated levels just because rates are coming down, I would assume so, but would love any color and commentary on kind of the outlook for loan growth in the next couple quarters? Thanks. Yeah, Michael, we had an unusual situation in the third quarter. We actually had five customers that sold companies that contributed over $90 million worth of paydowns of credit. We don't anticipate that that will continue to happen. So if you also, if you take away the credit that we sold to participants, we grew the portfolio from a production standpoint about 5.5%. We believe, we'll continue on a pace in that range. Michael, this is... Okay. Michael, this is George, on – more on your question, we see both in Kansas City and in Dallas, significant fundings between now and the end of the year accelerated to a certain extent. So I think Q4 is going to be pretty strong for loan growth. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one more for me, just a housekeeping question. So the other non-interest income line, I know that bounces around from quarter to quarter, but any anything that's kind of one-time mission there or is just a myriad of things? The change in methodology on the swap fees is obviously, there's some one-time activity there that occurred where we've reversed about $800,000 worth of credit valuation adjustment that had been recorded earlier in the year, but other than that in non-interest income, Matt? You know we've got pretty steady increase in our credit card processing fees and ATM fees. So I don't think there is anything beyond the CVA adjustment that's kind of one-time. Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Thank you, Michael. Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks guys. How are you? Good. Good. Fine, Matt. I want to go back to deposit pricing and I think you referenced the pool of CDs that will mature in 4Q and 1Q. Can you just remind us the size of the pool of these CDs and the average cost of the CDs and what you're replacing similar duration CDs at currently? That pool of CDs were two different CDs specials that we did last year and they are 13 months CDs and there's a few of them that are in there at 2.75% and there's a big group of matter in there at 3%. About $90 million mature in the fourth quarter and the balance re-mature in the first quarter of 2020. We kind of expected that we can retain a big portion of those CDs and probably roll them into our higher yielding money market accounts as opposed to another fixed liability instrument. We're trying not to promote too much fixed deposit stuff. So we'll move them into an appropriate money market account probably and depending on whether there's another rate adjustment or two but if they were moved today they'd move into something in the 1.75% range. Okay. Down a 1% to 1.25% on that group of deposits. Yeah. That's a pretty good chunk there, so that would be helpful. There's There is some of those the deposits will have difficulty holding on to, but we think we can keep a majority of them. There is a large part of that belong to existing customers. And then switching gears over to credit quality, it looks like there was a notable uptick in loans past due  sort of 89 days (00:27:52) about $40 million. Anything to call out there in terms of just one loan or few loans or any industry or any color you can give us on that? It was primarily a result of the one credit we've discussed in the past. We did have a couple of administrative rollovers, but nothing we're concerned about from a credit quality standpoint. It was primarily related to one credit. Okay. And just to clarify that's different than the non-accrual loan we've discussed in the past, this is a new credit I assume that the... The same credit. No, it's the same one. Okay. Matt, true – it truly – if you look at the rest of the credit metrics, it truly is a one-off. I know you guys have heard that from every other management team that you talk to, but it truly is a one-off credit relating to the credit quality of this company. Okay. I guess just to clarify to that credit wasn't past due until this past quarter. That's correct. Okay, understood. Okay, I guess, just lastly for me, you guys have a pretty good concentration of energy lending. Any general commentary, you can give us on the energy book at this point and are you guys expecting to grow that book or just maintain at current levels? Overall, I think we're really pleased with the performance of our energy portfolio. The mix continues to stay consistent with where it's been about 70% oil, 30% gas. As we've talked in the past, we only loan on proof-producing assets and we're very, very comfortable with our underwriting policy. From a growth standpoint, the goal really is to maintain that portfolio in a range between that 8% and 11%. Today, we're at about 10.9%. We want to continue to be able to take advantage of good opportunities in the market, but we're very mindful of keeping that concentration in that range. Okay. And then, my last question I know you've been targeting a 1% ROA and it seems to be within sight as you had more scale, but on the other hand, the rate environment somewhat moving against you. Any commentary you can give us on that 1% ROA and how close that is to achieving that? We're obviously in the reforecasting process right now for next year. We're hopeful that we can exceed the 1% ROA in 2020. We're not at that run rate quite yet, but if our balance sheet continues the way it has been and this rate environment stabilizes just a little bit which is what it looks like the forecast is for next year, we should be able to exceed 1% ROA in 2020. Okay. Great. Thank you guys. Thank you, Matt. Thank you and I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back to Matt Needham for any closing remarks. Thank you all again for joining us today. This call can be accessed via replay at our website and as always, you can contact me with any questions you might have and following up. Again, we appreciate your interest in our company and for those of you, investors, thank you for your time and have a great evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Gentlemen, you may begin. Thank you. Thank you, Angel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining our third quarter call this morning. We had a busy and very productive quarter with strong earnings, solid organic growth, the closing of the Kinderhook transaction in July, and the announcement this morning of our acquisition of Steuben Trust Corporation. Operating earnings were up 4% over last year's quarter and 5% over the second quarter. Organic loan growth was strong for both the commercial and mortgage businesses, and organic deposit growth in non-public funds was also very good. We closed the Kinderhook transaction in July, as I commented on last quarter's call, and that integration and subsequent operational performance could not be going better. We have a strong leadership team there on both the commercial and retail side and like the opportunities we see in the Albany market going forward. As we announced this morning, we're thrilled to be partnering with Steuben Trust Corporation, a $570-million-asset bank in Western New York. This is a high-value, lower-risk transaction of a solid-performing, in-market institution. We have considerable close proximity branch overlap and so also have consolidation opportunities that we have not incorporated into our model. We expect to close in the second quarter of 2020 and expect full-year accretion, excluding cost saves, to approximate $0.08 to $0.09 per share. Overall, it was a solid quarter and we're having a strong year, particularly in light of the fact that the full-year 2019 Durbin hit was a $7 million headwind compared to 2018. Our performance momentum is very good heading into Q4 and looking forward both the Kinderhook and Steuben transactions should be nicely additive to 2020. Joe? Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark noted, the third quarter was a very active and productive quarter for the company. We closed on the Kinderhook transaction early in the quarter, increased our dividend $0.03 per share, redeemed $22.7 million of trust preferred securities, navigated two interest rate cuts by the Fed, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Steuben Trust Corporation, and produced a year-over-year improvement in quarterly operating earnings of $0.03 per share. Before I review the third quarter earnings results in more detail, I'd like to touch on the other activities. At July 12th, we closed our acquisition of Kinderhook Bank Corp. As a reminder, we acquired Kinderhook in an all-cash transaction for $93.4 million. In connection with the transaction, we acquired $479.9 million in loans and $560.1 million in total deposits. These amounts were in line with our expectations when we announced the transaction in the first quarter. We are confident that we will meet or modestly exceed our 30% cost savings targets and expect the Kinderhook transaction will reduce GAAP earnings per share of $0.08 on full-year basis. We remain excited about opportunities in the Kinderhook markets and the capital region generally. During the third quarter, the company raised its quarterly dividend from $0.38 per share to $0.41 per share. The $0.03 increase represents approximately 8% increase in the quarterly dividend rate and increased the company's streak of raising its dividend to 27 consecutive years. We are proud of this achievement and believe the company's business model, earnings results and strong capital resources do not only support this increase but also allow us to maintain significant flexibility for future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we redeemed $22.7 million of trust preferred securities with a weighted average rate of 4.343%, $20.6 million of these TruPs were acquired in connection with the company's 2017 acquisition and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. and $2.1 million were acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. Now I'd like to briefly comment on the operating and deal metrics regarding Steuben. As noted in this morning's press release, Steuben Trust is a 15-branch franchise operating in a six-county region in Western New York. Community Bank currently serves four of these counties within Steuben's current footprint, and the other two are contiguous to our markets. The demographics are consistent with much of our current New York State footprint, but also increase our presence in the Greater Buffalo and Rochester, New York markets. At the end of the second quarter, Steuben had total assets of $577 million, including total loans of $347 million and $484 million in total deposits. Steuben's loan portfolio was largely a commercial book with $166 million or 48% of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate and $62 million or 18% in commercial and industrial, agricultural and farm loans. Steuben also has approximately $98 million or 28% of its total loan portfolio in one to four family residential real estate loans, including approximately $60 million in home equity loans. Consumer and other loans make up the balance of the loan portfolio of approximately $20 million or 6% of the total loan portfolio. Steuben's trailing 12-month return on average assets was 1.25%. Net interest margin over the same period was 3.68%. As noted in our press release, shareholders of Steuben Trust Corporation will receive, for each share of common stock they own, a combination of $12.60 in cash and 0.8054 shares of Community Bank System, Inc. for total consideration valued at approximately $63 per share. The purchase multiples for the pending merger are 15.2 times the last 12 months earnings at 1.67 times stated tangible book value. The operating expense cost savings are estimated at 30%. The transaction is expected to be $0.08 to $0.09 GAAP accretive on the first full year basis and $0.09 to $0.10 on a cash EPS basis. The transaction is also expected to be tangible book value accretive. The pro forma consolidated balance sheet is estimated to increase Community Bank's total assets to over $12 billion. Before I provide additional color on the quarterly earnings, I will provide some commentary on the balance sheet. We closed the third quarter of 2019 with total assets of $11.6 billion. This is up $851.9 million or 7.9% from the end of the second quarter of 2019 due to both the Kinderhook transaction and organic balance sheet growth. Total assets were up $990 million or 9.3% from the end of 2018 and $937.7 million or 7.9% from one year earlier. Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2019 of $9.81 billion were up $379.1 million or 4% when compared to the linked second quarter and up $473.5 million or 5.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2018. Average loan balances in the third quarter of 2019 were up $441 million or 7% when compared to the linked second quarter of 2019 and up $445.9 million or 7.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2018. Ending loan balances were also up on a linked quarter comparative basis, $569.1 million or 9.1%, $471.7 million attributable to loans acquired in the Kinderhook transaction, and an additional $97.4 million attributable to organic growth in the company's loan portfolios. Exclusive of the loans acquired in the Kinderhook transaction, outstanding balances in all the company's loan portfolio segments increased during the quarter. More specifically, the business lending portfolio increased $56.4 million or 2.4% during the quarter, while consumer mortgage balances were up $29.4 million or 1.3%, and the consumer indirect and direct portfolios were up $10.8 million or 0.9%. Loan balances outstanding in the home equity portfolio also increased slightly in the quarter. Average total deposits were up $506.6 million or 6% from the same quarter last year, and up $423.5 million or 5% on a linked quarter basis. Total deposits at the end of the third quarter were $9.17 billion, up $704.5 million or 8.3% from the year prior and up $680.1 million or 8% on a linked quarter basis. Although $571.9 million of growth in the linked quarter is attributable to the Kinderhook transaction, the remaining increase of $108.2 million is attributable to organic growth and deposit balances. 68% of the company's total deposit balances at the end of the quarter were comprised of checking and savings accounts. At September 30, the company's investment portfolio stood at $2.48 billion. This is up $79.5 million or 3.3% from the end of the linked second quarter. During the third quarter, the company increased its holdings of municipal securities, agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and other investments. At the end of the third quarter, the company's cash equivalents stood at $781.7 million. The tax-equivalent net yield on investment securities and cash equivalents during the third quarter was 2.52%. This compares with 2.54% one year prior and 2.58% in the linked second quarter exclusive of the Federal Reserve Bank dividend. The effective duration of the investment securities portfolio was 2.5 years at September 30, 2019. Shareholders' equity was up $172.1 million or 10.3% from one year prior due primarily to an $86.9 million increase in retained earnings and a $64.6 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which included a $74.2 million increase in after-tax market value adjustment on the company's available-for-sale investment portfolio. The company's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.76% at the end of the third quarter, over 2 times the well-capitalized regulatory standard. Tangible equity to net tangible assets ended the quarter at a solid 9.68%. This is down from 10.56% at the end of the second quarter due largely to the impact of the Kinderhook transaction, but up 55 basis points from 9.13% one year prior. The company recorded GAAP net income of $39.2 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.75 during the third quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $43.1 million and $0.83 in GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, the company incurred $0.09 of acquisition-related expenses net of tax effect due to the Kinderhook transaction. By comparison, during the third quarter of 2018, the company recorded $0.02 of incremental earnings per share associated with the acquisition-related recovery. Operating diluted earnings per share, which exclude acquisition expenses, realized gains on the sale of investment securities, unrealized losses on equity securities, and loss on debt extinguishment, were $0.84 in the third quarter of 2019. This compares to operating diluted earnings per share of $0.81 in the third quarter of 2018. The $0.03 or 3,7% increase in the operating diluted earnings per share between comparable periods was driven by an increase in net interest income and increase in noninterest revenues and a decrease in the provision for loan losses but was offset in part by a higher operating expenses and an increase in fully diluted shares outstanding. Total revenues for the third quarter of $148.4 million were up $6.4 million or 4.5% over the third quarter of 2018. This included a $5.1 million or a 5.9% increase in net interest income and a $1.3 million or 2.3% increase in noninterest revenues. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in earning assets largely due to Kinderhook acquisition and a 2 basis point increase in the net interest margin from 3.71% in the third quarter of 2018 to 3.73% in the third quarter of 2019. The increase in noninterest revenues was driven by an increase in all three of the company's nonbanking fee businesses; employee benefit services, wealth management and insurance. Exclusive of $4.9 million of realized gains on the sale of securities recorded during the second quarter, total revenues increased $4.2 million or 2.9% on a linked quarter basis, $3 million attributable to an increase in net interest income and $1.2 million attributable to an increase in noninterest revenues. The company's net interest margin was down 7 basis points as compared to the linked second quarter which included a $0.9 million Federal Reserve semiannual dividend payment or the equivalent of 4 basis points of net interest margin. All other factors, including the addition of the Kinderhook earning assets and liabilities, organic loan growth during the quarter, changes in the company's funding mix, and the two 25 basis point decreases in the prime lending rate between the periods resulted in a 3 basis point decrease in net interest margin on a linked quarter basis. The company's total cost of deposits remain well below peer and industry averages for the third quarter at 26 basis points, reflective of the company's very solid base of core deposits. Noninterest revenues in our financial services businesses, including employee benefit services, insurance services and wealth management services, were up $1.5 million or 4% between comparable annual quarters. Banking noninterest revenues were up $0.2 million or 1.1% over the prior year and $0.7 million or 4.2% on a linked quarter basis. Noninterest revenues contributed 38.6% of the company's total operating revenues during the third quarter similar to the first two quarters of 2019 and full-year 2018 results. Total operating expenses, excluding $6.1 million of acquisition-related expenses, were up $4.8 million or 5.6% on an annual quarter comparative basis. This increase included a $5 million or 9.8% increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $0.3 million or less than 1% increase, net increase in all other expenses, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets. On a linked quarter basis, total operating expenses, excluding acquisition-related expenses, were up $0.9 million or 1%. During the third quarter, the FDIC awarded the company a $0.7 million assessment credit for its proportional share of excess deposit insurance fund reserves. In addition, the company's marketing and business development expenses decreased $0.5 million on a linked quarter basis. We recorded $1.8 million in the provision for loan losses during the third quarter of 2019. This compares to $2.2 million recorded as provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.4 million decrease between comparable periods. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 21.1%, up from 21% in the third quarter of 2018. The company recorded greater amounts of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation activity in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2019. Exclusive of stock-based compensation and tax benefits, the company's effective tax rate was 21.5% in the third quarter of 2019. Our asset quality remains strong at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Nonperforming loans comprised of both legacy and acquired loans totaled $28.7 million or 0.42% of total loans. We recorded net charge-offs of $1.6 million or 10 basis points annualized on the loan portfolio during the third quarter of 2019. This compares to net charge-offs of $1.7 million or 11 basis points during the third quarter of 2018. At the end of the quarter, the company's total OREO properties were less than $2 million and the internal loan risk grades portends stable asset quality. In summary, we believe the company remains very well positioned for the future. The company's strong asset quality, capital reserves, liquidity, core funding base and strong nonbanking business revenues provide a solid foundation for continued growth and dividend capacity. The company's current market valuation also provides an excellent currency for potential future mergers and acquisitions. We look forward to moving forward with the Steuben team on integration efforts over the coming months, as well as increasing our service capacity in our Western New York markets. Thank you. I will now turn it back to Angel to open the line for questions. And our first question will come from the line of Alex Twerdahl of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Alex. Good morning, Alex. Just first off congrats on landing another acquisition. Just curious how long does it take you guys to do the due diligence process on a bank the size of Steuben kind of from start to deal announcement? I would say, Alex, it depends on the institution and how readily they can gather materials up. In this case they were very efficient and so the due diligence period was fairly nominal. But they can certainly extend for greater periods of time depending on the capacity of the counterparty to provide information. Okay. Just trying to figure out the cadence of these deals is going to be in the future years. Talking about sort of specific organic trends, had some loan growth for the first time, or better loan growth I should say, the best in a number of quarters this quarter. I know it's helped a little bit by seasonality in the municipal business. But was growth more a function of the lack of payoff that you've been seeing in past quarters? And I think the pipeline kind of translated into some better growth this quarter than what we've been seeing. Or is it the contribution of Kinderhook or is there something else that we should be thinking about up there? Yeah. I think, Alex, in the third quarter, we had a pretty good performance from Vermont. We had good performance in the Capital District, Albany, and also the southern region of New York was very good, so Syracuse, Rochester, Western New York, Finger Lakes was also – was very good. If you look at it year-over-year, PA has been very good and likewise kind of the southern and western parts of New York and the Capital District, again, has been very good year-over-year. So, it really depends, and it can kind of change quarter-to-quarter. With respect to early payoff, I think we did get fewer this quarter which was good. I think just the number and the size was a little bit less this quarter which was good. So, I think we – if you look over the last several years, we have substantially improved our organic generation capabilities. Some of that is a function of, as we've gotten a little bit larger, we've gotten greater expertise in certain elements of credit. We have the capacity, by virtue, of our credit discipline and our ability to kind of understand larger credits to do slightly larger credits and manage effectively larger relationships and syndication kind of  plum deals (00:21:39) with others. So, I think all those things have played into that, but we clearly have improved our organic loan generation ability over the last couple of years. Okay. And the pipeline going into the fourth quarter and early 2020 is still healthy? It's still really good, yeah. So, we would expect to see continued decent performance going into the fourth quarter. And then just switching gears, just to touch on the margin here even with the acquisitions and the Fed dividend, et cetera. It bounced around a little bit but over the last couple of years your margin was in a pretty steady kind of 3.65% to 3.80%. And with the face of now two Fed cuts, another one potentially next week and maybe even another one this year is – I mean, do you have enough tools because on the way up, obviously, deposit is where you'd benefit, on the way down they're not going to be as much of a benefit. Are there enough tools with the short-term nature of your securities portfolio and kind of as stuff comes due in the reinvestment rates, et cetera, and keep the margin within that range over the foreseeable future? Yeah. So, Alex, I think we've kind of given general expectations around 3.70%. Last quarter we came in a little higher. This quarter loan yields held up fairly well in the quarter. I think we're down on a net basis 1 – down 1 basis points net quarter-over-quarter. And that was against the headwinds of the decreases that the FOMC put through. Just to kind of give you some color, we have about $1 billion in loans that are subject to repricing either linked to prime or, to a lesser extent, LIBOR. So, when we get a decrease from the FOMC in prime rate, that's the impact. The other side of that equation is we have $9 billion in deposits, and so we have the ability in some instances to contain those costs and potentially reduce some of the higher cost deposits in that mix. If you recall prior to the cycle that started in late-2015 and, for that matter, a good portion of that cycle our cost of funds was 10 basis points. We're sitting at 26 basis points today. So, I think there's still some opportunity to decrease some of our costs. We also paid off the TruPs this quarter so that's going to help a little bit. So, I think there's a couple of tools left. The other thing I would note is that we do have a substantial residential mortgage portfolio. And even though we do have some borrowers \"in the money\" relative to secondary market rates, the non-conforming nature of our portfolio tends to slow prepayment activity relative to the rest of the market. So, that portfolio holds up pretty well even when market rates come down. And we did book this quarter, as we booked new loans, we booked those at about kind of par with our existing book yields. So, as the new loans went on, they went on pretty much close to our – very close to our book yields this quarter. If you recall, on prior quarters it was a little bit higher. But all in, we've kind of maintained new loan yields at levels very similar to our book yields. Okay. That's very helpful. And just to kind of hone in on the deposit piece of it, the 26 basis points, obviously not a ton of room to go down. Following up on your thoughts, and maybe they will go down, I mean, do you think they'd go down in the fourth quarter after two, potentially three cuts this year or is there still going to be a little bit of a lag and maybe some costs actually moving higher into the end of the year. Good question, Alex. My expectation is that they'd be similar in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. But if rates stayed down on the short end, and for that matter kind of in the mid part of the range, I would expect that over time they will start to drift down in 2020. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you, Alex. Thanks, Alex. And we'll take our next question from Russell Gunther of Davidson. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Russell. Good morning, Russell. I wanted to follow up on the expense outlook here which I believe you said that you'd expect the cost base from Kinderhook to meet, potentially exceed. Just curious if you could give us a sense for what sort of in the run rate already from those related cost saves and how that should trend going forward? Yes. Russell, we realized the majority, I'll say of the run rate cost saves in the third quarter. They're generally baked in at this point. We potentially have some other modest cost savings in the fourth quarter, but it's a little too early to kind of call it on a full year basis, so we're kind of holding our general guidance at around 30% and $0.08 a share in earnings per share accretion, but in effect we've realized our operating expense savings on Kinderhook. And on an all-in basis, we actually came in this quarter, I think, even slightly above or better than our expectations around all-in operating expenses. Obviously, the FDIC insurance premium refund or credit actually helped us a little bit. We also consciously drove down some other operating expenses. We also had a little lesser net results in some of our property related write-downs and those types of expenses during the quarter. So, our less than $90 million, about $91.5 million including the FDIC expenses, is sort of ahead of our expectations. I think $93 million is a more general sense of the fourth quarter and beyond that we start to, I guess, get back to inflationary trends. Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And then on the revenue side of things, just an update, if you could, in terms of the outlook within your employee benefit services. Well, I would say we expect it to continue to grow as it has for 15 years. I think one of the challenges just as that business gets bigger, growing at the same rate gets more difficult. But we've got pretty solid and steady growth in that business now that the run rate on revenue is almost $100 million. And so, I think that business will continue to grow. It might grow at a slightly smaller percentage basis. I'm not sure it's going to grow at a smaller dollar volume basis which is helpful because there's a certain amount of fixed cost there that's not inconsiderable, so you can expand the margin and the margin on that business is actually much higher than it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago was pretty good. So, I think also we have some other new revenue line opportunities in that business that we will continue to explore and some of them have reasonably significant potential growth. So, there's certain capabilities we have in that business that we think we can continue to evolve and develop and put into the market that will be helpful. So, I think those businesses will continue to grow, Russell, I think probably at a smaller percentage pace, but I would expect  now necessarily (00:30:17) at a smaller dollar base. Got it. I appreciate that, Mark, very helpful. I guess just as a follow-up, the potential new revenue lines within that vertical, is that something that would necessitate related acquisitions or can be done kind of organically? I think it could. I think we would probably not look at paying a lot for something. That space right now, the private equity firms are playing in that space in a very meaningful way and have essentially bid up prices in that space to a point where it makes a lot less sense for a strategic buyer than it does a financial buyer. But we have tremendous operational capacity in that business, and we have the ability to develop solutions based on our existing platforms to leverage additional service capacity into the market. So, it could be. I mean, we've looked at, I'll call them, smaller acquisitions that already kind of have a developed platform that we could leverage better. We've also had conversations about existing opportunities that we can build out our current platform to serve. Some of these opportunities are fairly significant, I would say. So, I think we have some pretty good runway still left in that business going forward. I appreciate your thoughts there, Mark. Thank you for that. Last one from me, guys. You had disclosed the impact of CECL as it relates to the mark in this deal. Just curious, any preliminary thoughts you could share or just an update on timing for when we might get a look at the full disclosure as impact for the pro forma balance sheet. Russell, good question. We are working on additional disclosures for this quarter's Q. So, we're going to expand our disclosure. Our model is built. We've kind of run it through on a parallel basis for a couple of quarters now. We had our validation completed, and we'll be making some additional disclosures in the Q as I said. Very good. Thank you, guys, for taking my questions. Thanks, Russell. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Collyn. Good morning, Collyn. Just a few housekeeping questions, I'm sorry I missed it. What did you say, Joe, the impact was of the FDIC savings this quarter? About $700,000 to the good. Okay. And will that – would you start – have you absorbed all your credit as it relates to that, so that then costs will be – start to be incurred in the fourth quarter again, or how will that play through? Yeah. There's additional credits potentially available depending on how the fund performs. So, if the fund performs above its target benchmark for reserves, we would expect that sort of impact to occur for another two quarters, and we would likely exhaust the credit after a couple more quarters. Okay. Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then just on the deposit growth side, I know you'd indicated overall what the impact was from Kinderhook, but you guys saw some really good noninterest-bearing deposit growth this quarter. So, just trying to understand the movement within some of those segments. Yeah. I think it was small. You typically get variations in the public funding, and we have, give or take, $1 billion or so in public funds and that can change quarter-to-quarter by the couple hundred million dollars or so. So, we like to look at kind of public funding separately from the nonpublic. We continue over the course of the past year to have very good growth in kind of the core checking, savings, money market, nonpublic funds. It never moves dramatically, but it's kind of a slow and continual cadence of low-single digit growth in that core deposit base. As Joe said, about 68% of our deposits right now are in checking and savings accounts that have actually very long lives in our markets. So, nothing tremendous, Collyn. I don't think our shareholders want us growing our deposits 10% because we're not in those markets and that means we've paid up to acquire them. So, we tried to do it the old-fashioned way in our markets, but we just have a continued cadence of growth in the core deposit part of the deposit base, which obviously is very good. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just another housekeeping item. It looks like you guys have folded in the mortgage banking line into deposit services – on just deposit services – deposit service charges. Just curious of the breakout there and why that is. Is it just because you're going to deemphasize that line going forward? Good question. I think just in totality, we thought it was just easy to put those two line items together because we don't have a substantial mortgage banking business in the sense that we don't sell a significant part of our portfolio to the secondary market. It's just not a line of business that we actively have been in and originating in selling mortgages. We portfolio-ed the lion's share of our mortgages over the years. Okay. So, not a big variance we should assume in this quarter's line versus what you've done historically. It's just you folded it in. Yeah. It's down a little bit on the mortgage banking side, but not all that significant to the total revenues of the company, for sure. Okay. Okay. And then just two sort of a little bit more big picture questions, just as it relates to the margin, as we look out into 2020 and assume we sort of stay in this low rate environment, what – is there a point where you feel like the margin can kind of bottom or how do you sort of see it broadly playing out as we look into 2020 with assuming that the last Fed cut comes in the first quarter of 2020? Sorry. Yeah. I mean if we have two more Fed cuts, it will likely negatively impact the margin in 2020. As I think it was pointed out earlier in the call, even in the post-crisis era, we tended to keep our margin kind of in that 3.60% range, low-3.60s to mid-3.60s. Expectations would be that we would probably maintain it in the 3.60s level at least through most of 2020. Obviously, if the yield curve stays flat to inverted and low for a very long period of time, that'll become more difficult to sustain in years beyond 2020. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the M&A front with Steuben and further opportunities, do you see more deals or the supply of potential deals increasing similar to a profile that Steuben has? Or how do you sort of see M&A playing out for you guys? Yeah. I think we will have – I think there's a pretty long runway of opportunities for us in the future and we try to be very disciplined about the partners that we participate with. Steuben is a good example. It might not be as big as other things we could do, but if you look at – I mean it's a very high performing institution for its size. I mean the ROA is over 1.20%. The efficiency ratio is 60%. The asset quality is clean. They have a nice trust department. So, it's in our footprint. We have branch overlap. It's a very good profile of the kind of partner that we're interested in. So, I think there's a number of those across our footprint. I would just kind of repeat, historically our acquisition strategy has been to be disciplined, do high value, lower risk kind of things where the risk return profile is asymmetric. And Steuben, as do Kinderhook, clearly fit that profile. If you look at, we are now in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, and that's a fairly big geographic footprint for us to continue to identify and work with others on opportunities. And also we would look to kind of contiguous markets as well. So, you can't go very far north and east of where we are, we can move a little bit south and west. And so we've had conversations with institutions in adjacent markets that are south and west of us as well and I suspect that will continue. It's important for us – the organic execution is important for us. I think, historically, we rely too much on M&A for the earnings growth that we were getting. We needed to improve on that. I think we have improved on that and we'll continue to see the benefits of that greater capacity around organic execution going forward. But I also think that M&A opportunities, this kind of high-value, lower-risk opportunities, if you look at our history over the last 10 or 15 years, a lot of the balance sheet growth has come from M&A. And I think we've been able to be disciplined about it and extract the value for shareholders out of the execution on those – out of those transactions. So, as I've always said, it's not about being big. I mean, this has got nothing to do with scale. I'd rather be smaller than bigger. But in an industry with regulated capital, if you want to get operating performance improvement, you have to get a little bit bigger over time. But if you look at our return metrics have also improved over time. So, I think that's – I mean that will be the strategy going forward. I think we continue to have lots of opportunities. It doesn't matter whether it's a somewhat larger institution or a smaller institution. It has to be something that kind of fits our profile or we won't do it. So, we don't need to take those risks. I think we trade at a above-average multiple in the market for a reason, and I don't think we're going to do something that's undisciplined or chase growth for the sake of growth to put our shareholders at risk in any way. So, we'll continue to be disciplined and we'll continue, I suspect, to find high-value acquisition opportunities going forward. Okay. That's great. That was all I had. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Collyn. Thanks, Collyn. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Zwick of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Erik. Good morning, Erik. A couple questions on the Steuben transaction. First, was this a competitive bid situation or a negotiated transaction? I'm not going to comment at this juncture, Erik. We just announced, so I will – I guess there're probably more to be disclosed going forward. Understood. That's fine. And then, just want to make sure I heard the comments clear. With the 30% targeted cost savings, that does not currently incorporate any targeted branch closures that you may revisit that at a later time. Did I hear that correctly? That's right. Okay. And then, just looking at their net interest margin, looks like it's been pretty stable over the past year or so. Given the outlook for potentially a couple more Fed cuts and for the yield curve to stay flat, would you expect any major changes to their margin between now and the targeted deal closing? And I guess the heart of my question just to kind of zero in on the pro forma impact to the pro forma margin of the company. Yeah. Erik, I think it would be – it's going to be similar to the same headwinds that we're facing and the industry's facing. In other words, my expectation is it would not be that the margin will hit north and go up, but it potentially would drift down a little bit with the FOMC cuts, but nothing really out of alignment with the industry, in general. Okay. And then, maybe just kind of one detailed follow-up on that. It looks like they've got about 20% of their deposits in jumbo time and just given your strong loan-to-deposit ratio, is there an opportunity to let some of those run off and help you withstand the headwinds that we've just discussed? Yeah. I mean there are some jumbo CDs that are priced at market, and I think as those come up for renewal, we'll have to evaluate the overall relationship and profitability with each of those situations. But historically, we have not paid through the market for deposit funding. I would expect that we're going to maintain our discipline around that going forward. So, expectations are that that jumbo book is probably not going to grow and  major us (00:45:37) down a little bit over future quarters. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks, Erik. Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand it back over to you for closing, please. Very good. Thank you all again for joining our call, and we will talk to you again in January. Thank you. And this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day everyone. Take care."

         "Welcome to the Old National Bancorp Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and has been made accessible to the public in accordance with the SEC's Regulation FD. Corresponding presentation slides can be found on the Investor Relations page at oldnational.com and will be archived there for 12 months. Before turning the call over, management would like to remind everyone that as noted on slide 2, certain statements on today's call may be forward-looking in nature and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed. The company's risk factors are fully disclosed and discussed within its SEC filings. In addition, certain slides contain non-GAAP measures which management believes provides more appropriate comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are intended to assist investors understanding of performance trends. Reconciliation for these numbers are contained within the appendix of the presentation. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Ryan for opening remarks. Mr. Ryan? Good morning. I would characterize our third quarter results as consistent with our stated strategy and slightly better than our own expectations. Net income was $69.8 million and earnings per share were $0.41. When adjusted for merger charges and debt securities gain, net income was slightly higher at $70.5 million. We were pleased that adjusted earnings per share is up more than 10% from a year ago. As you view our results, you'll see that our core margin change was in line with our previous guidance. We also had a strong quarter in our fee income businesses but do expect them to return to their normal seasonal patterns. And lastly, we demonstrated good expense control. As you can see on slide 3, our adjusted return on average assets was 1.4% and our adjusted return on average tangible common equity was a strong 17.2%. During the quarter, we did see record new commercial loan production. Commercial real estate loans grew nicely but were offset by continued elevated levels of commercial and industrial clients selling their businesses and lower line usage. As a result, total loans were essentially flat for the second quarter. I remain confident that we aren't losing clients or opportunities because we aren't competitive. In fact, our markets remain strong and our clients continue to be optimistic as evidenced by our record commercial production. Today, our commercial pipeline remains a strong $2 billion. As you've come to expect from us and given the global backdrop and the inconsistent economic data, we are also staying disciplined and continue to focus on lending in our footprint. Total deposits increased 2.4% annualized and total cost of deposits in September were 49 basis points versus 52 basis points for the full third quarter. We've deliberately started to reprice our core deposits in reaction to recent Fed moves and the inverted yield curve. Loans and deposits are also a strong 84% and we remain a low-cost core deposit funded bank. Regardless of the interest rate environment today, we believe the key to long-term success is a low-cost core deposit base. We remain focused on improving our operating leverage despite the challenging revenue environment. Operating leverage improved 624 basis points year-over-year and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 55.6% which improved 341 basis points year-over-year. Exceptional credit quality remains a hallmark of our company with our lower in-house lending limits, a diversified mix and a granular loan portfolio. Our average new commercial credit remains well under $1 million despite the record production. We've recorded $1.4 million in provision, a net charge-offs of only $800,000. And those that have followed us for a while can appreciate we are very quick to identify weakness in credits, we are hard graders, and we work through issues in a very timely fashion. Our NPAs did fall slightly to 1.31%. On the capital front, we did repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $16.80 this quarter. Despite these repurchases, tangible book value per share grew by 3.2% and tangible common equity to asset stood at a strong 8.95%. We expect to be opportunistic with the remaining authorization as we have been year-to-date. Brendon is going to provide more details on our anticipated day one increase to the allowance for loan losses related to the adoption of CECL. Under current economic conditions, we don't see a material change in our total reserve for our legacy portfolios as a result of our conservative lending standards and mix. However, we do need to establish a reserve for the acquired loans accounted for under our purchase accounting. As I've mentioned in prior calls, we spent the year internally focused and I've challenged our executive team to think about ways we can get better. We've generated some terrific ideas. We've also partnered with our leading consulting firm to help us think through some of this work. I wanted to provide you with a quick update. Today, we are moving towards redefining and restructuring the way we do business. This includes examining everything from how we deliver our products and services, move paper across the company, to how we allocate capital, and much more. The goal of the program is to improve the overall efficiency of the organization while improving our client experiences. We are just completing this comprehensive analysis of every business, every department, every function within the company. From this analysis, we are developing initiatives that we plan to execute over the next year. As we complete our review and finalize initiatives, what I can share with you now is it appears we have meaningful opportunities to leverage our infrastructure, improve our operating efficiency, and drive more revenue. Given the extensive nature of this review, we plan to provide more detailed information around the opportunities identified in our next quarterly earnings call. At that time, we should be able to provide details regarding the benefits we anticipate, the related costs of implementation, and a timeline for achieving the results. A quick update on M&A. Our strategy hasn't changed. We remain an active looker and a selective buyer. We are patient and continue to wait for the perfect pitch while we remain focused on execution. We have fully integrated our client partnership and have realized all of the cost savings now. Our Minnesota operations continue to perform in line with expectations and remain enthusiastic around the opportunities in that key market. Next, Brendon's going to walk us through this quarter's details. Thank you, Jim. Turning to the quarter on slide 4, both our GAAP earnings per share and our adjusted earnings per share were $0.41. Adjusted earnings per share excludes $1.3 million in merger-related charges as well as $400,000 in debt securities gains. Moving to slide 5. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue was 27% higher year-over-year. This result was driven by increased scale from our most recent Minnesota partnership, low credit cost, strong low-cost deposit base, and a continued focus on expense management. We also improved operating leverage by 624 basis points year-over-year. Slide 6 shows the trend in outstanding loans. As Jim referenced, our commercial loan production of $680 million was the largest in our company's history and represents a $52 million increase over prior quarter. We ended the quarter with a record $2 billion pipeline and commercial loan activity remained strong. Despite a record commercial loan production and solid CRE growth, total loans fell slightly in the quarter. Elevated levels of payoffs along with lower line utilization this quarter contributed to the slight decline. Loan portfolio yields, excluding accretion and interest collected on nonaccrual, declined 7 basis points and new production yields were down 24 basis points to 4.15%. Moving to slide 7, period end deposits increased during the quarter but declined slightly on an average basis. Our total cost of deposits is unchanged quarter-over-quarter at a very low 52 basis points. We continue to actively manage deposit costs in this down rate cycle and are pleased that our September total cost of deposits was 49 basis points, 3 basis points below our third quarter average. With nearly $1 billion in deposits indexed to Fed funds and proactive management of our exception price book, we are confident in our ability to thoughtfully manage deposit costs lower in response to future Fed actions. Slide 8 shows our year-over-year change in loan mix, as well as our earning asset mix for the third quarter. We have continued to remix the loan portfolio toward more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans and out of indirect and other loans. The investment portfolio yield was down 16 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but 13 basis points of the decline due to higher premium amortization, resulting from the sharp decline in long-term rates in August. Next, on slide 9, you'll see the detailed changes in our third quarter net interest income and corresponding margin. We are pleased with the performance of the margin given the challenges presented by the interest rate environment. Net interest margin, excluding accretion, was in line with our expectations at 3.26% compared to 3.39% last quarter. If you recall, second quarter core margin included 13 basis points of interest collected on nonaccrual loans, which was significantly higher than normal. Normalizing for the higher than expected accretion and lower interest collected on nonaccruals, the margin shows 5 basis points of compression. 4 basis points of this decline was attributable to higher premium amortization. The work we've done on the balance sheet, over the past year, has allowed us to defend our margin well and should help mitigate future margin headwinds from this challenging yield curve. Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Our third quarter noninterest income increased $3 million over a strong second quarter performance due to ongoing strength in both our mortgage banking and capital markets revenue lines. Also included on the slide is our purchase versus refi percentage for the mortgage business. Lower interest rates in the third quarter led to an increase in refi activity which accounted for 45% of our production. Next, slide 11 shows the trend in adjusted non-interest expenses. As you can see, we experienced a significant decline in adjusted expenses as we have fully realized the benefit of the Klein partnership cost saves following our second quarter system's conversion. Also worth noting is the reduction in occupancy expense this quarter, which included a $1.9 million property tax accrual reversal that will not recur in Q4. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 55.26%, a 341 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2018. Expense discipline is an important part of our culture. And despite the revenue headwinds impacting the industry, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage. Slide 12 has our credit metrics. Credit conditions remain benign as we experience positive migration during the quarter, and non-performing and underperforming loans continue to hover near cycle lows. We recorded $1.4 million in provision expense during the third quarter while posting net charge-offs of $800,000. We've added peer data to our credit slide this quarter for comparative purposes. While we run higher non-performing loans than our peers, we believe our practice of recognizing credit issues early and actively engaging with borrowers leads to better outcomes as evidenced by our below peer average charge-offs. Slide 13 demonstrates our strong reserve coverage and low risk balance sheet. With 60 basis points of reserves against organic loans and 324 basis points in loan market against acquired loans, we believe that we have adequate reserve coverage. Before we turn away from credit, we want to provide you with an update on our transition to CECL. Progress towards complying with the new standard remains well on track for January 1st implementation. Activities in the fourth quarter will be focused on drafting disclosures and finalizing our control and governance framework. Looking to the day one impact of CECL, we currently estimate an increase to our allowance for loan losses of approximately $35 million to $45 million. A large portion of this increase is related to the establishment of an allowance for $2.7 billion of acquired loans with relatively modest increase in reserves on the remaining legacy book. The range reflects the uncertainty of the future macroeconomic environment. But assuming economic conditions remain stable, we would expect to be near the lower end of this range. More detailed information will be provided in our fourth quarter call. Slide 14 provides some key takeaways from our third quarter performance. We are pleased with our results driven by good execution against our stated strategy. We continue to have a disciplined approach to credit risk management resulting in net charge-offs of just 3 basis points and near cycle low on non-performing loans. We are driving positive operating leverage, improving our efficiency ratio and increasing profitability metrics. While loan growth was lower than our expectations, book production and pipeline reached record highs. And we remain optimistic that our ability to produce quality loans without compromising on credit discipline. And finally, we are pleased with the stability in our margin which was down just 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter excluding accretion income and interest collected on nonaccrual loans. Slide 15 includes both our third quarter starting points and our outlook for the remainder of 2019. We expect commercial loan production to remain strong based on both the size and quality of our pipeline. We expect core and net interest margin to be under some pressure from the shape of the yield curve heading into the last quarter of the year. As the slide suggests, fees and expenses should follow normal seasonal patterns and we remain very focused on continuing to drive positive operating leverage. Our fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on an FTE basis and approximately 20% on a GAAP basis. We continue to expect tax credit amortization to be de minimis. Lastly, the cost saves from our Klein Partnerships have been realized and we are very optimistic about our opportunities in Minnesota. With that, we're happy to answer any questions that you may have. And we do have the rest of the team here with us including Jim Sandgren and Daryl Moore and John Moran. Dorothy, we'll take questions at this time. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Good morning, Scott. Good morning  (00:14:06), how are you? (00:14:05) Good. Good. How are you? Good. Good. Thank you. Appreciate you taking my question. I think first question is just on the cost base. Got some really positive momentum here in the third quarter as you had articulated would be the case, so that was a good result. Just curious as to what you're thinking for the fourth quarter? I think in your prepared remarks, you had suggested that we fully realized the client savings. Is it possible that we could see another downdraft in expenses? Or would more flattish kind of be the way you're thinking now that the cost savings are all in there? Yeah. I think flattish from here. I just, Scott, just point you back to the $1.9 million occupancy expense line item that won't be recurring. That keeps us in the low 120s going forward. Okay. Perfect. Low 120s. All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then I appreciate the disclosure on the CECL day one impact. I guess, to the extent you're comfortable, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on what the day two impact will look like as well? Do the – the purchase accounting benefits, do those sort of go away or just sort of get re-categorized into the provision? Do you guys have any thoughts that you're comfortable sharing at this point? Well, I think, what I can share with you, Scott, is that the legacy book and provisioning for new loan growth will be relatively small change moving forward, so not a material impact to how we provision going forward for loan growth. Okay. All right. That sounds perfect. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks Scott. Your next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Morning, Chris. Hey. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, everybody. Quick question on kind of the capital and the growth dynamic. Looking over the past year, you've built a lot of capital despite being fairly aggressive with the buyback. I guess the bigger question is, what turns a loan growth from here? Anything you're kind of – any views on the prepayment activity, what might make that abate a little bit, and also kind of I think you've got about 1.5 million shares. Anything from keeping the company from authorizing additional buybacks? Thanks. I'll let Jim talk about the loan growth, and I will comment on the share buyback. Yeah. As both Jim and Brendon pointed out, pipelines continue to be really strong. Production is great. Hopefully, we'll see a slowdown in payoffs, but private equity continues to be aggressive. A lot of companies continue to sell. They don't have succession plans. A lot of the commercial real estate continues to look to refinance in the secondary market. So, we would like to see that slow, but short of that, we're really just focused on what we can control, and that's taking care of our customers and continuing to show record production. So, that's where our focus is, and then hopefully we'll see a slower level of pay-downs. The other thing that hit us in the quarter is, as Jim pointed out, was the lower line utilization, and so that impacted the balances a little bit. So, hopefully we can see that return in the fourth quarter. So, that can help. Regarding the stock buyback, it's been a good capital management tool, and we're close to the end of our authorization. I would think we want to have that tool in our tool kit if that kind of relative value represented itself to us next year, too. Okay. Great. Your credit numbers were very good. Can you just provide an update on the ag portfolio, what the – any kind of stress there? Any kind of updated thoughts? Chris, this is Daryl. Really, we're going to have to get in to November to really know what's going on there. First is just our farmers bringing in crops from the field. The second is the level of payments that the farmers are going to get. We're really not going to know that for another two to three weeks and that'll have a bit of an impact on their strength. We've talked a little bit about this before, our ag portfolio was down. Most of the customers we have in the portfolio still have adequate equity in their land. So, we've only got about $315 million, $320 million in ag outstanding. So, that is not a portfolio today that concerns us a lot just simply because of the size, and I don't think there's a lot for us today given the current dynamics,  a lot of lost content (00:18:19) in that portfolio. Okay. Great. And maybe Brendon one for you, the tax rate in the fourth quarter, the tick up that you expect, is that kind of fair for 2020 as we look into it? Yeah. I think that's a fair number for the next several quarters. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Race with Piper Jaffray. Good morning, Nathan. Hey guys. Good morning. A question first maybe on the securities portfolio size, obviously, some growth this quarter just given the deposit inflows and the challenging loan growth. So, I guess, from here in the fourth quarter, do you expect it to kind of be a steady state or should we expect some shrinkage as loan growth picks up and perhaps deposit growth slows, just any thoughts? Yeah. I think – well, I think it's a little higher. We pre-purchased when we had some opportunities with the rate environment, given some deposits and given the cash flows that are coming off that portfolio, I don't think we'll grow it from here, if anything, might come down a little bit in the fourth quarter. Okay. Perfect. Helpful. And Jim, just on the operational review that's – that you guys will be wrapping up shortly. Just any sense I guess at this point, and I appreciate that's early in the process in terms if it's going to be more of an expense or revenue-driven exercise at this point. I think the beauty is we'll benefit on both sides of that. The reality is that it's a top-to-bottom review that we hope to deliver better client experiences on the other side of it. And I'm confident that we'll get more efficient and effective as we just reduce redundancy and overlap and then we'll drive more revenue as a result of it too. So, it's really on both sides of it, and it's too early to determine how much is one way or the other, but it's definitely – we're definitely interested in driving more revenue going forward. I think the nice side is you get a little bit cost saves upfront. Okay. Great. I appreciate you guys taking questions. Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Good morning, Terry. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on Nate's question, the internal review. I guess, my question is why now? As an outsider, NII is going to be pressured, mortgage could be pressured next year. Is it simply there's revenue pressure and now's the time to find incremental costs to keep the efficiency ratio stable, and the efficiency ratio already 55%, very respectable. Can that go lower from here in connection with this plan? So, the why now question, I think part of the why now is, obviously, we're entering a difficult interest rate environment which is going to make net interest margin growth challenging, right? So that's part of it. And part of it is, I'm brand new to the seat. I think we all felt like there was better ways we can improve our client experiences. And so, really, the management team went off starting very early on in the year and talked about, hey, are there ways we can do change to get better? And so, we've been working on them for the better part of the year and we're getting close to wrapping this thing up, but it's really been focused on just delivering a better overall client experience. Thanks, Jim. And then a follow-up question, going back to CECL. If I look at the third quarter reserve and just add in the $34 million (sic) [$35 million] to $45 million relative to loans, I'm at 76 to 84 basis points. I'm just wondering will the – do you disclose the unfunded commitment liability? Will that be included in the new reserve next year? And then any other adjustments on the [ph] marked (00:21:57) portfolio? And, ultimately, I'm trying to come up with a reserve-to-loan ratio next year and should I be adding anything to the range I came up with originally? Yeah, Terry. I – I think – I think you're on the right – you're on the right track. We – we're not disclosing the range or what the overall reserve ratio will be right now, but – but your math is – is – the logic follows. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Terry. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Good morning, Jon. Hey, good morning. Question on the margin outlook. I guess, you guys had a pretty good quarter. On a core basis, did better than – than we thought based on what everybody else has been doing. But help us to – I understand you're seeing some pressure, but help us kind of walk through the puts and takes in terms of how you want us to think about the margin in Q4 and maybe early in 2020? Yeah. So, I – I think we're going to see some active yield compression both on the loans and the investment side, but we have – we have some levers to pull in the borrowing side as well as deposits. We have almost 20% of our deposit book is exception price and the big chunk of that is floating. So, we'll be able to pull that lever pretty quickly. The other thing I'd just point to you is the premium amortization headwinds we experienced in the third quarter. Not likely to repeat themselves in the fourth quarter just given – assuming that we don't have another 30, 50 basis point drop in long-term rates. So, we feel really comfortable with the – with a margin compression similar to what we saw quarter-over-quarter. Okay. Good. Okay. And then a couple of other things, the average new production loan size at $750,000, I think the point you're trying to make there is that you're not necessarily taking bigger swings and that it's a granular portfolio. But just curious where you think that number could go over time or do you plan to keep it under $1 million? It's definitely trending higher as we entered Minnesota and some of our newer markets. So you end up having a lot of loans on the small side and a handful loans on a larger side. It's definitely trending higher from – it was a $0.5 million and $1.9 million, but I don't – we don't look at it in terms of, we're trying to target a specific size, but it is just a reminder that our portfolio I think is a little different than most $20 billion banks where I think we are still a business or bank that's focused on medium- to small-sized businesses and we don't go off and do large shared national credits or big club deals for the most part. We have very small portfolios for us. So, I think we're just trying to remind everybody that – I think that helps us in the future if the markets get a little more choppy in terms of credit quality. Yes. Okay. And then, I guess, the last question, the normal seasonal patterns is on fees, you call it out, we understand it, and I guess the question is what are you saying now that you just expect primarily mortgage to pull back a bit in Q4. Is that the big picture message? Yeah. I think that's the big picture message that mortgage, I think it's still relatively strong but it's going to return to – fourth quarter is always a smaller quarter in that business for us. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks. You have a follow-up question from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Hi, Chris. Great. Thanks. Just following up on the impact of CECL for 2020. In the slide deck, you give your expectation for accretive or yield contribution, I guess, dropping by like $80 million. Historically, you've always outperformed that because of prepaid. How do we think about the variance to that $80 million next year, is that kind of what you're expecting given the step down because of accretion in CECL or any kind of help there be appreciated? Yeah. I think that's still an accurate look based on contractual expectations. As you said, pre-pay may result in us having a little more in 2020. I think the only CECL impact you got to be thinking about is that market is no longer available to offset charge-offs. But we don't think that's going to be a hugely material number for us going forward. Okay. Great. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Good morning, Kevin. Good morning. First question is related to what percentage of your loan – commercial loan book is variable and then of that amount, what percentage of the book has floors and where you are – where are you in terms of floors from the book? So on the commercial side, Kevin, we're at 52% variable. We have about 11% of our loans have floors, but they're pretty far outside the money. Most of the floor impact we have really through the kind of macro hedges of that portfolio. And the total portfolio... I'm sorry, you said 11%? ...total portfolio is 42% variable, Kevin. Got it. And the 11% that have floors, is that of the commercial book or the total book? Total book. Got it. And M&A, what are your M&A priorities now, now you've got a nice presence in Minnesota, you're in other markets, kind of how do you think about your M&A priorities from a geographic standpoint and from a size standpoint? Yeah. I think we've been pretty public around that $1 billion to $3 billion – $2 billion to $4 billion is kind of ideal size for us. And at this point, we're focusing most of our energy in footprint and markets that we'd like to continue to build scale in. There are places we're kind of subscale and we've got a nice toeholds, but it'd be nice to continue to grow scale in a few of those markets. But our newest markets, including Minnesota and Wisconsin and Michigan, remain high priorities for us. We'd like to continue to build out parts of Kentucky, but there's kind of limited opportunities there. But those newer markets, continue to build scale in our kind of fastest-growing markets are our highest priority. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Beury with Boenning & Scattergood. Hi. Scott, good morning. Hey. Good morning, guys. I just had one question related to the internal review that you're doing the kind of strategic planning you've been referring to. Does that have any impact in terms of your M&A outlook in maybe potentially restricting you or making you a little bit more cautious? No. No. I think it puts us in a great position to obviously, as we continue to get more efficient, more effective and drive more revenue, I think it puts us in a better seat going forward. So, no, I don't think it really changes our appetite at all. Great. Great. Thank you. And then, most of my other questions have been answered, but I was just curious if you could touch a little bit on the growth that you're seeing in the loan portfolio or the production rather, where is that kind of shaking out geographically across your markets? And maybe if there's anything noteworthy, any thoughts on the competitive dynamics market to market that you're seeing? Yeah. Scott, this is Jim Sandgren. We continue to see some nice growth in a lot of our newer markets, Wisconsin and Minnesota production levels continue to be very, very strong, Louisville, consistently a strong production region for us as well. From a competitive standpoint, it's still pretty out there, very aggressive. And it's a combination, some of the bigger banks are moving a little bit downstream, so we're starting to see them a little bit more than we have in places like Minnesota, Indianapolis and Louisville. And then, there's some goofiness, a little bit sometimes on some structure that we see in some of the smaller banks and even credit unions on some real estate deals, and that's where I think we need to stay very, very disciplined. But, for the most part, obviously, we can continue to grow and show strong production and just fight off the payoff. So, it's a nice mix of our markets and I think we continue to feel optimistic at this point and customers still feel relatively good. Excellent. And thank you. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to our speakers for closing remarks. We appreciate everybody's support and all the good questions this morning. And as always,  Jon (00:31:18) and Lynell are going to be available and Brendon are going to be available for questions all afternoon. Thank you very much. This concludes Old National's call.
